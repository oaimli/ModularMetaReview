            "The Hotel Navona is situated in perfect location to take advantage of Rome's beautiful sights. We were able to walk to just about every historic site and museum within 20 minutes. There are boundless cafe's and osteria's within minutes of the hotel. A main bus line is a two block walk. The plaza Navona, with a fabulous fountain is a 1-2 minute walk from the hotel where you can find numerous restarurants, cafe's, artists and beautiful fountains and evening entertainment. The plaza Farnese is 4 - 5 minute walk with a Wednesday farmers market that is fantistic. The Pantheon is just a 3-4 minute walk from the hotel where more cafe's, restaurants and entertainment await. My wife and I had never been to Rome, but we have traveled extensively over the years. We enjoy places that we can meet people and learn a bit more of the culture and history of places we visit. The owner of the Navona, Cory and his GM Michael were GREAT at providing us tips and insights within Rome. I love the fact that I saw the owner at the hotel every day talking with guests, staff and friends and doing all he could to make his customers feel a part of the city and the Hotel. We stayed at the Novona for 6 nights and we would stay there again. I feel that the price, services, location and assistance provided by the hotel staff met and exceeded our expectations. WE LOVE ROME!",
            "We stayed at the Navona on the first week of our honeymoon (feb 27th to march 2nd). It was VERY clean, perfectly situated (within walking distance of most sites) AND the staff was SO FRIENDLY. We loved our stay there. I'd highly recommend it, even though the morning coffee is instant (which should be a crime in Italy!)",
            "If you're familiar with European two-stars, you'll know what to expect here. The rooms and hotel were clean and comfortable, and breakfast was tasty. I thought the hotel was hard to find (and I never did quite figure out the surrounding streets) but the general location was good. The Piazza Navona is touristy but great fun. The beds were very small, and I think a large person would have difficulty with them. And it is indeed very noisy - I finally wore earplugs to block out the street noise.",
            "This is not the fanciest hotel, but it was quite sufficient for our needs. A nice continental breakfast was included in the price and our room was clean and quiet. The main reason why you would stay here is the location. It's about a two minute walk away from both Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. The Vatican is about 20 minutes away, and the Spanish Steps and Fontana di Trevi are even closer. If you stay here, you can walk anywhere to see the main sights of Rome (unless you also want to see the catacombs, which I recommend...) There are plenty of good and inexpensive restaurants (around Piazza Navona you'll find the good and expensive ones) close to the hotel. If you are staying in Rome for a shorter period of time, you don't want to waste time on unnecessary transportation. Hence, Hotel Navona is a perfect choice for a long weekend in Rome.",
            "Three of us stayed at the Hotel Navona and shared a room. It had two twins pushed together and a separate cot-like bed. We all found the room to be more than large enough and very comfortable. I slept on the cot-like bed and slept very well. Shower worked well. Our room was on a courtyard with a large, heavy oak door. You cannot beat the atmosphere and location. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Location, Location, Location!",
            "I just returned from a one week stay at the Hotel Navona in Rome, where I thoroughly enjoyed what I believe was a true Roman experience. The LOCATION of this place is absolutely ideal, as it is within a few steps of Piazza San Eustaccio, where one can find the best coffee in the City; a few steps from the bus stop which delivers you from Termini Station; a few steps from the Piazza Navona, Romes greatest public space; a few steps from the Pantheon, Rome's oldest fully-intact temple to the gods. This is right where I wanted to be. As far as the negative reviews which complain about the size of the rooms being small, this is certainly true, but this is a small hotel in a very cool building several hundred years old, in an area of PRIME real estate. That character was what I was looking for. And the rooms were absolutely spotless. None of the other hotels where I would even consider staying in this excellent neighborhood (the rafael, albergo delsenato) are in this price range. And the staff were among the friendliest people I met in Rome. I will indeed be going back.",
            "My husband and I spend 5 nights at Hotel Navona. What a great place! Our room was fabulous, spacious, clean, private. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. The location couldn't have been better, close to all Rome has to offer. Breakfast was ok, not exceptional, but suited us just fine. Room didn't have a phone and there was no access to the internet, but when you're on holiday...who needs it! Would stay there again in a heartbeat.",
            "Hotel Navona has an excellent location and the price we paid (90 Euro per night for 6 nights) was excellent. On arrival the lady owner, we assume, asked us to pay cash and not by card as it was supposedly a special late booking offer! This was never mentioned 6 weeks before when we booked through an online agency! I refused and paid by card. Why would anyone be asked to pay by cash unless.......... Room was a bit dated but good character although a bit dusty. I'm not a big breakfast person and not a coffee aficionado but the coffee served was appalling and the diluted orange awful. The bread was nice though. As our stay coincided with the big Roma football (soccer) derby game I asked what the chances were of them obtaining tickets for us as you cannot purchase them online. I was told their local agent would obtain them for us. But alas this did not materialise and fortunately it proved quite easy to obtain them by ourselves as it was less than half full. For a base close to all the sights of beautiful Rome at an affordable price this hotel ticks all the boxes but don't expect anything more. There's plenty of great coffee shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Even though we have more negative than positive (hopefully constructive) criticism I would stay at this hotel again for the location and cost but skip brekkie and ignore the \"lack of\" service.",
            "As other have testified the location is superb, but the hotel is well worth staying at for other reasons too. Newly decorated rooms in a very pretty historical building. We got our room through a Groupon offer and it was very good value. But what impressed us most was the fantastic service provided by the staff. Extremely attentive and friendly! And when we didn't know how to get to Roma Termini to catch the train to the airport, because Rome had had the first snowfall and ice in 30 years and no taxis were available, one of the staff offered to takes us there in his car and then promptly refused to accept any payment for this. We will certainly return to Hotel Navona. Thanks Michele and the rest of the staff!",
            "I stayed at Hotel Navona for a week at the begining of September. It was clean and air conditioned. My room was very comfortable and I found the staff helpful. The location of the hotel was superb. Honestly, I cannot fault the hotel. The next time I visit Rome I will definately stay here.",
            "First of all, I believe there is no better location in Rome. At Hotel Navona, you are right at the center, yet tucked away on a quiet street, taken care of by a warm, caring family. The rooms are clean, quiet, quaint, and comfortable. I remember a delicious dinner at Campo dei Fiori, followed by romantic digestivi at bar della pace, then being warmly welcomed back at the hotel, handed the key, then off to a super comfy bed... No wonder we're going back again this April! I've been going to Hotel Navona since 1985 (but that's another story...), I've recommended it to many friends, and they've all been very pleased to have stayed there.",
            "We arrived at Hotel Navona and met the owner one evening, just before he was ready to leave for the day. The owner was very helpful in a difficult situation. He was willing to go out of his way to accomodate us. We thank him for being so friendly and kind on our first night in Rome! Cheers, mate!",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Navona for 3 nights in November. Loved the location and loved the price! The room was small, but certainly adequate as was the service and the breakfast. We wanted to be near the Piazza Navona and this served our purposes. The hotel is convenient to all the sites. Actually we have just made reservations to stay there again next spring. The only down side would be the flight of stairs from the street to the hotel on the 1st floor, however, I just stayed with our luggage while my husband went up and ask that someone come down for all our bags. Breakfast is very basic and served in a room with tables lined up on either side of the room. As someone mentioned in one of the other reviews, if you're use to the Hilton and don't feel you can adjust, you probably should look elsewhere. Barbara89/ addedoomph@northstate.net",
            "Our family stayed in two rooms that were clean and well-lighted. We both had a \"courtyard\" view but were happy since a clothesline was easily available. The staff was friendly and we enjoyed our continental breakfast very much. When we needed directions, or help, the staff assisted with a smile. A bonus was the fresh flowers at the front desk. To walk to Piazza Navona (and the lovely Bernini fountains) took us a mere two minutes. For a large city like Rome, to be in such a good location with a clean and serviceable room, Hotel Navona is the ticket. Bonus: the bottom floor has an ancient fountain and the whole place is built atop an ancient site. Get Cory to explain the hotel history. Many English speaking staff are available to assist.",
            "Just returned from a stay at theHotel Navona...or should I say an apartment they owned on the Vittiore Emanuelle....a 10 minute walk away. The apartment was booked back in January by an Italian speaking friend, and a price was agreed .Hoever when we arrived there was some dispute over the agreed price and the elderly owner didnt care if we stayed or not. He demanded 20 euros a night more and cash up front.Unable to resolve the issues,wWe proceeded to the apartment...very spacious but very basic.The sheets were darned and had holes in them!! The kitchen had an odd array of chipped crockery and two saucepans that I refused to use as they were so disgusting.The management did agree to change the sheets but as for the kitchen we were told was to be used\" only in emergencies\" and we could go to the hotel for brakfast .....We went to breakfast twice and decided to buy elsewhere as it really wasnt worth the 10 minute walk each morning. At the end of our stay we paid the original agreed fee as we dealt with Cory who remembered the original conversation back in Jan and was very kind and helpful...it was such a pity that the older man and the sour faced woman werent as obliging. Dont think I would make a return to the Navona Interesting to see no one else who has left comments seems to have stayed in the apartment!! !",
            "This was our first trip to Italy and we booked Hotel Navona because of Foder's recommendation. After booking the hotel, I read all the reviews and was very worried about going. We were so pleasantly surprised. It's like a cozy bed and breakfast in a perfect location. We walked everywhere and felt totally safe where the hotel is located. Piazza Navona is a perfect location and the hotel is one block from the Piazza. Our room was exactly like the photo online and it was clean and quiet. The pillows left something to be desired, but the bed was comfortable. The bath was clean and the shower had wonderful hot water. We would recommend bringing your own washcloths and soap because the soap was very tiny and there were great towels, but no washcloths. Breakfast was our biggest surprize. After reading the reviews from some, we thought it would be bad. We had wonderful cappuchino each morning and a pot of tea, orange juice, yogurt and the best fresh baked rolls with butter and jelly. There were also packaged cakes if you needed more. Breakfast was lovely and the staff remembered our choice of drink each day. All in all it was great and we would definitely stay there again. We didn't expect a large hotel and very much like the quaint atmosphere. The staff was helpful and pleasant also.",
            "After reading some previous reviews I was expecting a bare bones room, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was nicely decorated, we were at the end of a hall so very quiet too. Great location, we walked everywhere, one day to the Forum, another to the Vatican. You can't beat this location, and for the room rates in Rome, I thought this was a pretty good deal.",
            "I recently stayed 4 days here with 17 boys and 13 parents. The hotel staff put up with a lot. They were pleasant, always there to help, and got up a 1/2 hour early every day to serve us breakfast. Our last night we left @ 3am.. Our bags were carried to the curb (all of them). Mike had a gift for everyone. While this is not a luxury hotel, it was pleasant , close to everything, clean and the showers worked fine. The Piazza Eustachio is right around the corner (best Cappuccino in Rome). All the locals go here. You are close to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona. Incidentally, The Piazza Navona is named after this hotel (or family). Mike will set you straight on this. Enjoy your stay in Rome. I did..",
            "We recently stayed at the hotel Navona located just off of the Piazza Navona wich was the perfect location to walk to so many of the famous sights in Rome.The most friendly staff welcomed us and were very helpful with all of the questions we had. The room was very spacious and immaculate with windows that opened to the street below with flowerboxes framing them all. The charm and old world feeling we felt was something that truely added to to our Rome experience!!!! !",
            "Premise: I work for an airline and have traveled a lot and stayed in all classes of hotels. This hotel is located just off of via renascimento, 1 small block from Piazza Navona and 1 block from Via Vittorio Emmanuelle. The location is excellent. Walking distance to EVERYTHING: pantheon, trevi, spanish steps, colloseum, jewish quarter, campo di fiori, etc, etc. For that alone this is a great choice. However, the hotel is 1 step up from a pensione... it is located on the 2nd floor of an apartment building with no elevator. The room was sufficient and we had our own bathroom. The water strenth was excellent. There was a little tv with basic cable, so CNN and Italian channels. We had room number 19. There were cobwebs on the tops of the curtains. There were also some funky birds that habitated on the roof of the building and they sounded like a pack of dogs...I think they were shape changers =) they were very loud and scary at night! The breakfast was nothing to write home about. American coffee and some danish in plastic. But it was sufficient. Especially since there were no real coffee bars near enough to enjoy..so it did the trick. For the price, the location makes this a good choice. I love to be near campo di fiori...such a great ambience both during the day with the markets and at night with the restaurants and bars. In my travels I got to see Hotel Raphael and Hotel Campo di Fiori. Both of which are in EXCELLENT locations and look really nice. In retrospect I wish that we had stayed in one of those 2. Enjoy!",
            "We booked this hotel for a family of 9 hoping that it would live up to previous positive comments on tripadvisor. It more than lived up to them, the location is ideally located 2minutes walk from piazza navona, 5 mins from the pantheon and 10mins from the spanish steps. The staff were very friendly and welcoming (in particular Michele), they gave us great recommendations for restaurants and places to see. Excellent value for money.",
            "The Hotel Navona was a pleasant spot which we enjoyed. At a great price on a very cute street, we spent three nights there. The staff were very friendly and breakfast was included. I would definitely recommend it to travelers to Rome looking for a nice, but not luxury spot. We would stay there again. The bathroom was small, but so are most bathrooms in Italy. The room was comfortable and not noisy.",
            "We have been staying at this hotel for two decades, and have marveled at the numerous improvements that the family owners have made across the board. Rooms have been thoughtfully and tastefully renovated, the breakfasts have improved in quantity and quality (ok, their coffee isn't great, but you have the finest caffe in Rome just around the corner in the Piazza San Eustachio), and the staff are kind and knowledgeable. Treat them with courtesy and respect, and you'll be treated similarly. We like the fact that this hotel is large enough to accommodate individual and groups in different wings of its large Borromini palace, and keeps noise down to a minimum by insisting that guests be considerate. If only they could regulate the occasional street revelers outside! - but that's the cost of a central location, I guess. Perhaps their next improvement to the rooms will be better double glazing? For now, the rooms have flat screen TVs, individual a/c units and safes, and en suite bathrooms.",
            "Once you recover from the front desk being on the first floor and having to drag your bags up yourself our room was lovely. Out of some antique picture book and much larger than we expected. it was in the corner of the building was great as it was resonably hot and air conditioning didn't work. Problem was floor was filthy and we needed to were socks. Also our fridge was broken so we couldn't even put water in to cool. Location wise hotel is within walking distance to all of Romes sites. Easy walk to Vatican, Coluseum and Borgia gallery. It's surrounded by lovely resteraunts and a supermarket is about 3 min walk. I'd recomend a gps unit as streets are small and getting lost is easy. Help from staff stopped once we paid which was on arrrival but at least the internet worked.",
            "The service was, well the worst i've ever experienced! There was some who worked there who where forthcomming and helpfull - but I never felt welcome and was spoken to in an extreamly unfriendly and threthening way several times during the 3 days i stayed. The rooms are ok, small bathrooms. The location is central, walking distance to many interesting places in Rome.",
            "Nothing can beat this family run hotel. There is a real pleasure to be treated practically like family when you stay and I am a repeat customer. The building is as charming as the street it is located on. Minutes from all site in the historic sector, yet quiet and intimate. I just can't imagine a better place to stay for someone coming to Rome for the first time, or for returning again and again. It's a wonderful hotel!",
            "Basically, the only positives about this hotel is the central location around the corner from the Pantheon & the staff was friendly and helpful. The room & bathroom was dirty. Our bathroom had a long odd hallway to the toilet/shower which was very tight. the only silver-lining here is that the price was right.",
            "I spent a week in this hotel in the spring of 2004. I should have heeded the warnings on this site. Anytime a hotel insists on cash in advance, it is not a good sign. The room was uncomfortable:cramped, noisy and dirty. The worst part was dealing with the contemptuous and unhelpful staff and owners. You can do much better. Keep looking.",
            "The hotel is well situated but besides that it was expensive :Euros180 per night even though the guidebooks price it as moderate. I asked specifically for a quiet room and received precisely the opposite: traffic and pedestrian noise all night long. The bathroom stank to high heaven and the beds were not comfortable. The breakfast was worse than a McDonalds fast food experience. Cheap, packaged croissant, cheap cereals - nothing to write home about here. Overall I would say this is probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed in on holidayand I am not extremely fussy! The staff were friendly and accommodating although they did not accept a credit card and wanted cash or trveller's cheques in Euros only. A waste of money and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",
            "Like many other reviewers point out, this hotel is in a good, central location. But it wasn't all that pleasant a place to stay. I am a bit picky about decor and found our room to be charmless bordering on depressing. If it was cheaper, I'd feel fine recommending it as a budget option. But at over $200/night, I suspect there are better hotels at a similar price. We only stayed there one night because the apartment we were renting wasn't available until the next day, and I have to say that I'm very glad our stay at this hotel was short. In addition to the lackluster feel of our room, the woman at the front desk was somewhat unpleasant. My husband and I are independent travelers and don't tend to depend on hotel staff for much, but she seemed so put upon even when we asked basic questions about the hotel, such as how to use the lobby phone or what they offered for breakfast. We really didn't like dealing with her. This was our second trip to Rome. We had a great time and will probably return again. Our first stay was at Hotel Campo de' Fiori, which I highly recommend (I wrote a review for it two years ago). Unfortunately, it was booked during our stay this year, but we'll definitely aim to stay there on our next visit.",
            "The hotel is on the first floor of an old building which smelt badly. Despite having booked and paid the first night's stay many months prior, we were shown to a small drab room. For example, access to the shower required stepping over the toilet. There was one single wardrobe. No drawer space. We asked where our shirts etc could be placed and were advised to use the single shelf which also contained the little safe. No other rooms were available that night so we \"walked\" and obtained a hotel elsewhere. Returning the next day to get our money back involved an unpleasant exchange with either the manager or owner. A very poor introduction to Roman hospitality.",
            "This hotel is just off Piazza Navona. It is difficult to find in taxi so make sure you have a map. It is clean and basic accommodation. This is not luxury by any means. It is a good base for sight seeing and walking distance to all tourist attractions. Our room was cleaned daily and the room was also quiet. The breakfast is nothing to write home about! It is coffee and a packaged croissant. Better to eat out. Cheap and cheerful and a base for sightseeing - stay here. Looking for luxury - look elsewhere.",
            "I stayed two nights in Navona - in a tiny single room. Its a nice, clean hotel with great staff that speak English quite well. We all stayed on the main floor which is one flight of stairs up from the street level. I don't recall if they had an elevator, but I don't think so. Very basic breakfast offered. I stayed there with friends and it was during the bus strike and a national demonstration. We ended up walking much of the two days we were there, which was fine because Navona is not too far from the Vatican (about a 15-20 minute walk). Its very close to the Pantheon and there is some good shopping and great restaurants not too far away. Our last night, we ate at a wonderful little trattoria (Tritone, on Via Tritone) about 5 minutes from the Spanish Steps as the owner (or friend of the owner) stopped us on the street and invited us to have dinner with him. It was absolutely wonderful. Our best meal throughout our time in Italy! We walked back to the hotel because we were stuffed. Everything was great in Rome, too bad we didn't have more time.",
            "We highly recommend the Hotel Navona in Rome. It\u2019s centrally located, in the heart of ancient Rome, just a couple blocks from the Piazza Navona and the Pantheon (not to mention that it\u2019s about a block away from one of the best espresso cafes in all of Rome). Also, public transportation to wherever you want to go is right around the corner. It's a very well-run hotel. The owners and staff were warm and welcoming, and also very helpful in sharing their thorough knowledge of the area. A special thank you to Cory, Patricia, Michele, and Farouk! CAUTION: There is only one Hotel Navona, not to be confused with hotels using similar names\u2014to be safe, contact the hotel directly at www.hotelnavona.com. Our room was a Double Superior, which was spacious, clean, and very comfortable (not to mention quiet!). It was an excellent value for the money. The staff served a traditional Italian breakfast every morning (included in the room price). We really enjoyed the yogurt, rolls/croissants, coffee/cappuccinos, juice, and friendly service. If you\u2019re not used to breakfast in Italy, please know that this one is quite good, without having to pay extra\u2014contributing to the value of the hotel. (For reference, if you\u2019re looking for a large American-style buffet breakfast, the larger hotels offer them for somewhere between $35 and $50 per person.) We were referred to Hotel Navona by a relative we totally trust, and now we would recommend it to our closest friends. Based on our positive experience, we fully intend to stay there on our next trip to Rome.",
            "All of the staff at this hotel are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. They will take the time to assist you with just about any request you have. The hotel is perfectly situated for an unbelievable walking tour of Rome. I have stayed in other hotels in the city, and I can say without hesitation, Hotel Navona combines the best of all you are looking for, location, price, value for the money, hospitality, cleanliness, and local knowledge.",
            "The hotel is located in a great area, as we walked to Vacatican and up to Spanish Steps, Roman Ruins. All is there with many small streets with loads of places to eat and at all price ranges. The rooms were clean and bathrooms were exceptionally clean. Only negatives were the breakfast which is coffee and a roll but enough to get you going and staff can be distant. We were locked out one night as there is no central key given for the main area (hotel is located on third floor of large building) and ended up staying with our friend who lives in Rome that night, and we were not aware that we would not be able to get back into the hotel. If you want a good place to rest your head and not have to worry about taxis, buses, or underground, this is the place. We only took a taxi to and from the train station when we arrived and left. I would stay there again. Of course if you need American standards of large rooms and a full breakfast then this is not the place for you.",
            "My family and I had an opportunity to spend two weeks in Rome and chose the Hotel Navona through the recommendation of a friend. In short, our expectations were exceeded and our trip was a resounding success due in large part to the hotel accommodations and its staff. The location is second-to-none with short walks to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona and Campo de' Fiorie. Excellent restaurants are close by and you're just a block from the best espresso in Italy at the Sant Eustachio il Caff\u00e9. We were first timers in Rome and appreciated the assistance of the multi-lingual hotel staff in getting directions and recommendations of sites to visit. Rooms were exceptionally clean and well kept. We were there in the hottest part of the year and appreciated the well running air conditioning. All around the Hotel Navona is an excellent choice for your visit to Rome!",
            "Spent 7 nights, with a party of 5 (2 rooms). Very attractive, but small. Showers in my room were good. Great office staff, very helpful and good English, but the waiters in the \"breakfast\" room were a little stiff... Breakfast was poor... we ended up eating elsewhere... packaged hard rolls, bad coffee, and they guarded you like a hawk for fear you'd take a cup with you to your room. Dining area was very small, with crowded tables in a corridor like setting... Also disappointed that there was no place to sit, either a terrace, living room (except for the 4 formal chairs right by the checkin desk), and no chairs in the rooms (probably not enough room for them!). Also had a thin wall, unusual for such an old building, and heard every word from the room next door, often in the middle of the night. However, you can't beat the location and the bed was extremely comfortable.",
            "We spent about 3 weeks recently in one of Hotel Navona's Apartments (because of the length of our stay). We took breakfast nearly every day at the Hotel and we interacted with the staff re help navigating around town on our own, about buses, tours, banking, restaurants and many other services, all of which they cordially provided. We were in and out of the Hotel at all times of the day and were completely satisfied with everyone we encountered. The owner was present a lot of the time, and we found him to be uniformly pleasant and concerned about our stat. We feel Hotel Navona is a Roman experience not to be missed --- Yes, you haul your luggage up one flight, but help is always available to you. Breakfast with fresh rolls and pots of hot coffee and milk are fine, and yogurt and orange juice and sometimes meat and cheese and fruit round out this good start to the day. The breakfast staff is exceptionally good, sometimes working under extreme pressure when a number of people came in to eat all at once, and they responded to all guests' requests and needs quickly and willingly. We interacted with and asked many questions of all the staff, and they responded to to our enthusiasm about being in Rome with carefully thought-out answers, help and advice. Delivery men bring in fresh linens and food right through the lobby. One is part of the action. The Hotel is in an old palazzo and thankfully retains much of the original feel. It is clean, fun and very Roman. The location is simply ideal. But don't stay here if you want a ritzy hotel with American ambiance. Stay here because it captures Roman hospitality. Don't come here unless you want to sit down with Germans, Brits, Danes and American students and swap stories. Do come here if you want a jumping-off place to Rome, managed by people who try sincerely to match your wishes and needs to yous dreams. We were entirely happy with our choice of hotels. We will definitely stay here again.",
            "I stayed at this location while solo traveling in Rome, Italy. It was conveniently located near Piazza Navona, which is within walking distance of all the major sites in Rome. The hotel is closer to Vatican City - my main focus while traveling in Rome. For the cost I stayed in a very clean, comfortable, and classy room with a simple breakfast. Internet was not easily accessible, which was a bit of an annoyance, but not a major deal for me.",
            "In summary if you are not looking for great American style luxury and would like to be at the center of all Roman sites and nightlife Hotel Navona is a great affordable option. Rooms are spacious ( for European standards), quite and super clean. The hotel is on a quiet alley which is very important as Romans are up till late hours wondering in the streets. The breakfast was continental style, just some bread, juice, coffee to get you started. The hotel is on the second floor and there are no elevators but you may ask someone to help you with the luggage. The Corso Rinascimento ( a big street) is just 2 blocks away and there you can catch a bus to the Train Station and Colosseum. Pantheon, Fontana de Trevi and Spanish Steps are walking distance. The Vatican is about 10 min by bus. The taxi from the bus station costs us 25 euros but the bus the hotel recommends ( i think 42...) takes you just 2 blocks from the hotel. Check on their website and on google maps for more information on that. Have fun!! Ah, if you stay here make sure to try The bakery cinque Lune on Corso rinascimento 89, they have the best pastries I had in Rome!",
            "Loved the Hotel Navona. We found the staff friendly and most helpful after my husband was robbed at Rome train station! They called the embassy, taxis, etc . for us and did what they could. Room was comfortable and clean with a/c. No TV, but that wasn't a problem for us. Breakfast was basic and Italian style...just good coffee and brioche/bread, but I was happy with this, and if you're not, there are great cafes within minutes of the hotel, which has one of the very best loctions in Rome. If you don't want to spend a fortune, want a good location, and are happy with a small, no-frills hotel, I recommend the Hotel Navona.",
            "I stayed here with my finacee and a group of friends. Great location but we had several issues with the Hotel. Although my finacee and I booked a double room it consisted of two single beds pushed together. The room was also small and dark. The breakfast was not worth bothering with - only stale bread and instant coffee. The staff were pretty unhelpful as well. We booked a taxi for a certain time to take us to the airport. We waited in the Hotel reception for the taxi. After half an hour it had still not arrived despite the receptionist promising every five minutes that \"it will be here in five minutes\". Then receptionist then got up and left when his shift was over despite our taxi still not having arrived. He was totally blase about the whole thing. Luckily the taxi arrived shortly afterwards and we just made our flight in time. All this and the Hotel wasnt particularly cheap. We loved Rome and would definitely go back but will be staying somewhere else next time.",
            "Only two positives: large shower and location. Although the shower was large, the room was definitely not. There was a lot of street noise. The staff is not accomodating. It's as if you are bothering them if you need some information. The woman who works there didn't smile once. The staff and owners seemed annoyed to have guests! Not sure what kind of coffee was served at breakfast -- not caffe latte or cappacino and not quite American. A big disappointment for the money.",
            "For my wife's 30th birthday I arranged a trip to Rome and a stay in the Hotel Navona. As a surprise I invited another 11 couples so there were 24 of us in total. I was a little aprehensive of arranging such an event and if the hotel was not up to scratch I would never live it down. I arranged my trip with Micheal on reception who was very efficient and even booked a restaurant for us. The rooms where very adequate for the visit and everyone in our party though that the hotel offered a fantastic location and a certain rustic charm. I read some reviews from Americans mainly complaining about the room sizes etc and I have to state that you dont get 5 star service unless you pay for it. Everyone in our group agreed that they would use it again and I am looking forward to.",
            "Perfectly located in Historical Center just 2 minute walk from Piaza Navona and bus to Vatican and Termini Station. Stayed here about 4 years ago and place seems the same but a little more faded and could do with a lick of paint. Rooms are quite dingy. Breakfast is still a bland 'long life' croissant with a few other bits. Prices in Rome have gone up for everything. Small beer on Piaza Navona was 7 Euros!. 70 Euros for Taxi from airport so you are best to pre-book taxi on internet or take train Rome does not have to be expensive as we discovered when we had the most enjoyable and affordable drinks in a bar followed by a perfect meal in a restaurant in Travestere.",
            "We were booked in the Hotel Navona in March 2011. We were greeted by open garbage in the lower floor \"lobby\", scaffolding and ladders and other dangerous items, poor directions to the 2nd floor where the registration desk is found. We were billed for the full 7 days/7 nights on our credit card more than a month before our travel. After being in our room for less than 15 minutes, to find no security, mould in our shower, and a general uneasiness regarding the staff that followed us, we made arrangements to move to another hotel. Internet service was available - but I was \"escorted\" to a small room and staff stayed behind me while I used it. While trying to check out... we were screamed at and we could not understand what they were saying to us. Language was an issue, but screaming in any language is offensive. We finally just walked out, given we had a taxi waiting. Once in Canada, we attempted to get at least a portion of our money back - to no avail. They said that we did not check out properly - and would not refund one cent of $1400+ Euros. I wanted to sign something - but they wouldn't help me, and the screaming was more than we were willing to listen to... Our safety was more important to us.... it was worth LEAVING. Our new hotel, was fabulous, and made the trip to Rome what it was supposed to be... a beautiful city, with a rich history.",
            "Hotel Navona is located nearby Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. You have walking distance to most sceneries and on top of that a lot of small restaurants in the neighbourhood with reasonable prices and good food. The hotel is small but very tidy, our room was small but had everything we needed including nice beds and the staff was kind and very helpful. Definitely value for money and we will recommend our friends to stay here!",
            "Dont expect too much from this hotel. The rooms are basic and i would say ideal for group travel. Breakfast is simple but nice & filling and keeps you going - Euro breakfast. You can grab more food/coffee around Piazza Navona and other areas if you want. Ideal location!",
            "Stayed for a few days on a Rome trip, trying to keep costs down at the time. For that purpose, this hotel is a great choice. Details... THE GOOD --Very reasonable price - at the time in 2003 it was about $120USD per night --Fantastic location, walking distance to everything (near Piazza Navona) --Accomodations reasonable THE BAD: --Small rooms --Iffy service --Accomodations are very simple, unrefined --Bathroom was tiny If you are trying to see Rome on a budget, this is a great spot. If you are going luxury, don't bother.",
            "Well located, quiet, clean hotel. Much too expensive. Breakfast terrible. We were asked to leave after complaining. And we did. Also fire exits were blocked by breakfast tables. When we pointed this out we were told they would be moved in the morning! After insisting they were pushed a little to one side but still hampered access to the fire exit.",
            "The location is the only redeeming feature of this hotel. Other reviewers have noted that the entrance is one the second floor which truly is a hassle if you have a large and/or heavy bag, and there is certainly no one there to help you. The room was grungy and depressing, just generally worn down. The television had about 5 channels. The staff was either hard to find or not particularly friendly and the breakfast they provided came with neither service nor taste. There are many hotels to choose from in Rome, I recommend not choosing this one.",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Navona's sister hotel; Residenza Zanardelli. The location is a few minutes walk from Piazza Navona, a brilliant location with lots going on at night. The hotel is clean and has good air conditioning but there is nothing else good we can say about this place. The staff were very unfriendly and in fact acted liked we were bothering them on each occasion we passed them. We had amended our reservation since the time of booking and the hotel had no record of this. Despite saying we could pay on check on we were asked to pay midway through our stay. The shower was also a dribble of hot water. The breakfast is at one table with all the hotel guests sitting around it. We had booked a double room but the double bed was in fact two single beds pushed together. For the communial breakfast alone, we would not recommend this hotel. We will definitiely go back to Rome but will give this hotel a miss.",
            "I just returned from 5 wonderful nights in Rome and I would highly recommend the Hotel Navona to anyone looking for a good value in a great location. It is located right between Piazza Navona and the Pantheon, surrounded by lots of great restaurants and interesting little shops. As a woman traveling alone, I felt very safe and I found the neighborhood to be more affordable and less trafficky than others I visited in Rome. The bed was more comfortable than it looked (it was kind of a flimsy looking mattress) and the room was small, but I expected that. It was very clean and bright, which made up for the small size. The breakfast is good by Rome standards, but if you're expecting eggs & bacon, you won't find it. I had yogurt, OJ, hot tea and a roll and found it was enough to keep me until lunch. One thing to be prepared for about this hotel is that you have to go up two flights of stairs just to get to the front desk. If you have a lot of luggage, this could be hard. Also, it can be a little noisy outside, especially if you're trying to nap in the middle of the day. At night, it wasn't as noisy. I didn't rely on the front desk for much, but they were able to arrange a taxi back to the airport that arrived exactly on time, which was greatly appreciated. Overall, I had a great time and would highly recommend Hotel Navona to anyone looking for a phenomenal deal in the best neighborhood in Rome.",
            "Hotel Navona is in perfect location if you want to walk around touristic places in Rome. Pantheon is ohh so near from here. The Hotel is in a nice quite bylane, though turn the corner and you can enjoy finest caffee at Sant Eustachio (ask Caffee banco - on the bank, if you don't want to cough up 4 Euros for a latte). Owners are very nice, were very friendly with us and our younger son. Breakfast, as some other reviewer said, is ordinary, though there are lots of places where you can fill yourself up before you start off your day. Room has a safe locker which helps - Rome has loads of theives, so be careful with your stuff. No problem what so ever with Shower, though they could not get the cooler started - it was hot on 5th April. One thing I would like to mention is the lady staff overquoted the taxi fare to Ciampino Airport on the day of departure. She quoted 50 EUR and when I let her know what I paid 30 on the way from airport to their hotel, she revised the fare to 35 EUR. That was little dishonest I think. Apart from this, this place was wonderful to stay and explore Rome by foot. Oh, and I want t o mention about thisPizzeria (not on tourist radar) that just makes us go gaga over it. Name is Pasquales Pizzeria its on Via dei Prefetti. Family run, frequented by locals and his daily customers, the pizzas are delicious and so is their home grown vine.",
            "This is a very good option for staying in Rome. Location is very good, rooms are clean and spacious, breakfast can at least get you going and the staff....well....just remember you are not there to socialize. I am sure their ratings would be way better if they were a bit friendlier. I would stay here again . An excellant value for the money.",
            "If you wanna stay in a nice quiet hotel which is clean and cheap with great service, this hotel is perfect for you. First and foremost thou are the location location location. Located a stonethrow from piazza Navona you have easy walking distance to millions of restaurants, shopping, the pathenon, the trevi fountain etc etc. And both the vatican and the colloseum is only a 10-15 min walk away. The rooms themself are not the biggest, but they are very clean, and have nice showers/toilets, a good size bed and the daily service is good. There is an easy to use safe, and if you ask, you can get a room with nice working and quiet aircon. The staff is divided into 2 groups. The main receptionists are friendly and very helpful and speaks fluid english. The bellboys and waiters are reserved and not very helpful. There are only 2 downsides we could think of. There is a lot of stairs and small corridors, so not a very good choiche for disabled people, and the breakfast is realy just a piece of bread and some wrapped pastry. But we didnt mind since we eat breakfast on the move mostly. So in short - if were going to Rome again were gonna stay here 100% and were gonna recomend the place to all friends.",
            "My wife and I bring fifteen to eighteen students to Italy every summer. We need a place in Rome for five days/nights that is accessible to the major sites and has a reasonable cost. Hotel Navona fits the bill for us. The clean rooms are cozy and have an old world feel about them. Great flat screen tv's have satellite coverage. The staff, Mike especially, along with the wonderful Natale family have been so helpful to us. On our last stay one of our students came down with a peculiar illness and after a visit to the hospital they all took such great concern for our young man; going so far as to make soup for him (Thank you, Mama Tina) and later on some homemade spaghetti (Thank you, Mike). I left my phone in a taxi and they helped me locate it. A great place to stay in the center of historic Rome, Hotel Navona has our return business.",
            "We stayed one night at Hotel Navona and one night at the Residenza Zanardelli and enjoyed both hotel (same owner). The Zanardelli is a bit more upmarket with more attention to the furnishing details, however the room we had at the Navona Hotel was more spacious and quiter. The Zanardelli Residence is on the first floor of this amazing XIX century building whereas the Navona Hotel is in a less sumptuos buiding, but with a lovely courtyeard in the middle. Both hotels could do more of an effort with their breakfast service. Both hotels are extermely conveniently located.",
            "We were two senior couples looking to explore Rome on foot. We don't require 4 or 5 star luxury at outrageous prices. Hotel Navona provided an excellant location with clean utilitarian rooms at reasonable cost. Breakfast was coffee, rolls, juice, yogurt, etc. Less than what Americans are used to but more than adequate considering the marvelous lunches, dinners, gellatto, etc. we ate every day elsewhere. We had no street noise issues. The one negative is its 1st floor (not ground) location and no elevator. The staff was very friendly and helpful especially Michael who seemed to live in the lobby. He was always there and extremely helpful.",
            "The hotel is in a great central location and is in easy walking distance of all the major attraction of Rome. It was generally clean and our room on the top floor was small but comfortable. The only downside was the shower curtain had seen better days. Breakfast was simple; 1 large bread roll with condements, packaged crossant and good dark coffee, but that set you up well for the morning and a easy lunch on the street. For dinner there are some very good restaurants on the other side for Piazza Navona down Via di Tor Milina.",
            "The Hotel Navona was not what I expected at first, but after a few minutes of peeking around and meeting the staff while checking in, I knew that this is the only place I want to stay when in Rome. The owner and staff were so very friendly and knowledgable. The owner talked to my family and friends for over half an hour about the buildings history, his family, his life, and about the city. We learned so much. The rooms were super clean, and the beds amazingly comfortable! It was exactly what I needed after the flight! They only offer breakfast, but large groups can ask about possible dinner options. Again, the staff was just wonderful. It is a little off the beaten path, but it was easy to walk to all the major sites. It was tucked away down a little street which meant it was nice and quiet. When I go back to Rome in a few years, I already know I want to stay there for location, comfort, and the hospitality.",
            "My wife and I just stayed at this hotel with 2 friends for several nights. It is in a great location in the center of Rome. The Pantheon and the Piazza Navona are just a few minutes walk away. You are very close to lots of food and shopping. The price was excellent for being in the center of Rome in season. The rooms were clean and roomy. The hotel staff was very good. Mike and the hotel owner were great and helped us with any reservations and ideas for outings that we needed. A simple breakfast comes with the room, bread, juice, coffee/tea, but if you are looking for something more you will need to go out. This is not a luxery hotel with alot of amenities, but if you are looking for a great location, clean quiet rooms at a good price, this is a great choice.",
            "Hotel Navona is located just steps away from Piazza Navona. Rooms are small, but that is normal. Prices were very reasonable for the area. The negative: very noisy. The street the hotel is on is loaded with mopeds that seem to come and go all through the night. Before 6 am people are in the street yelling, and the mopeds are coming and going. Ask for a room overlooking the small courtyard if possible. Or, better still, ask for a room in their other hotel Rezidenza Zandarelli, located near the Piazza Navona, only at the opposit end. No elevator, and with 3-4 flights of steps to climb 3-4 times a day...you'll get a workout. No internet in the rooms, only the lobby and you are free to use the breakfast room for WiFi. Breakfast was fine. The standard bread rolls, and cornetto. Coffee was terrible....I know, I couldn't believe it either. I think they try to serve American style coffee by brewing espresso, and adding water, but they would do better to offer the espresso. Bathroom was a good size, with a tub/shower combo that was fine. Hairdryer worked well.",
            "We stayed in a two bedroomed apartment just round the corner from the hotel and it suited us very well. The staff and manager were very helpful and friendly. We were taken for a coffee by the manager and he told us a lot about the area and the building. The hotel represents excellent value for money (we paid less than 50 euros each per night) and is perfectly located. The bedrooms in the apartment were spacious, well furnished, the beds were comfortable and the water was hot! We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others and am sure we will stay here next time we are in Rome.",
            "Having booked this hotel on reccommendation from a hotel inspector (I work in the industry), I was then horrified to read the reviews on this site. Without reading the reviews I would have been disaapointed with the hotel, however I dont think the hotel is as bad as some of these reviews may hint. The biggest selling point is location - Piazza Navona is perfect with traders and many pizzerias, Vatican is 15 mins walk as are the Spanish steps. The hotel is more of a b&b. I guess your stay would depend on what room you had as all are different. Ours was small but clean, so we were happy going out all day and just crashing out overnight. Staff werent rude, no more than any other hotel we stayed in - we had hot water problems and they ensured it was fixed within minutes. On our last night we paid \u00a350 more and stayed at the Mecenate Palace, staff were terrible but worth the \u00a350 extra",
            "A friend and I stayed at the hotel this year for five nights and found it perfectly located for all of the places we wanted to visit. We loved the inside/outside stairway - it just added to the fun. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We had to cancel our first planned visit due to a bereavement and the hotel immediately sent their condolences and offered to transfer our stay to a later date. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay somewhere with character and charm that'll put them on the doorstep of so many Roman wonders!",
            "great value considering the FANTASTIC location nestled between piazza navona and the pantheon (each a 1-2 minute walk away !) plus the vatican, trevi fountain, spanish steps, trastevere and colosseum/forum are EACH within a 20 min leisurely walk. Rooms, ameneties, breakfast are fair (not great) but for the price, to get better in that location you would have to pay close to double the price and the rooms will likely not be any bigger as all the buildings in the historic center are, of course, centuries old. At least their rooms are very clean. English is spoken by the mostly non-italian staff and they are quite friendly. I have stayed there twice now and the latest time, the room was tiny but the shower-head strength(on an upper floor) was amazing ...and hot ! (a real luxury in Rome where many homes, hotels do not have showerheads and you have to hold the hose ...a real pain. Again, a real good deal if location is paramount and you' re not looking for \"american\" style comforts and room size. I grew up in Rome a few blocks away from there and the location (for a tourist) cannot be beat ! hig",
            "This is a charming little hotel right in the historic district two steps away from the Plaza Navona and an easy walk to the Forum and the Coliseum .There is a lot to see and places to eat nearby . There are excellent bus connections nearby that can take you there also and to the shopping, St Peter's cathedral area and most anywhere else. The building dtes from the 1400's and the rooms are modern but small. The whole place is cosy. The breakfast which is included is European style, breads, juice and coffee and some sliced meats and cheese. We found the staff very helpful and accommodating.",
            "This hotel is situated in a perfect location for walking and sightseeing. However, the rooms were loud and the staff was apathetic and not friendly. In fact the owner was boderline rude and certainly arrogant. Although the location for the price was good, we would not stay here again.",
            "We have stayed at Hotel Navona for four years in a row when we bring college students to Rome for a class. Our experience with this hotel has been exemplary. The front desk service is extremely helpful, making transportation arrangements for airports and field trips. They go out of their way to supply maps, early morning breakfast, and even making soup for a sick student. The double rooms are perfect for our needs with good showers, large flat screen TV's, and Wifi. The rooms are clean and charming with the ceiling of our room even painted with fresco's. And, of course, the location is the best, being only 2 minutes from the Pantheon and Piazza Navona and a 15 minute walk to St. Peter's and the Roman Forum. The Natale family, owners of the hotel, take a personal interest in making this a hospitable and enjoyable stay. It is truly a family hotel with the personal touches of people who care. We will happily continue to stay at this hotel each year. Emily Ivey",
            "If location primes OK otherwise: noise with the windows closed, you can hera a hairpin drop in the street, and as your in central rome, the quiet moments to hear hairpins drop are rare. ugly: neither old nor new, a copy of old done on the cheap uncomfortable: the pillows could be cofortably repalced by wooden head rests, the mattress is best left unqua lified unpleasant: I read a review saying they disliked american. I spoke only unaccented French and it did not improve the service. The bathroom: I have seen better in youth hostels: from low pressure to raspy towels, and two people can not fir in too brush their teeth together Breakfast, Ha breakfast... we chose not to brake the fast.. Avoid if you intend to sleep., OK to store your bags in central rome.",
            "If you need a place with a grand lobby and multiple servants to tip everytime a door opens, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a wonderfully comfortable room in a quiet, antique location, and you want a true Roman experience, with a wealth of incredible restaurants in the vicinity, please check out this hotel. Very clean and friendly Pension. We had a large room with four beds, and were very comfortable. Continental breakfast included, is served quickly and has a nice variety. Situated one block from Piazza Navona, and easily within walking distance to the Capitola, the Pantheon, the Spanish Steps, the Forum, and even the Colosium, you cannot beat the location. We were there for the celebration of the Epiphany and Rome was buzzing with people and toy Befanas everywhere. The owner, Corey (Corrado) speaks fluent English, as does most of his staff. Their site: http://www.hotelnavona.com",
            "This hotel was recommended by neighbor who stayed here several times. We had a great time here. Location is great, along quiet street, staff and proprietor are very helpful and easy going people. It was nice having breakfast in hotel before our daily long walks exploring Rome. Definitely will come back to Hotel Navona again. Alexander Lezhen. New York City",
            "So... After a long plane ride, we arrived to find that they had given our room away to a German couple named Whithead, no joke... But Mike was quick to rememdy the situation and gave us one of their apartments close by. We later found out that it had been in his family since its construction some time in the 18th century. So rather than having a king room with a private bath for $120 a night, we had an apartment with a king bed, dining room, sitting room, kitchen and private bath. This was all at the same price as our room in Navona. In short, Mike made the best of a mix-up, as any conscientious business owner should do.",
            "Had the good fortune to be back in Rome and naturally stayed at the Hotel Navona. Once again the experience was fantastic. What makes this hotel so great other than the perfect location? The staff, especially Mike! I will never stay at any other hotel in Rome!",
            "This was my 9th trip to Rome and I could not have been at a better location, just steps from my favorite place, The Piazza Navona. The hotel has several floors and is a former 14th Century Palace. It has been converted and upgraded w/ AC and other accommodations. Although Wi Fi is advertised in the lobby area only, we stayed in suite # 5 and had great access. Our room even had 14th century paintings on the ceilings! Just lovely. The owner is friendly and accommodating as well as the staff and there is someone there 24/7 to assist you. I would Recommend this place to anyone looking for that European Flavor.",
            "We initially booked for Hotel Navona and when i was confirming before our trip they said they had to put us in their sister hotel Residenzia Zanardarelli. It was only a block away but it was great! Even though there was a price difference they didn't charge us. The communication pre-visit was great with directions and clear pricing. Location of the hotel is perfect. i really really recommend it as its walking distance from so many sights and a short short bus ride to the Termini to catch the train to the airport. I would def stay there again. Lots of great restaurants nearby and the close vicinity to Vatican City allows you to get a head start on the queues there! A tour bus stop is right across the street from the hotel also. Lots to do in the city so you don't want to waste time with transportation. Enjoy Roma!",
            "Our group of 9 couples stayed at the Hotel Navona for three days before boarding a ship for a cruise. We found the hotel to be extremely convenient. You could walk anywhere within a few minutes up to 15 minutes. The hotel was clean and quietly located. The only problem was that our van could not go down the small street to drop us off or pick us up but that was a minor inconvenience. If you want to spend your time seeing the historical attractions stay here. You won't waste time trying to catch buses or cabs. Every morning homemade hot rolls, pastries, coffee, tea, and juice was provided for breakfast.",
            "We had a family group of 13 ranging in age between 9 and 87 and stayed six nights at the hotel. We had six rooms and we were put on the first floor down the hall from the front desk. The rooms were very clean and quite large for a European hotel. The one triple room we got was very large. The bathrooms were good size with good water pressure and good hairdryers. The rooms that fronted the hotel were quite noisy with street traffic, but we used earplugs and were fine; so you might want to ask for a back room. The staff was geat! The owner and Mike were very informative about Rome's history, restaurants and even set up transportation to and from the airport for our large group. The breakfast was coffee, teas, juice and rolls- enough to get you started. We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Navona!",
            "I have been coming to Hotel Navona for almost two decades. The Hotel has always given me a warm welcome and they have become like family to me. I am quite surprised by the comments that some travellers have made of this family-run establishment. Being a family run business, complaints are taken personally, not as in a large hotel chain. I mention when things need to be fixed, exchanged or improved but in a polite manner. If you have an attitude that you are unhappy and everyone on either side of the reception desk should know it (we've all met travellors like that) then a small hotel (at a reasonable rate) in Italy (or most of Europe) is not for you. A traveller coming to Rome has to appreciate the high prices that hotels now command given that the Euro has more than doubled the cost of visiting the Eternal City. This sometimes makes it difficult to find a decent, well priced and safe place to stay, especially if you are a female travelling alone. Hotel Navona has provided me with this type of safe environment and this encouraged me to stay there alone or with my family. The rooms are clean, comfortable and the many renovations over the years now guarantee me windows with double-glazing that prevents the outside noise from coming in. The (very) light breakfast in the morning is welcoming but as some guests have written, if you want more than juice and a fresh bun, there are plenty of restaurants or bars within a few minutes walk that offer a greater variety. I've found this small hotel is always improving and always accommodating. If you are used to the large North American style hotels and amenities without the old world character, than this is not the place for you but of course you are going to have to pay a substantial premium to get that kind of service. Mirella- Toronto, CANADA - March 2007",
            "This hotel was suggested to us by someone who had recently been there. Having never been to Rome we were happy for a suggestion. The hotel is located 1 block from the Piazza Navona, the most beautiful Piazza in all of Rome. We were there for 4 days and walked everywhere including Vatican City from our hotel. The room we got was small but comfortable and service was great. The breakfast was so-so but was available. Our son went there on their honeymoon this past summer and were very pleased as well. I would go back there any time.",
            "This being our first time to Rome, we were in the dark regarding where to stay and we were extremely fortunate to have found the Hotel Navona. It is within a block of Piazza Navona - THE place to be every evening after dark for couples, families, or just alone to soak it all in. In regards to location, there is no better place - it is so close to it all but still set back enough to be extremely quiet. We walked everywhere with our 5-year old from the hotel to include the coliseum, Pantheon, multiple churches (there are many in Rome! ), the Vatican - although a bit far, Spanish Steps, all from the hotel. The room was sufficient for our needs and they even placed a small bed in the room for our daughter and she appreciated the attention. If you plan to see Rome and not hang out in your hotel room then this is a perfect hotel. If you are looking for amenities and luxury and to be catered to then perhaps you should keep looking. Clean and quiet and simple. Great for sightseeing in this great city. Included breakfast is merely sustenance but coffee was good. Air conditioning worked fine. Plenty of hot water and water pressure.",
            "Four of us made our bi annual trip to Rome for the rugby international between Italy and England on February 10th. Italy were very unlucky not to win the encounter for the first time, so it was a real bonus to be staying in the Hotel Navona, to discuss where England nearly came undone! The staff and especially the owner Corry and his interesting family, were great. The rooms were clean and spotless, with new beds installed for our arrival, plus the hospitality in showing us around this unique hotel was second to none. In terms of value for money, can't fault the Navona and will be going back for our next trip in 2010, if not before!",
            "I've stayed in this hotel twice and have found it to be clean. The staff arent going to love you to death and the owner is a little too pleased with himself - but thats ok - because I didnt come to Rome to spend the day shooting the breeze with them. The breakfast, breakfast room and staff serving it, leave much to be desired and you wont be missing out if you dont have it ,and thats what I recommend you do, as there are plenty of nice places you can go to near the hotel for fresh coffee and bread. The hotel is in a great location and for \u20ac140 a night you are not going to get much better, so would all those who are looking for 5 star quality (based on the other reviews here) do everyone else a favour, unlock their wallets and pay $500 a night for a hotel where they'll get what they want. You wont get much in New York for $140 so why expect it elsewhere. I cant believe some of the negative reviews here. One even complains about audible noise when in the room during the day. What were they doing there during the day??? Another complains about insufficient room in the bathroom for two people - please!!!!!!! This is one of the great cities of the world - the hotel is in the centre of it - quit complaining, get out and see it. If you walk the legs off yourself during the day, like you should - you'll be too tired in the evening to care about the five star niceties that are missing in Hotel Navona.",
            "I stayed in the annexe at this hotel recently and was most impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the family who own it. The rooms were clean, well priced and in a fantastic location right by the Piazza Navona. It was an excellent base and I would not hesitate to recommend it",
            "The position can't be faulted. My room was so small I couldn't swing a flea let alone a cat but the positives - it was clean and close to everything. My negative was the awful bed and pillow. After walking until I couldn't walk another step I wanted a bed in which I would be comfortable to sleep but my bed resembled a block of concrete and the pillow was no softer and so thin as to be useless. The breakfast was filling if nothing and I loved the orange juice served in a plastic cup. Would I stay there again - yes but I would ask for a different room that was a bit larger and take my own pillow.",
            "Not to be confused with any other \"Hotel Navona\" as this place is the real deal. There is only one Hotel Navona in Rome, Italy and we loved staying there. WIth wonderful, hospitable staff and really nice rooms especially for a family of four. The hotel was handy to the centre of Rome...walk to everything.",
            "This is the third time we have stayed at either this hotel or the Residenza Zanardelli which is on the other side of the piazza and owned by the same people. The location is near our favorite and best piazza in Rome and most of the popular sites are within walking distance. The staff is always helpful and the rooms are comfortable and clean.",
            "Great Value, Great Service. Clean Rooms, Terrific Area, Cold A/C, Hot Water. Close to all tourist attractions,We walked everywhere. Located steps from the Piazza. Hotel Staff was helpful. We felt very safe in our rooms. Breakfast was typical Italian. Pastries etc. So we ended up eating out. There is no elevator, the stairs aren't that bad, might be difficult if your older. Staff supplied us with computer when we asked. They called cabs, gave directions, suggested places to eat. Rooms where clean, sheets where crisp. We had a tv in our room, there is no phone within the room itself. The hotel does sell phone cards, which is a benefit.",
            "This is a great find in Rome. Perfect location, clean, quiet room, good AC. The staff is very nice. For example, they called a restaurant for us to obtain a reservation and had good recommendations. I would highly recommend this hotel for someone who wants a simple, clean place to stay while you explore Rome.",
            "Although the hotel is well positioned, the rooms are nothing like the pictures shown on the website. Our standard room did not have air conditioning as stated in the web site and the room was small to the extent of being claustophobic The attitude of the owner left much to be desired, as when challenged the rooms did not match the picture on the website, we were told \" You are paying for the location not the room. The exterior of the courtyard was dilapadated and uncared for. Breakfast while included was very sparse \" a roll and cup of coffe and fruit juice out of plastic cups\" An experience to avoid",
            "This hotel is located within steps of all the major sights. It is literally one block from the Piazza Navona. Overall the rooms were small, some smaller(tiny) than others, we've experienced both. The beds aren't comfy, but who cares if your out all day. This is definitely a no frills hotel; its main advantage is the LOCATION. Mike, the receptionist, was very accomodating and spoke english.",
            "Absolutely the worst bed i've ever slept in. Taking a shower was a real chore. the ceiling in the shower was less than six feet high. The water temperature was ice cold three out of four days. The server at breakfast was rude at best. Packaged Croissants for breakfast and weak coffee. The other guests in my group thought the front desk help was rude and un-helpful, however; i found her sexy charning and most inviting. Do not take a shower after 7:30 am. or the water will be less than room temperature. make sure to have an appointment with your chiropractor after leaving this dump.",
            "In May, we emailed Hotel Navona for a room for 5 nights iearly October and got back an immediate response that the hotel was full but that they could provide a small apartment near the hotel for $175 E per night. We telephoned to make sure we understood the arrangement and booked the stay. When we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that we would be staying in \"the family palace\" and had no idea what we had let ourselves in for, The owner drove us to the \"palace\" and explained that it had been owned by the family since the 17th century and that they had only recently converted a few rooms to small apartments. We were very pleasantly surprised to find ourselves in a delightfully charming apartment on Corso Vittorio Emanuele with a large bedroom, a sitting room, a kitchen, and a small bathroom. We were on the fourth floor but had a lift and Navona staff brought our luggage in and put it in a taxi for us when we left. There were double windows that blocked out noise from the street but allowed a great view--down Corso on one side and into a central courtyard on the other. We were about 3 blocks from Piazza Navona and less than 2 from Campo di Fiori, right on major bus lines, next door to an excellent coffee/cafe shop that opened at 6:00 and had great, inexpensive coffee and breads and pastries in the morning and soups and sandwiches at lunch. The family that owns Hotel Navona could not have been more pleasant and accommodating, as was the staff. I would definitely plan to stay here again.",
            "My husband and two 11 year old daughters stayed at this property in Rome. It's about a 60 euro trip from the airport (FCO), along the way you see a lot of Roma. The location is great, walking distance from anything you'd like to see. Everything! A stair climb is required. They had our room ready, it was clean...and of course very old. Not posh. No frills. Pretty simple. The woman at the desk is very busy, speaks English. Wi-fi only works from the lobby, probably because of the very ancient thick walls. A simple breakfast off coffee and pastries. They were all very nice to us. We would stay there again.",
            "This hotel was great value for money - even though our room did not have any of the features advertised - no view, no frescos, nothing ancient about it - a tiny room stuck in the corner of a hallway. But the bed was the most comfortable of the four hotels we stayed at in Italy, the bath room was super modern - the whole thing was very clean - there was a small safe in a cupboard for valuables. There was a clothesline just outside a door (that opened onto a central courtyard) that we used to dry socks and undies. The lady at the desk was very helpful arranging tickets. the AC was controlled by a remote, and although they turned it off everyday when cleaning the room, it did not take long for the room to be cool enough and actually cold during the night. This will be \"our hotel\" in Rome.",
            "We were only at this hotel for a few days en-route to a cruise and really wished we could have stayed longer. Rooms were lovely, it was perfectly situated and you really knew you were in Rome, unlike some of the other hotels where you could be anywhere! The staff were wonderful and the owner totally made our trip to Rome, by telling us some great places to go and even taking us for a coffee in Rome's best coffee house. When I go back to Rome, I wouldn't stay anywhere else!! !",
            "We just returned from our stay at the Hotel Navona in Rome. We had visited Rome twice before and are well aware that most of the rooms and bathrooms are small by American standards. Our room was small, which was fine. The room was clean and very basic - no complaints with that. Our room was on the top floor and the man that showed us up referred to it as an apartment - don't know why. Now the bad part. The walls were paper thin and we could actually see light from the room next to us from a space where the wall did not meet the ceiling. We were able to hear the neighbor on one side of us every time she coughed and that was the side that had our bathroom separating the rooms. The room on the other side was more of a problem. Although in any other hotel it probably would not have been an issue, at the Navona the walls were so thin we were able to hear EVERY word of their conversations, EVERY time they used the bathroom as well as their nightly romantic adventures. Although their bathroom separated their room from ours, it was as though they were IN OUR room. I will say the location is great - close to many of the sites as well as great restraunts and right around the corner from a good coffee shop. The breakfast was ok - coffee, OJ, a large french roll and several types of cellophane wrapped cakey things that i would recommend avoiding. The prices in Rome are very high by US standards. we paid 145 euro per night here which was much less than most of the other places i saw online or in guidebooks that did not have as good of a location. One other thing worth mentioning for those who travel with lots of luggage - there is no lift/elevator.",
            "My teenage son and I were very pleased with the comfort of our room (and easy access to WiFi), but mostly we were impressed with the kindness, courtesy and efficiency of the hotel staff who assisted in many details and small matters that made our 7-day stay very positive. The rooms are secure and well maintained, the furnishings comfortable, the air conditioning welcome, and the location is centrally located to major attractions. I would recommend highly and will gladly book a visit again."

            "It was our first time in Key West with my family and as soon as I get to the hotel it was terrible. The bathroom smelled like sewer water, the front door couldn't open wider, it felt like we were in a motel. Why would marriott make this kind of hotel but it really is not a hotel it's a motel. I don't recamand this hotel (motel).",
            "Was a bit further away from all the downtown Key West activities than I expected, but nice facility. Helpful staff. Very nice pool area and great free breakfast buffet in the pool area. Room was kind of cramped with very small bathroom. Not a lot of storage or room to put your suitcases, but adequate. I know I read reviews before about the air conditioning units being loud and it's true. If you are a light sleeper, I'd take ear plugs. Only real complaint I have is the pool area is supposed to close at 11:00. All the rooms open up to the pool area, so any activity out there at night can be heard. There was a large group of mostly men that decided to play dominoes. The constant talking and shuffling of the dominoes on the tables echoed throughout the courtyard area and had to be keeping everyone awake. This went on until 2am or so. I would have thought the hotel staff would have cleared them out.",
            "I found this hotel to be a perfect location for a fun weekend in Key West. The room layouts were unique, spacious and clean. The pool area provided a quiet nice hide away for the morning after the night on the town. This hotel was a quick 5 minute, or $4/person cab ride to Duval St. and dozens of restaurants and pubs. Close to everything, but not a walk to downtown.",
            "We recently stayed here during our 2 days in Key West. It was quiet, rooms were clean, staff pleasant. The pool is awesome with 12 small fountains spraying into it during the day. Complimentary breakfast is served poolside--nothing spectacular on the menu, but it's a very pleasant way to start the day. Would recommend it, although farther up the island (northeast?) are other places that are directly across from the seawall and might offer better Gulf access/views.",
            "Just got back from Key West for my sister's 30th. Key West is GREAT! But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what this review is for - Fairfield Inn offered a great front desk team. They were very attentive, informative and friendly. Whether you needed a cab, directions or suggestions on where to eat - what beach to visit - or the best night club, they offered a long list of suggestions with pros and cons. The rooms were quite small though. There were 3 girls in ours and we constantly needed to move out of the way for someone to walk by. However, the beds were GREAT! Very soft and cozy (down pillows). Room 222 offers a lovely view - of the Taco Bell's roof next to the hotel too! Also, this is more of a motel (rather than hotel) - so not sure why they didn't have seats outside the rooms - seemed to have enough room. The pool was very refreshing, and a nice size with plenty of chairs - you never had that feel that the pool was over crowed. My big beef was the location. We took a cab about 4 times a day into Downtown or the beach. With being 5 of us (about $20 a ride) - this was split and generally inexpensive - but I think next time I visit Key West, I'll buck up the extra money and stay at a better location",
            "The Fairfield Inn is the absolute best value and the staff is nothing short of fantastic. From Lyndsey and the girls at the front desk to Pete our daily bartender to the sweetest breakfast staff, they are what made our trip so memorable. Can't thank you enough for showing our family such hospitality!",
            "Yes the hotel is a bit far from Old Key West, but we walked and had bikes and it worked for us- Service- very proffesional staff- Front desk, pool bar and breakfast staff were all friendly and had a nice greeting each time we walked by. The pool was clean and never crowded. Another note on service- we had a room without a fridge-we asked for one at check-in and we were told it would be right up( we expected a long wait) we put our luggage on the bed and there was a knock on door and the fridge was delivered! Other nice touches-the internet is free and there are TWO computers with a printer right off lobby. There is a bike rental on site and the bike/scooter storage rack is in garage and covered and safe.The breakfast is more than enough to get you started for the day- Taxis were always waiting and there is a Trolley Stop on site ( Trolley is $$$$ -walk, rent a bike or try the public bus) We totally agree on the LOUD air conditioner-we had to shut it off at night- we turned it down as cold as it could before we went to bed and then shut it down-",
            "The staff was very Friendly and helpful. They had some good info for our sightseeing. The room was very clean. It was a little small but ok for our needs. The A/C was a little noisey but you get used to it. I would reccomend this place to friends and family.",
            "Overall the hotel is old, the reception area is good, the pool area very good, but the rooms are awful, we stayed in room 118, the tv remote did not work (ok you can live with that), the air con did not work on auto so had to be on all the time to keep the room at a comfortbale temperature, the drains had a problem in the shower, when you took a shower there was a terrible sewarage smell, the room was small and shabby, but on a positive side the bedding and towels were clean. I did complain about the room at reception and they apologised and we were only staying the one night.",
            "The wife and I are fresh back from 3 days at the Fairfield inn Key West. What a great experience. The Fairfield was very clean and appeared to be recently remodeled. The pool was a great place to kick back and relax before heading down to Duval to be with the crazies. The breakfast was better than most places with a great selection. Starting off the day sitting outside having our first cup of coffee poolside was the best. Most of all the Staff was very sincere about our helping us out and could not do enough to make sure we had a great stay day. They succeeded!",
            "We recently visited Key West for a wedding and chose the Fairfield because it carries the Marriott name and had a great rate. We were not disappointed! The rooms were clean, comfortable and the beds ideal for a good night's sleep. The grounds and pool area were extremely clean and well kept. The pool is fantastic and being able to enjoy a complimentary breakfast out there each morning was wonderful. They have a special server named Mirella who took great care of us every day we were there! She is one of the best service industry employees I have encountered in a long time!! The hotel ia close enough to downtown Key West, but without the noise or crowds. It's a quick drive to Duval, where you can find whatever you might want to do. Overall, property was a great value for the price! A few negatives (which were greatly outweighed by positives): Rooms do not have mini-refrigerators (bring a cooler! ); the doors are heavy, hurricane style and slam loudly; and on the back side of the building lives a rooster who will let you know when it's dawn. (If your A/C is on, you probably won't ever hear him though.)",
            "The room was fairly small, not a suite room. The bathroom had an interesting smell. The rooms are loud. You can hear the people in the adjacent room and if anyone is rolling a suit case down the walk, you will hear it. The staff were extremely friendly which is why I would recommend staying here. It is not typical to spend the whole amount of time in your room on vacation, so as long as it is a place to stay, it is worth it. I was able to book last minute with them and it was worth the trip. It does require a taxi to get downtown, but old charter row is a short walk away. For the fisher, it is a great place to be.",
            "We almost always stay at Marriott hotels and when we saw the Fairfield Inn and Suites in Key West was a category 5, we made a reservation for two nights. The staff was really great and helpful but the hotel itself was not quite as modern as we expected. One advantage it did have was being a stop on the Old Town Trolley so it was easy to get around but I think next time we would stay closer to downtown. Loved Key West!",
            "Not impressed with the front desk staff at all- they could not have cared less. No welcome package or thank you to Marriott reward holders. Room was spacious, bed comfortable, but the noise level when you are facing the pool late in the night was bothersome. Gusts making loud noises late into the night did not make for a restful sleep. The bathroom was not clean at all. Glad I was only staying one night, sorry I had to use up all those points. After unpacking went to the bar area and then the front desk to get a few glasses- they do not exist on the property. What a shame, who wants to drink good bourbon out of Styrofoam. The best part was the bicycle rental kiosk on the property. The gentleman there was kind and efficient. Rental price inexpensive, bike functioned and with a basket and lock- everything you need for the 2 mile hike into town for the day.",
            "If you are going to Key West, stay here! Great pool area and breakfast area. The breakfast area is all open and around the pool area. Beautiful pool area! Plenty of chairs to lay around in and the pool is large enough so you have plenty of room even with a large number of guests. Rooms are very, very small and have very minimal decor/furnishings (the only negative) but the pool area makes this hotel worth it. We have stayed here several times. Only had one bad experience and that was because it was biker week. Since the parking is directly under the rooms, it was Very loud espcially from 12-3 am. We are just more cautious about when we go to the Keys! We will stay at this location every visit.",
            "Our room was small but very nicely appointed. The hotel itself was very attractive and the staff was welcoming and helpful. Sitting by the pool with its tropical garden, relaxing while having breakfast or an evening drink was great. The location was good and the price reasonable for Key West.",
            "If you're looking for somewhere to stay at Key West, you'll probably experience sticker shock. I never found anything \"cheap\" that looked appealing enough for me to stay in it. The Fairfield was by far the best value. It has free parking (a big deal in Key West), an awesome pool, and the best free continental breakfast I've ever seen. The staff is extremely friendly as well. The rooms are small but appear recently redone, and I loved the tiled shower. The hotel is a short drive from all the main attractions in Key West, I believe one of the trolley companies also picks up in the parking lot. This is a great value and nice place to stay during your trip to Key West.",
            "The grounds are beautiful, and the staff is excellent. Continental breakfast was great. There is free parking though it is too far to walk to the beaches and Duval St. from the hotel. However, nothing else was good about the hotel. The rooms are very small. Our room smelled strongly of mildew. The rooms need much better housekeeping and a thorough cleaning. The hotel is on a main thoroughfare and rather noisy at night with cars, scooters, motorcycles passing through. The uncomfortable beds creaked and squeaked. This is by far the worst Fairfield Inn, we have stayed at.",
            "We were very positively surprised by our stay at The Fairfield Inn in Key West--the staff greeted us warmly, provided useful discount coupons for several restaurants in town and were genuinely pleasant to deal with for the 3 days we stayed--including extending our checkout on a very popular weekend. The hotel is remodeled and the rooms are very adequate, the breakfast included in the room rate provided was really quite good with a broad assortment of food. The fitness room had relatively new equipment. The pool is really quite amazing. It is located within 5-7 minutes of Duval Street. Unlike some other reviews, we found that it was quiet and did not encounter any road noise. The free wifi worked quite well.",
            "Overall this hotel was like staying at a motel 6. The room was so small I felt like the walls were closing in on me. The room also needed some heavy duty cleaning there was dust on the walls so thick that when the air conditioning was on the dust would blow everywhere. In the shower there was dirt in the corners yuck! We ended up checking out early because it did not feel like a safe place to stay with our family.",
            "I stayed here with a friend using points. It's the closet of the Marriott hotels to Duval street at about 2 miles away. This hotel does not offer a free shuttle like the other Marriott properties, although it's only about a $10 cab ride down to Duval St. However, it does have a free continental breakfast. The hotel is on N Roosevelt Blvd, which is one of the main roads on the island. The area that it is in is a very commercial area (fast food restaurants, car dealerships, strip malls) but it seems like that is true for most of the chain hotels in Key West. We had a room with two doubles, facing the pool. All rooms appeared to have exterior entrances on the pool side and none appeared to have a personal balcony, just the exterior walkways. The appearance of the room was nice and modern, but the doubles are somewhat small, suites are certainly better. As with all Marriott hotels, the rooms were very clean and the staff were very friendly. The nicest thing about this hotel was its pool area. It was much nicer than I would expect for a Fairfield Inn. There was also an outdoor bar by the pool, I think it stayed open til 7pm. There were a few food/snack options at the bar, but it was mostly there for drinks. If I have the opportunity to stay in Key West again, I would certainly consider this hotel. However, I would likely choose the Courtyard for the free shuttle and slightly nicer rooms.",
            "Booked a standard room, but could fortunately get a suite. The suites are great! Nice large bed, clean, separate desk and fridge. The standard rooms are very small and do not have any room to store luggage. Very friendly staff at the front desk. Coffee, soda, cookies all for free at the reception area. Great pool and okay gym. Lots of parking space. Just 5 minutes to the old town. Close to shopping and restaurant area's.",
            "Nice tiles, fresh linen, and clean room. Safe environment. Beautiful pool. Knowledgeable staff helped us get around the island. Don't miss Mallory Square Sunset Celebration and the restaurants on Duval St., many do not accept American Express.Try the sunset catamaran and duo para-sailing. Had a great time! Noisy A/C but would stay again.",
            "My husband and I did not know what to expect as we had not been to Key West before. This hotel was the cheapest of the chains hotels and we really weren't sure about the accomodations. We were greated by smiling, friendly staff - including the hotel manager - who immediately gave us a drink and mardi gras beads. We found that we had been upgraded to a suite - it was pretty sweet! The pool is georgeous with fountains spraying into the pool (which is heated :o) it made a swim perfect as it was a little chilly out). The room was very nice for the price. These are not 5 star accomodations, but they are the best for the price that you pay. We were able to park under the lights both nights we were there. We would definitely stay here again.",
            "Our previous hotel offering was a serious disappointment. I booked this in a pinch. Arrived about a half hour after booking. They had all my info ready to go. Check in took all of 3 minutes. The girls were very friendly. Our room was over top of where we parked which was great because we were on a motorcycle. Our room was spotless! A/C was set so the room was cool and comfortable when walking in and not a wall of hot stale air. Bathroom was immaculate as was toilet and sink. Bed was comfortable. Linens were clean. Hotel staff was good about calling a taxi for us. Continental breakfast was okay in the mornings. Could have been better but hey, it was no extra charge! Scooter rental guy was a doll. Gave us a deal and we saved about $70 on two scooters for 8 hours. Gave a complete demonstration about operation of the scooters. Pool area was awesome! Lots of seating areas, chairs, towels, etc. Pool was clean. Pool cleaner guy was there at night taking care of pool. Bar was ok. Drinks were over priced....small plastic cup size frozen drink approx 8oz was $8.",
            "We stay at Marriotts around the world but never in Key West. So we thought that we would take a chance on this hotel. What a great find. It is located right outside the downtown noise and traffic. Easy to get to all things in \"Key West\". The trolley stopped right in front of the door so we coud leave our car parked. The rooms are bright and ariy and they have the most spectacular pool with a BAR right beside the pool. Having a short swim and a great tropical drink in the sun was a bonus we did not expect. Love this hotel.",
            "Rooms nothing special; not very spacious and \"weird\" bathroom. Nice breakfast buffet with a lot of different choices (only one type of tea, though). Good location. Friendly staff. We asked for a quiet room when booking online and we probably got the most quiet room at the hotel.",
            "You get what you pay for! The A/C unit in our hotel room was so loud that we did not get one good nights sleep during our 3 night stay. It sounded like a jet plane taking off every time it kicked on. The bed was very squeaky. The pool was nice, but we did not use it. The breakfast was decent, only because it was free. Had standard continental breakfast items. Now, the biggest complaint........we had a problem with our bill and the Operations Manager, Jeff Emmett, was far from helpful and really needs to be trained in customer service. We had inquired about using a rewards certificate prior to our stay and we were told no problem. When it did not show up on our bill we went to the front desk and we were put into contact with Mr. Emmet. He was very short, told us that there was nothing that he could do, and further told us that there was no one in Marriott that we could call. Finally, he gave us a number to call. The Marriott customer service rep. was very nice and helpful. She asked me to put Mr. Emmett on the phone. He proceeded to argue with her telling her that there was nothing that he can do and and ended up hanging up on her (remember this was a fellow Marriott employee). He ended up fixing it for us, even though earlier he told us that there was not anything that he could do. We are very loyal Marriott customers and timeshare owners and this is not the kind of service that we are used to from Marriott. If this is a franchise, it is no way to represent the \"Marriott\" name.",
            "This hotel is great. I stayed at the Casa Marina as well during my vacation and in terms of overall value, the Fairfield comes out top every time. The team at the front desk (Ildi, Nora, Kelly and Natalie) were simply awesome, recommending some wonderful trips, they were very friendly and always smiling. They made us feel welcome every time we entered the lobby area and they always called us by our names after we checked in. They are a great bunch of people. The free breakfast, parking and coffee and juice in the lobby just shows how this hotel is different from others In Key West - no rip extra charges. The pool area is fantastic and the rooms are always clean and adequate in terms of size. Thanks for helping us to enjoy our stay and have a great vacation. We will be back",
            "My family and I stayed at the Fairfield Inn for one night last week. The pool and breakfast areas are certainly beautiful. The older rooms, which I was told were \"gutted and redone\", are still lacking. The door jamb was missing on the first room we were in so the noise from street traffic was unbelievable. The staff were very kind and moved us to a room toward the back. The noise from traffic was less but, the noise from the air conditioner kept us up most of the night. Try to get a suite in the new section of the hotel if booking at this location.",
            "This Feb of 2008 my wife and I stayed with the Marriot Fairfield Inn and Suites. We had a wonderful time! Checking in was a breeze with the very courtious and respectful staff assisting us with our bags and the introduction to the islands offerings. The staff were able to help us with our planning of trips throughout the three days we stayed, they assisted us with our transportation needs, sunset cruises, and most importantly our resturant choices. Getting around the island, we though would be troublesome, but the staff told us about the new scooter and bike rental company on property, directly next to the pool. We stopped in at the rental place called AHI Rentals and found the rates to be very pleasing to our wallets, we rented two scooters and never had to pay for a cab or any type of parking during our whole trip (saved us so much money and time) The hotel has a wonderful breakfast for a limited selection, jimmy dean sandwiches, bagels, coffee and juices, fruits and cereals. Oh, and the pool! such a wonderful and enjoyable area around the compound. We found the rooms to be very cozy, the beds were comfortable for being away from our own bed at home, and the housekeeping cleaned everything. Checking out was also a so very simple. Under our door was our bill early in the morning. We did not even have to step into the lobby before leaving. High recommendation for the hotel and staff! Thank you very much",
            "I work for a different hotel chain and have pretty high standards! I could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Fairfield Inn & Suites Key West! The service was wonderful. The lady who was at the front desk most of the time (she was from Hungry) remembered us and was awsome! She accomodated all of our requests. Our room was wonderful. The pool was always great, clean and relaxed. Pete was was always at the Tiki bar to help us out. On our 1st night he recognized that we were \"new\" and asked for our ID\"s ... after that, he knew us by face! The breakfast was adequate and service still great as well! We did have to take a Taxi from the hotel to downtown, however met some great people with wonderful info as a result (Hi Ben from Israel!!). All in all I'd stay here again and give this hotel 2 thumbs up!! Great job! !",
            "Almost all of Key West's lodgings are overpriced, so paying $137/night (including taxes) for an average motel/hotel room at the roadside Fairfield is not too bad. But the slightly worn-out rooms are not even as large as at a typical Best Western -- they also lack closets, and the furniture in ours was pretty rickety. Not many electrical outlets either. On the plus side, wi-fi, breakfast and parking are all free. The staff are really A+. From the friendly check-in clerks to the efficient housekeeping and maintenance, everyone who works here seems to genuinely care about guests enjoying their stay. Hurrah!",
            "The Fairfield was overall a great hotel. I wish it was closer to all of the main attractions like Duval Street or the beaches. It got pricy to take cabs everywhere. The rooms are a bit small so definitely get a suite if you have more than 2 people. The pool area and tiki bar are fabulous with drink specials everyday. They have a nice business center in the lobby. The hallways are all outside and the rooms are detached from the lobby so the elevator was kind of far to drag the luggage to. I would stay here again only if I was looking to only relax by a pool. If you want to go to a beach or enjoy the nightlife, definitely stay somewhere closer to those areas.",
            "What a fantastic staff. Don & Lindsey were life savers along with Jeff Emmett. My daughters trip would have been ruined not to mention in an unsafe situation if these folks had not gone out of their way to help me. I will always be grateful.",
            "I really cant say too much about this place other than it is average. I think its easier to do a review in list format: Pro: -Reasonably priced - we paid $159 (without tax) on Jan 2, compared to $3-400 for the rest of Key West -Our check-in staff Andrea was super great and helpful. -Decent location - on the main highway right next to plenty of shopping. 5 minute drive to anywhere in Key West. Is right across from the harbor, so can walk across the highway and have a nice place to sit and watch. -Nice heated pool Neutral: -Breakfast was decent. Typical Fairfield Inn breakfast (however, gotta complain about the plates being so small - can you please supply plates that are at least the size of the waffles?) -Hotel is painted nicely. However, it really shows its age. Con: -Rooms are tiny! We stayed in a King Suite and the bedroom had little room for our luggage. We put the luggage in the living room\" to be able to walk around the bedroom. -Mattresses are horrible! They are probably 10 years old? Every time my wife or I would move on the bed, it would squeak loudly. -Staff outside of lobby are not overly friendly. Seem too much in a hurry to even return my hello... -Seriously, can you please provide coffee throughout the day? Your staff is tired of coming up with excuses on why some days you have coffee in the lobby and others you dont. Im sure its a cost cutting measure, and some staff do go out of their way to help more than others, but get rid of the coffee makers in the room if that will bring back 24 hour coffee in the lobby. I would recommend this hotel to anyone mainly due to the value. If you have money to burn, stay closer to Duval Street. There are several nice inns down there, but they are pricey!",
            "we arrived late in the evening and had problems finding a room... Mariott was fully booked but for one king... and Courtyard had no vacancy... so we checked in into a 2 queen family room. High season and high demand probably and being in Key West justified the 200 USD. Rooms off the mainroad are alright, but the AC noise is unbearable.. Negative: No wardrobe, a couple of hangers in the corner next to the washingbasin Negative: Curtain next to washbasin is merely hiding the pseudowardrobe and cannot be drwan, so no privacy. Negative: Room to small if suitcases have to lay, stand about the room. Difficult: Not well postsigned and difficult to find, evenings or nights Breakfast was included, basic but ok. We did not use pool, so no comment. Positive: Staff very friendly and helpful, no matter what time of day or night Positive: Free use of Computers in Lobby Positive: Nice Lobby Positive: Plenty of breakfast tables in the shade or in the open sun",
            "-Visibility/Recognition from road needs to be better. Fairfiled sign in between 2 palm trees - I saw it the day I left. Another sign was obstructed by current construction items. I drove by twice looking for the motel. -Pool Area is beautiful. -Tables for breakfast needed to be wiped off initially and between uses - black film on the table i sat at -My room floor had a black film on surface. When I got in bed my feet bottoms were black. I took a tissue and wiped the floor - black. I asked the desk clerk the next morjning to be sure my room floor was mopped. It was. -Other than the floor, my room was fine. -Staff was helpful. accomodating and delightful. -Good location-, good access.",
            "I travel to Key West regularly for work and always stay at the Fairfield Inn. It's a great hotel....good location, decent-sized rooms, delicious breakfast and an amazing staff. Nick, the sales manager, always tries to get me the best rates. In addition, everyone at the front desk is always helpful and there to greet you with a smile, especially Beata - she is extremely helpful and was able to quickly resolve booking issues i had the last time i checked-in. I totally recommend this hotel when you are in Key West either for business or pleasure!",
            "Stayed for one night on a drop in and was a little shocked at the size and quality of the rooms. Marriott is my preferred chain and never disappoints... except this time. Nice friendly staff all around and good service. Nice grounds and decent pool. We did find ants around the sink in room 111 which was off putting. I wouldn't have minded sharing the room with them if we had had a bit more space. First time I have stayed at a Marriott that was so small and dated.",
            "We took a 2 night 3 day vacation and stayed at the Fairfield Inn in January 2012. We travel a lot and really were impressed with how friendly the staff was and how bright and clean the property was. The pool was big with a lot of lounge chairs. This continental breakfast was amazing with so many wonderful choices . We especially enjoyed the healthy options of fresh fruit,yogurt,and hard boiled eggs.",
            "We had an excellent experience at your Key West location. The staff was superb especially Olivia who provided the absolute best locations on the island to have great food and drink. This included helping us with reservations on a sunset cruise that we will remember for a life time. This was a long awaited vacation and even with the rain we had for the first 4 days we had an excellent time with the help of your friendly and curteous staff. They kept us smiling throughout.",
            "Picked the Fairfield Inn mainly for their reputation and the rate. Turned out that it's about 2 miles from most of the downtown attractions (Duval St.). There are several buildings that make-up the property. The front buildings seem new, but the back two buildings have the look of an old 1950's motel that has been repainted and remodeled. We stayed in a room in one of these buildings -- very small room. I mean VERY small. However, it was clean. The \"courtyard\" pool was also nice, and seemed new. The \"tiki bar\" left something to be desired -- especially the bartender. He seemed a little bothered most of the time, and didn't seem to enjoy his position. Would've also been nice to have a waitress circling the pool, taking drink orders. Parking was OK at the hotel, but it's lack of proximity to Duval St. meant driving downtown and paying at least $10 per night to park there. Breakfast was normal Fairfield Inn fare. Price was right -- just nothing special about it. Not a bad place to stay though, even with some of the issues mentioned here.",
            "I've been at all three of the Key West Marriott Hotels and this is my favorite for value and relaxation. Has a great relaxing pool layout, full continental+ breakfast and on this last visit a staff which worked harder than most travel agents finding some last minute activities and making the bookings for our family.",
            "The hotel and staff were perfect for our weekend getaway. It was quiet, charming. We were celebrating my 50th birthday. We loved Key West. Great place to get away and have fun! The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our room was perfect and clean. Nice comfortable bed and amenities! We will definetely stay at the Fairfield Inn when we return to Key West!",
            "We choose the Fairfield Inn for our stay because it was a lower price than the Duval street hotels. While the hotel is not new - (the room was small)- it has been renovated. Our room was clean, the bathroom was clean. The hotel lobby was nice and bright. The pool was beautiful and heated. Each morning the continental breakfast had cereal, muffins, fruit, breakfast sandwiches you could heat and the make your own waffles. The staff was friendly and accommodating. My only disappointment was that our room did not have a small refrigerator. After eating so many wonderful meals it was sad not to be able to take a go box. Also their bar closed at 7 pm. I was pleasantly surprised that we felt safe walking to Duval street and back later in the evening. Be aware that it is a full two mile walk- 1/2 hour at a good clip. There are scooters and bikes to rent at the hotel.",
            "The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. We had a one bedroom suite which was sufficiently roomy. The bed and the sofa both rated about 5 on a 1 to 10 comfort index. Bathroom was spacious. Internet service was excellent. The room and the property were clean and the pool area is very attractive. Parking is free with some covered parking. The free breakfast is typical Fairfield and is served in an open patio area. This hotel is not within easy walking distance of any restaurants or attractions.",
            "Very nice property however the pictures on the website was a bit misleading as it gave the impression that the King Suite was much larger than the actual size. We got an end unit which the view from the suite was the concrete wall of the walk way.even when you open the shutters the lighting was poor. The manager Chris, should take a refresher course in guest relations as he was not very tactful in advising me at check that there was no AARP /AAA or Travel Agents rate available. He chose to yell this out very loudly in his response and within ear shot of the other guest who were waiting to check in. He also barked at me that the hotel was FULL. As a Marriott member and a Guest I was really appalled by his demeanor and tone. I will continue to book other hotels in the Marriott chain however not this location.",
            "Over the last couple years the maintenance and cleaning crew has been slacking. The pool area used to be pristine, now the paver stones are dirty and downright ugly. The landscaping is not being maintained. It is overgrown is some places, dead in others. The outside of the buildings have mold and mildew on them. It needs a good cleaning, which in FL all buildings require a couple times per year. It is a smoke free hotel, but guests tend to sneak smokes in stairwells and in the under building parking, staff does not police this. The interior of the rooms is getting worn down, need a remodel. Overall they keep them up fairly well, some mold and mildew in the shower stalls, the floors are clean, as well as the bathroom counters, sink and toilets. Towels have gotten downright cheap, used to be thin, now they are almost see through. The free breakfast is a plus, especially the staff that works to provide it, they are always helpful and keep the area as clean as they can.",
            "After we checked in we went to rent scooters from the onsite rental agent (separate business from the hotel). When we went to pay for the deposit on the scooter, to our amazement, our Debit card was declined. This only happens when our spending limit is increased for the day or more obvious we are out of money. Neither of these should have been the case because our room was prepaid months ago. So we had to pay $200 in cash for the deposit on the scooter. Upon further investigation the hotel mistaking charged us again for the hotel stay. We informed them of their error and they said they would credit the card. The problem is now our card is locked and we are left only with cash. I spent an outrageous amount of time talking to both the Hotel and my bank to clear up this error. It was not the way I wanted to spend the first day of my vacation. I talked to 4-5 people at the hotel and 2-3 people at my bank before it was finally resolved. VERY AGGRAVATING. 6 HOUR ORDEAL. The other very aggravating issue was the location of the ice machine. There is only one for the entire complex. It is located in the far back corner above the parking garage. It can only be accessed by stairs unless you are lucky enough to be located on the far wing of the complex. It's mind boggling that the Marriott would have only one ice machine for a complex of this size. The Hotel is located on a very busy, fast moving street that is noisy all time of the day and night. The pool area is very nice and large with several water features. The bar is located very close and is also nice. The shower was large and had very good water pressure. The hot water was nice and hot. Only one mirror in the room. This became a major inconvenience when we tried to get ready go in the A.M and P.M. The grounds were clean and well maintained. I would not return here.",
            "We chose this hotel because it was reasonably priced and was walking distance to the marina we were going out of for Kiteboarding lessons every day. It is about a mile north of most of the main attractions and beaches of Key West. Conveniently there are bikes available to rent on site at a good rate. The breakfast in the morning is very nice: Good selection, great environment by the pool, complementary newspaper, and amazingly friendly staff. The pool area is very nice. Free WiFi. Restaurants, drug stores, and grocery stores are within walking distance. If you are looking for the Key West experience and are on a budget this is perfect. Definitely get what you pay for!",
            "Spent the night here in Feb 2010. The hotel was what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect to find at other Fairfield Inns. Parking/check in/pool all were fine. Continental breakfast was standard. Suite for 4 people was adequate. We had a king size bed which was nice. The kids used the fold out in a separate room (with TV). Water pressure was good. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear the highway from out location behind the pool. All tourist attractions in Key West are a good 10 min drive from the Fairfield. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ok with that then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine place to stay. A few days here would be good here but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down for a week, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d look for a place with more amenities.",
            "I love the laid back feel of the Keys! I have stayed in this hotel once before and loved it. So when I decided to plan a friends get together, I thought that the Fairfield in Key West was perfect. The staff is so hospitable, and the hotel was very reasonably priced and a good location. We had a good time at the pool and the bar is great. Everything was perfect, especially the yummy breakfast...I can't wait to go back next year!",
            "Like others have said, the room is small, but for two normal size people, it's fine. Not recommended if you are 250 pounds + and require major room just to move around. My guess is that the people who make comments about the size of the hotel rooms are carrying a few extra pounds. The bathroom was very nice, very updated. In fact, the bathroom and shower are the nicest part of the room. If you are wondering about the walk to Duval Street, it does take some time. My friend and I are pretty fast walkers and in shape, but it probably took us @ 40 minutes to get down there. Don't walk all the way down Hwy 1 to Duval. Start on Hwy 1 then take a right on Palm Avenue then follow Eaton Street. It ends on Duval where all the action is. It's a big difference in time. But even this \"angle\" was still 40 minutes. Ask the hotel staff if unclear.",
            "Being a Platinum Rewards member gets you 200 points at checkin, and that is it. We just came from Doral to visit for a few days in Key West, the other Marriotts here were sold out... courtyard and beachside. The reviews from earlier on the location and staff had me optimistic that there might be bright lights. Yes, the staff are welcoming. No upgrades here due to high occupancy in winter. Basic rooms, no frills. Bring your own soaps n shampoo is you are expecting high end products. This is not the Napa Fairfield if you have ben there, you know what I mean. No no, this is much more basic. We paid $187/night, free parking, free wifi, second floor in building with no elevators, view of pool king bed and pull out sofa. No patio. Free breakfast, Marriott inn usual. Sink could use renovation. Glass shower with tile. Atleast tv was flat panel. Sofa needs to be thrown out. Mattress needs to be replaced. It is a basic fairfield inn. The price is standard for winter in Key west. There is laundry and bike rentals on site. The staff here try their best to do what thy can with what there is. If you need perks and newer accomodations, this is not it. It is the Keys, go have a drink and relax.",
            "We really liked this hotel, nice swimming-pool area, very nice staff !! The only complain it's the noise of the street (Rosevelt Blvd), very noisy at night ! but anyway not a fault from the hotel. Free parking, no hidden extra charge, they gave us a second cocktail for free at the swimming-pool bar. The breakfast was simple but quality was there, you can make yourself some waffles.",
            "I am lifetime platinum with Marriott and booked my room on reward points. The hotel has a lot going for it. Great staff....one of the friendliest and most helpful anywhere. There's also a large, clean, pool situated in very inviting surroundings. Another plus is an above-average complimentary breakfast buffet served poolside. In the afternoon, the breakfast area adjoining turns into a fun and friendly Tiki Bar....also very nice. Location is about a 5-10 minute drive from Duval Street shopping, dining, and nightlife. (Cabs are fairly plentiful and relatively cheap), The only problem here during my stay was the room. Clean, bright, and equipped with comfy bedding, but very small. We had three people (me, wife, and young adult son), and we kept bumping into each other. Very little storage space for luggage, etc. I did notice that they had what appeared to be larger rooms and suites. So my advice would be to book one of those (and expect to pay a little more), unless you're traveling solo, not planning spending time in the room (this IS Key West), or otherwise don't mind having limited space.",
            "This place has clean, well maintained small rooms and a fabulous pool. They have a decent free breakfast each morning too. Unless you like a good 40 minute walk downtown you probably want to drive or get a cab to Duval or the marina. We did the walk and it wasn't bad at all; even in the heat. This is a solid choice and I would definitely go back again. Nothing fancy, but clean, and a great pool. What else do you need in Key West?",
            "I must say, almost as great as the comforts of your own home. Being that this was my first time to The Keys, I thought I would be disappointed not being right there in the center of all the action on Duval Street. Wow, I'm glad I wasn't in the middle of the action. If I choose to go back to The Keys, Fairfield Inn would be my choice of hotel.",
            "If you book rooms at name brand hotels because you don't want surprises when you arrive, look somewhere else. Although the main building appears to be relatively new construction - as you might expect if you've stayed in Fairfield Inns in the past - most of the rooms here are in much older buildings that had obviously been built long before Marriott took over. Although the room was clean, it was extremely small and not very well appointed. The pool area was nice but the parking area (most of it under the guest rooms on the exposed first floor) filled up quickly. Everything had a new coat of paint, but the place just had a tired, run-down feel to it. I will say, the staff were wonderful and because of them I have to give the hotel an overall \"Average\" rating. If this hotel was on a small Caribbean island it would be a gem, but in Key West I think I could have done better.",
            "This hotel had one handicap parking spot out front, and only one entrance with a ramp to the rooms/pool area. To make someone in a wheelchair go from one end of the resort to another in order to reach a ramp is just not acceptable these days. I paid $60 more at this hotel than my hotel on Duval Street which offered an amazing cooked to order breakfast and great accessibility. The breakfast was far from good at Fairfield, and the workers were annoying trying to sell excurisions. I will definitely plan in advance to not have to stay with Fairfield again.",
            "We chose this location because we were trying to stay out of the excitement, as we had our kids with us. The hotel is about two miles from Duval Street and the sunset at Mallory Square, which is a very easy ride. The facility was very nice, especially as compared to other Fairfield Inns. The pool was beautiful, with nice fountains and a great outdoor bar, and the bartender Mike was a super guy. The lobby was very classy, and the free breakfast offered more choices than most similar places. The rooms looked fresh and were clean. We actually used Marriott points for this one - so the room was free, and I'm not sure what the price would have been. We did not do it, but I would have felt safe leaving the kids in the room and hitting the town for a few hours at night time.",
            "warm welcome;great poolside bar, great pool;nice room, clean everything; nice free breakfst buffett poolside; and the bonus not expected? They have Moped rental at the activity desk, and Mopeds on hand and ready to go. We got 2 and they were nice, new, and pretty reasonable.",
            "VERY SMALL room: not up to marriott standards. Had to cahnge rooms because the ceiling was falling down, hair in the towels, and a large wad of hair in the room hair dryer. The shower had mol d spots in the ceiling and the shower tile was so slippery that it was a hazard to take a shower, must have used VERY unskilled labor as the sharp corners of the tile proturded in the shower and tile that was away from the wall and no grouted was full of gunk. Extremely disappointed in the room, although the help was very nice as was the outdoor area.",
            "This hotel was not far from downtown and activities - about two km from Duval Street. Pool and room were beautiful. The bed was very comfortable. Continental breakfast was very good. Staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was next to US, which made it quite noisy at times. I would definitely stay at the Fairfield again and recommend it as well.",
            "My boyfriend and I chose to stay here for his brothers wedding this past weekend. The main reason is because we got a free night with points. We stayed four nights in a king room. It was nice but we were a little disappointed because the room was a lot smaller than we thought it was going to be. I recommend upgrading to the king suite to give yourself more room. The shower was really nice and the room was clean. The bed was comfortable also. We also very much enjoyed the pool. Big, clean, and cheap drinks from the tiki bar. The major downside was that it was so loud every morning and hard to sleep in. We heard the same noises every morning. Housekeeping going up and down the hallway and banging around and the roosters around constantly crowing. The AC in our room was very loud as well. I'm not sure if I would stay here again but would recommend it if noises don't bother you.",
            "Great hotel, great location, nice and quite. Our room was small but even with that, the room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel pool was very nice - I don't think I have ever seen a Fairfield Inn with a pool that large and fancy. The free breakfast was excellent and a great bargin. Also, the staff was outstanding... very friendly and helpful with everything (from check-in to local sights). We would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend this hotel.",
            "we stayed at this hotel Nov 4-6th and had no problems. From the time I walked into the Lobby (greeted with a cup of juice) to the time of checkout the staff was friendly, helpful and always smiling. The continental breakfasts here were wonderful. Huge variety of choices and fresh selections. Pool area was great for our family (traveling with 5 year old and 2 year old). Room was huge but it was big enough and very clean and comfortable. We had a room away from the street so I can't complain about noise. Honestly for the money this was a fantastic hotel and would definitely recommend and choose it again in the future. If you are looking to be on Duval street you need to drive or taxi cab. However, we had children so it wasn't our top priority to stay out late and be in the heart of the action.",
            "We usually do not like to stay any hotel having doors opened to outside. We did not realize it until we got over there. But we decided to give it a try. The staff was very nice, and updated our room to 2-room suite for free. Free Internet and free breakfast were also available. The tour bus stops in front of the hotel, and you may ask the receptionist for more information. She also helped us to book tickets to Dry Tortugas National park. The pool is a very beautiful one.",
            "far from duval street and no free shuttle despite the marriot courtyard up the road providing one. pool is nice and breakfaast assortment was better than anticipated. i suspect we were in the older part of the hotel with a double room. it was clean but window opened to walkway so no privacy and room was tiny, no desk etc. we were originally going to stay 2 nights but at $359/night, no way. we were abe to get a special rate at the casa marina resort for $379/night with a $100 credit for resort acgtivities etc and it included a complete breakfast buffet. Maybe a studio suite at this hotel could barey justify their price but certainly not a room on par with a Days Inn",
            "This hotel served a wonderful free hot and cold breakfast. Plenty of free parking, some covered. The pool is HUGE! The regular room was so small that our family of 4 could barely walk around. The regular room did NOT have micro or fridge. The beds were FULL, not queen, and there was barely room for the 2 beds. We are platinum elite with Marriott so we asked to be upgraded to a suite as soon as possible and 2 days later we got a suite for no charge. The suites were 2 room; large and spacious. A spacious living with a sleeper couch, fridge, microwave, table, 2 chairs, business desk, and desk chair. In addition there was a lounge chair and a coffee table. The TV was flat panel. There could have been more channels. In the bedroom, the beds were clean and comfortable but a little soft for my back. The bath was very small with a modern tiled shower- no tub. The bedroom is separated from the living by a glass, curtained, locking door. The windows did not open and did not have curtains. They did have nice shutters.",
            "The hotel isn't located in the 'main strip' BUT it is within easy walking distance - a nice leisurely (and safe) walk (or if you're not inclined then a cheap taxi ride). The staff are great, even assisting in booking our day trip to Dry Tortugas (Fort Jefferson); a MUST do.",
            "Room was clean, liked the separation of toilet/glass shower and the sink. Thank you! Breakfast was a pleasant surprise with lots of options. Pool area was nice with well-kept landscaping. Rent a bike (I recommend Eaton closer to downtown - they have lights) and enjoy the ride into town - cheaper than taxi's in the end and not too long of a ride. Be sure to have a light on your bike since it's illegal not to after dark.",
            "Management and staff were very pleasant and helpful. However, the building is old, rooms are small and dark, A/C is too loud to keep on at night, walls are thin, walkways run along outside all the rooms hence much pedestrian noise, hotel is situated very close to highway US1 and thus noisy, room towels should have been replaced many years ago!!!! I would not stay here again.",
            "Jimmy Buffett might have stayed here, and he would have easily found that lost shaker of salt in these very small (RV sized) rooms! So small that you could easily pole vault from the beds to the bath and back in a single attempt (I did not attempt it) The room had plantation shutters and no drapes so we enjoyed ambient LED lighting from outside all night. In the finest highway gas station rest room tradition the sink had neglected to have a drain stopper, a bow to water conservation or whatever, The toilet had an interesting sign on the lid proudly proclaiming its inefficiency with high contents. All this for ONLY $279 per night!. Staff were great, however. Breakfast good as well. Think small, stay here!",
            "Great service, very nice rooms, (outdoor entrance to rooms) beautiful & very large pool surrounded by palm trees & shrubs so it's somewhat secluded from view. Very nice breakfast next to the pool. Only down side is it's located on a very busy/noisy highway ( the main highway in & out of Key West) & is about 2 miles from downtown Key West. I think almost all of the rooms are set back off the highway far enough to keep the noise to a minimum & also the rooms have a continuos fan option on the air conditoning system to muffle any highway noise. A good choice would be a room set back as far as possible from the highway but still overlooking the pool. The Old Town Trolley is the way to go to get downtown. They stop every half-hour at The Fairfield & 11 other stops on the island between 9am & 4:30 pm. It costs about $29.00. (It was good for 2 days which may have been a special being offered while I was there.) You'll need to take a cab back to the hotel after trolley is done for the day (about $11.00) There is a grocery store & shopping center within walking distance. Overall a great hotel to stay at if you don't mind being 2 miles from downtown.",
            "I've stayed at the Fairfield previously and booked this trip for a retirement celebration with a family member. The staff made us feel like we were staying in a private home. They could not have been friendlier. Many staff members are from other countries but speak beauftiful english and told us charming stories of their countries. It was quite interesting. They told us they appreciated us speaking to them because it helped them learn about our country as well. Our car stayed parked at the Inn and we took local transportation to downtown Key West so we didn't have the hassle and worry of parking our car or driving in \"season\" traffic. The best way to travel. We could have rented bikes, but we took buses and taxis - cheap! GO! You'll love every minute!",
            "Don't understand rationale for Fairfield Inn custom of NOT placing water cups in the same room as the water tap! One arrives at room thirsty, finds a water tap in the bathroom but then finds that he/she needs to try to cup hands together to have a simple drink of water! Frustrated, the still thirsty traveler now starts a 'where are the cups\" hunt? Is there some logical reason why water cups should not be placed in the same room as the water source? Also puzzled at Fairfield's practice of NOT putting water cups in the same room as the water tap? The thirsty traveler arrives at the hotel, finds the water tap in the bathroom. but no cups!? The immediate alternative is to cup hands to drink! Or leave the bathroom and embark on a cup search elsewhere in the apartment! I am at a loss to guess the reason for thus incovenient strategy ?? ?",
            "While in Key West we prefer to stay at B&Bs near downtown, the Fairfield Inn & Suites is an acceptable alternative despite being more than two miles from Duval Street. My wife and I stayed there for three nights smack during high-priced, high-tourist season. The cost, however, was reasonable given the season. While Fairfields are in many respects average hotels, what sets this one apart is the knowledgeable, friendly staff. For instance, their recommendations of restaurants and attractions were terrific. They were most accommodating in every respect. In fact, they sought out their guests to be sure they were comfortable and had everything they needed. Our room was small but clean and stocked with all the amenities we would need. The AC was noisy when it came on. The pool area was of a quality one would expect at a four-star hotel. The outside bar and adjacent continental breakfast area spacious. All in all, if we couldn't be closer to the action downtown, the Fairfield did nicely.",
            "We drove in looking for a room with no reservation on christmas eve.a lil pricier then I wanted but was worth it! Great pool and tiki bar.excellent continental breakfast.staff was accommodating and patient with my kids.doesn't look like anything from the front but a great place to stay.it is away from the square though.but was still worth it!",
            "first of all. hotel prices are high in Key West in general. You can compare it to New York. The location of this hotel is next to the main road and that causes a considerable amount of noise. Staff was generally friendly despite the fact that the manager started an argument with us in the lobby. for our part the whole thing with giving out discount coupons for places to drink (buy one drink, get one for free) reminded us of party-charter-tourism to Ibiza, and takes away the exotic experinence of going to Key West. It underlined that if you want to see something enjoyable in Key West you better be drunk, which is not the fact at all. Key West is a place to visit no doubt. Lots of stuff to do, and plenty of amazing restaurants offering high class seafood. The restaurant neither had a lactose nor a gluten free selection of food, and the breakfast reminded me of prior experiences at Holiday Express or Days Inn. There are plenty of hotels in Key West. This one would definitely not be my 1st choice for my next stay.",
            "Small rooms with extremely comfortable beds. Plenty of towels and the room was clean. Good free breakfast with plenty of selections. Free parking in the hotel yard. I can recommend staying here but remember it is pretty far from all the action in central Key West. You will need a car to go to the bach and downtown or take a taxiwherever you go. Not so many things within walking distance except for some shops and restaurants (like Friday\u00c2\u00b4s). One thing I did not like; We stayed on the 2nd floor. The railings had a note attached \"Please do not lean on railing\" and I felt like the railing could fall down any minute! This made me feel a bit unsafe when walking there with my 2 year old daughter. However I still feel I can recommed this hotel, staff was helpful and rooms comfortable.",
            "Friendly, helpful staff and nice clean rooms that include amenities like walk-in showers & mini-fridges plus the bed was extra comfy. Had a room that faced US 1 and it was a bit noisy, but not to the point of annoyance and it did not disturb our sleep. Lack of elevator in our wing made lugging the suitcases up and down the stairs a chore. This was only an inconvenience not worth getting upset over as the staff was more than willing to help. Breakfast included in the room and it was the typical \"Continental\" fare served in most hotels in the Fairfield class. The hotel's General Manager was on hand to greet guests and make sure they were taken well care of which was a nice touch. All-in-all, a very good value compared to the closer-in but much pricier alternatives. I would stay again.",
            "My husband and I stayed here for 5 days while vacationing in Key West. The room was really clean and well stocked. The pool is absolutely amazing, almost like you were staying at a resort. There were only two things I would change. The first thing is I would have loved a hot tub. The second thing, which was not the fault of the hotel, were the random roosters that wandered outside, making all kinds of noises in the early morning hours. However, the beautiful tiling and awesome bathroom made up for those two things! We will definitely stay here again!",
            "Despite reading other reviews stating that the rooms were very small, we booked a suite for our 3 day stay in Key West. The property is off the beaten track and easily located. Our first impression was that we were not going to enjoy the Fairfield Inn. However, the building where you checkin was very nice and the desk clerks very helpful. The pool was very nice and the lobby inviting, so we figured that we would be OK. We were assigned a suite on the first floor. However, the first floor requires stairs/elevator--not good for persons with physical impairments. The Fairfield Inn has exterior corridors, which presents safety issues. Upon entering the unit, we were shocked at the cavelike atmosphere. Not only was the \"suite\" extremely small, but with very low ceilings and little light, it had a claustrophobic feeling. The bedroom was decent sized, with tile floors and a king bed. The bathroom was huge--especially considering how small the room was. The pie shaped \" living room\" had a sleeper sofa and built in refrig/microwave. The problem with this arrangement is safety. Not only is the sleeper sofa near the entrance, but right above it is a window on the exterior corridor, making it easy for child snatching . Also of concern is a fire issue---with the sleeper sofa opened, there is no way to walk around it in the event of a fire. Because of the safety issues, we checked out of the Fairfiled Inn . The desk clerk, Kelly, was very understanding and gracious and offered to move us. But because all of the rooms had exterior entrances, we chose to decline her offer.",
            "For my first trip to Key West we decided to stay at the Fairfield Inn and Suites - I was extremely disappointed in the rooms. I thought that they were exceptionally small. Our room was located near the elevator and we were kept awake most of the first night of our stay by everyone returning from the bar in the middle of the night. The next day we did relocate to a room along the back of the hotel - so our view was only of the parking lot but at least it was quiet. Pool area was great as was the breakfast but by Marriott standards - this was certaintly not a category 5 hotel. My next trip back to Key West in April was definitely not spent at the Fairfield.",
            "The Fairfield is a smart and well run hotel on the outskirts of Key West. It's easy to find on the main ring road into the City, but a little awkward due to there being a limited bus service and around 1.5miles from the main City centre. The Key West trolley tour makes a stop outside every 30min though, which is good if you're not into walking. Staff are very courteous and professional. Checking in and out a breeze. The lobby has free coffee (certain times only) and free internet. Free parking is also available to the rear of the hotel. Rooms are well appointed with large comfortable beds and a 'nautical' themed decor (to match the area you're staying in I guess!!). Air con was somewhat noisy and intrusive in both of our rooms, but worked well. The free breakfasts were ample and in a pleasant outdoor environment, and the pool deserves a mention as it's one of the best. All in all a pleasant hotel, a tad expensive and remote for the City, but fine for us.",
            "The front desk people were very helpful and friendly. I liked that our room had a tile floor and not carpeting. The bed was very comfortable and even though we brought our own pillows, we didn't need them because the pillows they had were fine. We also had extra towels and got bigger towels for the pool. Breakfast was more than adequate and the pool area was very enjoyable. We were only sorry that the pool didn't have a hot tub too.",
            "Our stay at the Fairfield was very pleasant. The front desk staff was very helpful and greeted us with sample strawberry daiquiris upon arrival. We were also given a handful of coupons for buy one get one free deals at local clubs and restaurants (mostly for drinks). They also gave us multiple phone numbers for taxi services and the bus schedule. The bus picks up right near the hotel. We were equipped with a map of Key West and the man at the desk was very kind to explain all of the different areas. The hotel also has a list of restaurant recommendations, which are staff favorites. Unfortunately the bus doesn't travel too late. We stayed in a two room suite that was very clean. The living room area was a tad small and the layout awkward, but it was alright. The master suite was very large with a huge comfortable bed with clean white sheets. The bathroom was also very clean. The continental breakfast was average - waffles, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, fruit, juice, hard boiled eggs, cereals are some of the items I remember. The pool area was very nice. The chairs were arranged to make you feel like you were at a private pool. There was a tiki bar (only open until 7 PM); the bartender wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too friendly. The Duval street is not far from the hotel, only a couple of minutes by car. I would not walk. There is also a many franchise restaurants and grocery stores nearby. We only paid $130 a night, so our room was a bargain!",
            "Our stay at the Fairfield Inn in Key West was a very pleasant one. All of the attendants were so friendly and helpful. It was unfortunate that our stay could not have been longer, maybe next time and I certainly would consider staying at the Fairfield again. Thank you, Cheryl Hille",
            "looking on the map this looks like a nice out of the way location. Wrong. It would seem that the road running along the front of the hotel is one of the main roads into Key West. First room seemed was not a suite as described when I booked it and you could put your fingers into the gap around the front door. There was so much road noise that there might as well have not been a front door. We immediately went back to reception and complained. We had to wait 15 mins but were then given a room on the first floor with a front door that did keep the noise out but was still traffic facing (maybe they keep the better rooms for families staying for more than 1 night).Tthe room was very nice and in a good state of repair. If you call a larger room with a double bed and a sofa bed a suite then you will not be disappointed. I do not so I was. The buffet breakfast was ok for free as long as you do not have high expectations and you don't mind sitting in an open covered area with only fans and no a/c (not so good as it was 89 degrees at 0800). You do sit along side a lovely pool though, one of the better features of this hotel. Also the free plentiful parking (some even under cover) is also one of the better features of the hotel. My suggestion, ask for a room at the back of the hotel and things will be fine.",
            "When I called Fairfield Inn I was told the hotel was situated at the beach but in fact it was a mile away - very disappointing. Had I known that in advance I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have booked it. My second disappointment was the poor breakfast selection. Third - no gift shop. Fourth - unpleasant bike/scooter rental service. And finally, some of the stuff members were overly attentive. I would stay there again.",
            "Overall really good hotel, good location, nice rooms even though they were missing some amenities in the rooms (no fridge for example). Even though I rarely use the pool when on vacation because I prefer touring the touristic locations, I have to say the pool area was very charming. You can take your breakfast by the pool which is surrounded by a lush tropical garden, making your experience very enjoyable. Staff was friendly, rooms were clean. The only negative might be the location. While it is nicely located in Key West (easy access - plus the island is small of course :), it is not by the beach if this is what you are looking for.",
            "As I write this review, I am currently in a room in the hotel. Too much road noise and the loud AC have kept me awake so far. 1st impression was not good - even my 6 year old commented that the hotel looked like a red roof inn. 1st room got flooded - was shifted to another room. I am not impressed with this hotel at all. For the money that I paid (160$), I have stayed in far better marriotts in the past. My outlook of marriott has now changed and I will need to be very careful when I select a marriott in the future. I hope that the Sales Manager reads this review and offers me a nice complimentary something to make up for my stay.",
            "I visit Key West once a month. I have stayed in a number of places on the island. This is the best value I have found. The rooms are nice. The location is close enough to the fun spots, yet far enough away that you can actually park your car at your own hotel. (For free and under cover) The staff has always been energetically friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. To keep it fair; the rooms are not brand new but they are clean and in good repair. The one thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like different is a restaurant within walking distance. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at those places and they are not as good a hotel.",
            "I can't say enough about the staff at the Fairfield. The best customer service I've had in a long time! They were very helpful recommending restaurants and activities. They also have THE BEST POOL AND BAR, which is top priority for me, considering the poor beaches @KW. We rented a scooter right on the property, which is KEY! ONLY complaint...rooms could use a little update;)",
            "I booked this 4 night February stay on Priceline and was awarded this hotel. I was happy to get it from previous reviews and they didnt disappoint. They are in a decent location with grocery and other stores nearby with a 5min bike ride to Duval street. Our room was a bit small but was spotless. The pool area and tiki bar while not spectacular did the job very well. The free Wifi at the hotel worked flawlessly. A big plus was the free parking and large selection for continental breakfast. The breakfast area had your basic fruits,cereals,Jimmy Dean breakfast items,juices/coffee,yogurts,waffles,USA Today newspaper and other items. There is a moped and bike rental kiosk onsite also. The from desk staff and other staff may have been the best Ive ever encountered. Kudos to Mirella(sp) I was hoping for the Casa Marina,Reach,Hyatt or Westin when I was bidding on Priceline. They didnt work out and I was given this gem. Thanks for a great stay.",
            "We stayed in one of their suites and while the master bedroom was large, the second room with the pullout couch was not. Service was courteous and \"happy\". However, we had to call three times and deal with multiple visits from the staff before we received sheets and a bed cover for the pullout bed. The room windows are not darkened in any way. Lots of sunlight comes into it. Not good. Finally, the walls are paper thin, we could hear our next door neighbors and because all rooms face an outdoor walkway we would hear everyone that walked by.",
            "My husband and I stayed here in June 2011 on a vacation trip to Key West- and found we made an excellent choice from among the many options available! The entire hotel is very clean and neat and our room (a King studio) was lovely, nicely decorated, and bright. The bed was comfortable and the private balcony overlooking the pool a nice plus. Bathroom was more spacious than most hotels of this type, and tile floors throughout the room were a welcome change from difficult to keep clean carpeting we've encountered at other places. Service from the staff was truly outstanding and always friendly! Everyone we encountered went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and to offer suggestions on how to best enjoy Key West! The pool is lovely (actually as nice as pictured on the hotel website!) with lots of seating available and features a poolside tiki hut that serves a daily reasonably priced drink special along with its regular full bar menu. A poolside limited buffet breakfast was included each morning; food was fresh and menu included a couple of non-standard items along with the typical cereal, fruit, and make-it-yourself waffles. The hotel is located about 2 miles from the \"downtown action\"- but the ease of free parking onsite and sight-seeing trolley that stops there frequently make up for that small inconvenience. This is an entirely nonsmoking hotel- something my husband and I especially appreciated! One drawback for some might be the lack of elevator to the second floor rooms in some areas of the hotel. Although there is no restaurant onsite there are numerous restaurants in the area from which to choose.",
            "When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted with refreshments and big smiles from the staff. Throughout our visit, the staff was very attentive and very friendly. Breakfast bar was fantastic. The drive from the hotel to Mallory Square and Duval Street was about 5-7 minutes. Bicycle and/or scooter rental was available from the hotel. Rooms were nice and clean. Had a problem with the air conditioner, but service technician was there to correct problem within 5 minutes of calling the front desk. Couldn't ask for any better service."

            "My husband and I just stayed at the Grand Hotel this past weekend for Springfest and also to celebrate his birthday. We stay here often, several times a year, and once again had a fabulous experience. The hotel is so conveniently located, rooms are spacious and clean with fabulous views of the beach, great lobby area and coffee shop. The hotel staff is extremely friendly from the moment you call to make a reservation, during your stay, until the time you check out. The entire staff is always great to deal with, however, during this particular visit, Fay at the front desk went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. She was extremely friendly and accommodating. It was so nice to meet someone who really enjoys their job and does it well!!! When we checked out, Fay had a birthday card from the hotel and a piece of cake for my husband. Her kindness and thoughtfulness speaks volumes for the type of service you'll receive. The Grand is fortunate to have an employee as fantastic as she! You will enjoy staying here - and if you're lucky, Fay will greet you when you arrive.",
            "The Grand Hotel has always been my favorite hotel in Ocean City. It's right on the boardwalk and near everything. I went in November alone and still had a great time. (Me Time). The spa is right in the hotel and the massage I had was just what the doctor order. You really didn't have to venture out if you didn't want to. Everything you need is in the hotel. (Spa. restaurant, lounge, indoor pool & game room along with an excerise room.) You even can do minor shopping without going outside. The rooms and views are great!",
            "This place was great! My husband and I stayed here at the end of September on a mid-week madness special. It was worth the drive! Our room had a great view, we got a dinner coupon worth $60. The coffee shop was open all night, which was perfect for us night owls. The girls at the front desk were so much fun. They let us know about all the spots locals go to have fun. We can not wait to come back!!! !",
            "This was our second trip to OC. It is a very expensive destination in comparison to Virginia Beach or Myrtle Beach, but we wanted to give it a second try. We travel extensively and I always research hotels prior to making my decision. Because I felt that I had \"did my homework\" before choosing our hotel, I really want to share our experience. Upon check-in, the level of customer service was poor. Only 1 of 3 agents understood English and their computer system. This made for an extremely long line at 3:00. Our room was very average. It was a decent size, however the bathroom was extremely small. The door had no hooks on the back so there was no place to put your clothes. The mini-kitchen in the room was very handy; although this is standard in most beach hotel rooms. The balcony came with two chairs BUT no table. Very inconvenient. Our room was cleaned very late in the day every day but once, I had to call for housecleaning because at 5:30 they still have not come. Pros of the facility: Common areas very clean Location on boardwalk; ample parking Cons of the facility: Poor customer service No tables in pool area or on balconies Disgusting indoor pool On our third night there, the fire alarm went off at 2am and again at 7am. Is this the fault of their system, or of a stupid individual. Who knows? BUT it sure was annoying. Would we return again to OC? Definately not. The boardwalk games and rides were extremely expensive. You definately get \"more for your buck\" at VA Beach or Myrtle. If we were to return, my #1 choice for accommodations would be The Breaker's Hotel. We went and looked at that hotel and the staff was most pleasant and the rooms were really nice. Good luck in your vacation planning! !",
            "My boyfriend and I stayed at The Grand Hotel, OC MD from 08/19/2011 to 08/22/2011. This hotel, although some reviews were unfavorable, was wonderful! The view from our 6th floor room was of both the ocean and the bayside. Beautiful! The staff was friendly, the room was clean and the ammenities left nothing to be desired. Both indoor and outdoor pool, game room, spa, and the beach was steps away! You could access every store and restaurant from the inside of the hotel so the one night it rained for a while was no problem. Our balcony was large and morning coffee, listening to the waves was very relaxing. Being right on the boardwalk in OC made our stay perfect. The lobby was large- no crowds to be avoided. For those who have had complaints, I think that you should consider the value of a place that puts you in the heart of everything and offers a great nights rest in rooms that are comfortable and clean. We walked around and looked at other hotels to see up close what we had seen online....we were glad we chose the Grand Hotel. No loud parties and very family friendly if traveling with kids. We will definately stay at The Grand again and hope to return with family next year. Thanks to everyone at The Grand for a weekend getaway worthwhile!",
            "We stayed for Memorial Weekend and we must say that we arrived early in the morning and we got our bedroom without a problem. The Room is big with Ocean View and a balcony. It was Clean OK as it was the Bathroom. We had a bikers and a church convention so the crowd was interesting for say the least at least visually. Must say that every one was respectful and we did not have any complains. The noise at night was loud, but then again it was Memorial Weekend so we were expecting it. At Check Out we had a Complimentary hour and a half so our check out was at 12:30 instead of 11:00 am. The staff told us that we could use the 2ND floor restrooms and locker to change if needed. So, we did, it was useful not extremely clean but in good shape and super useful. As mentioned before mixed feelings. The hotel was not that bad, it is outdated but then again Ocean City seems out dated as a whole! Staff was willing to accommodate and the rooms were OK.",
            "Wish we can find a Quiet boardwalk hotel w/the pool bar luxuries & an indoor pool for emergencies. Been here 4 times due to the price (7th, 2nd, 3rd, 6th floors, least expensive room). Had a good view on the 7th floor at the end, better than the 2nd floor w/the railing blocking the view for picture taking. A bit noisy outdoors & the A/C noise was inconsistent (only hummed when it needed to reach thermostat temp). Screen door needed oiling/unrusting. Staff was professional. Apologized when they were talking too loudly at the service elevator. Honored the \"please clean\" sign promptly. Bed & toiletries made beautifully. At the swimming pool, staff put on the lounge coverup & gave a strong towel. Nice to have a tropical drink on the lounge chair:) Boardwalk location had a bit of room so it wasn't exactly right next to the boardwalk.",
            "Me and my wife were checked in on sat of Sep 24 2011.As Soon as I try to check in, they didnt even had my reservation untill I show my paper comfirmation. Front desk guest service were horrible, well They don\u2019t even say word \u201csorry\u201d! it\u2019s not that hard to say it word sorry Also, AC sound like having a big problem~ B/c I thought it was airplane engine was turned on, I could't even sleep well...personally, it was my first time staying in OC with Grand hotel, but it will be my last time...BTW... I will say one good thing is Ocean View...",
            "They advertise in-room WiFi but I could only use my laptop in the lobby. When I called the desk they said they would look into it. That was two days ago. Restaurants and lounge aren't open and there is NO satisfactory food on site. Spa was never open as advertised. I know it's off-season, but there are lots of people here. Staff also sneak into the closed jewelry store and out of the way hallways to smoke. Very unpleasant. The view is beautiful, but that's not worth the complete absence of amenities. House-keeping is the only group that was consistently competent and professional. Next time, I'm heading down the way to Marriott. My rate was very, very low...got what I paid for.",
            "Just wanted to say Thank you to The Grand and Christina at the front desk. We booked at another hotel and it was awful but when we went to the Grand we were able to save our week vacation. Christina at the front desk was so helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back. The room was nice, clean and spacious. The view was beautiful it was great to see the bay and the ocean. Thanks again.",
            "I've been reading a lot of reviews on this site, that said the Grand Hotel was horrible, and to steer clear of it, but I've been staying there for six years, and never once had a problem with it. The rooms are nice, the hotel seems clean and the staff is friendly. There are two pools, which is good since neither pool is ever too crowded. I will admit the rooms are a bit dark (nothing that can't be fixed with a flip of a few switches), and the balcony isn't too private, however, it's a great location and the balcony has ample room to sit any sandy beach toys. The absolute best thing about the Grand is the parking garage, which has quite a lot of space, and is perfect, since finding parking in Ocean City, without having to walk a few blocks and crossing the busy highway isn't exactly easy. Sure, the Grand isn't anything overly special, but it's a great hotel for its price. I definitely recommend.",
            "My family of 4 stayed at grand at was disappointed with the service of employees. Compared to previous years of staying at the hotel the staff does not speak english nor understand very well. Lazy staff and incompetent. This is my last stay here at the grand I will go to another hotel. I would pass on this hotel if you are thinking about staying here because other hotels offer better amenties than this one for the price",
            "Just got home from staying at the Grand Hotel in O.C. and can't wait to go back! The staff from front desk to maids to pool attendants to GM-Patrick were awesome. The rooms are very spacious and the kitchenette was perfect. The view from the room was beautiful even though we didn't have a \"direct view\" room. We lost our car keys on the second day there and General Manager Patrick went above and beyond to get us a replacement key from a dealership 30 minutes away. I highly recommend staying here and if I could I would give them 6 stars!",
            "Our recent stay at The Grand Hotel in Ocean City, MD was good but not exceptional. The big plus was that the room was ocean front. In fact, all of the rooms are ocean front so if this is something that it important to you, than this is the place. The price was definitely reasonable for an ocean front stay. However, the ad on their website did promise free Wi-Fi and that was pretty much non existent unless of course you wanted to spend your time in the lobby. The rooms were decent but it would have been nice if they had at the very least a larger refrigerator. The food choice at the Terrace Restaurant was breakfast only and it was only an option Thurs-Sun which was a bit strange. The lounge, pool bar and exercise room were fairly nice and easily accessible. The front desk staff were rather uninformed which wasn't helpful when spending a vacation in a tourist city. Overall, the experience at The Grand was good but when we go back next time, I think we'll give another hotel a try.",
            "This was a great hotel. Located on the boardwalk, oceanfront was wonderfull. Room was very clean. This is the second time we stayed this summer. Room was very large. Nice size balcony. Little kitchenette had plenty of cabinet space & countertop. Bathroom, beds & carpet was very clean. This end of the boardwalk was very quite & away from the crowd. You leave the hotel & walk across the boardwalk & right down to the beach. Very convenient. We plan to go back in September which will make it the third time this summer. So it must be a very nice place to stay because we would not keep coming back if it wasn't. The only thing that wasn't that great was the breakfast in the restaurant. Will eat somewhere else next time. The bar had great pina collattas.",
            "This hotel has a great location and the way its shaped we got a room with views of both ocean and bayside. There is a cute tiki bar at the pool, but they don't offer pool side service which would make it better. They have alot of amenties in this hotel including a pizza place which is open until midnight and a 24hr cafe. We would def recommend this hotel to others and would come back again!",
            "Pros: Room looks like online photo\u2026pleasant surprise, met expectations Room is spacious\u2026comfortably housed two adults, a teen and a pre-teen Management was responsive to wi-fi issues Housekeeping was very responsive to requests for additional towels and washcloths No problem finding a parking space in garage Great location (far enough away from the main section of the boardwalk, but close enough) Side view room still gave great view of the beach / ocean Easy beachfront access Overall, a comfortable environment Cons: Sliding door to balcony an issue \u2013 way too heavy that my 11 year old could not slide it open (addressed here by management; apparently these are being replaced). General housekeeping was just okay \u2013 in and out of the room in no time flat Only two plastic chairs on balcony \u2013 not comfortable for enjoying the beautiful ocean view (even from our side room) or people-watching Charge for room safe (What\u2019s next? Charging for use of the TV or toilet?) Would I return to the Grand Hotel? Most likely! And note to Management: if my car key / remote is found, please let me know (details left with front desk). Thanks!",
            "We have stayed at the Grand Hotel for 6 years in a row. We love the ocean view. The place is clean and the rooms are very nice and big. The location is great because it is close to all the things my family likes to do at the beach. Phillips restaurant is only a half block away. Right across the street is a new Dairy Queen and Candy Kitchen. Miniature golf is only about a block away. And our favorite breakfast place, Happy Jacks, is only about 2 blocks away. We did notice this year that it is getting time for remodeling. A hotel of this type asking around $300 a night should try to stay fresh and new. (Hopefully the owners and managers read these reviews.) The furnishing are starting to look dated. They need to upgrade to flat screen TVs. The furniture, since it is laminate and not real wood, is really starting to show wear. The bar on the sliding door was broken and missing pieces. When my husband sat in one of the green plastic chairs on the balcony, it broke. They are getting weather worn and brittle and in need of replacing. We love the Grand Hotel. We recommend it to family and friends and will return next year!",
            "This hotel is great for someone who wants to be close to the action but not in the action . You can walk right to the beach and if it is raining there is the option of the indoor pool. The hotel has lots to offer such as a 24hr sweet eatery and there is a bar and spa. Where the hotel lacks is the actual room. The room is clean but not updated. So a little bit of a renovation is due. They room needs new curtains, carpet and the mattress was just ok...my husband did not get a good sleep but I slept ok. My 15yr old son snored loudly and slept as if he was home. The service was good. The front dest was friendly and helpful. It gets three stars for location if it was not for that it would have been two stars. More than likely this family would not return. We will ttry another hotel.",
            "Stayed here for a family beach weekend this summer. It will be our new home for trips to OCMD. The hotel is located on the boardwalk but, unlike other hotels closer to the attractions, it's not like playing a game of Frogger to cross to the beach. It was within easy walking distance to everything we needed - restaurants, snacks, miniature golf - and a very doable walk down to the end of the boardwalk. A bonus is that it's the only round hotel so it's easy to spot when walking the beach or boards. Our room was clean and spacious with a great ocean view. There's no privacy between balconies on the lower floors so sitting outside can be awkward. The upper floors appeared to have screens to remedy that. The 2nd floor rooftop pool was fantastic with a full bar and towel service. We were there several times each day for a dip. See you next summer, Grand Hotel!",
            "Stayed here while attending an event at the convention center. The Grand Hotel is located nicely and my room (1105) had a wonderful southern view of the boardwalk and beach. The large room with two queen beds was comfortable and quiet. The refrigerator was convenient, and the hotel staff are very responsive. I booked anextra room for my hospitality suite one night and the staff cleared out the beds and replaced the beds with rounds and chairs for my guests. Even the California Cheesteak in the pizzaria on the gound floor was of special quality. I will certainly return!",
            "We usually go to Myrtle Beach every year and this year we thought we would try something different. What a mistake that was. When we made reservations, we asked about their entertainment and we were told that \"there is something going on here every night\". They ACTUALLY had entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights only. The restraunt was closed for 2 days for a private party. Just as well though because the doors to it were filthy with fingerprints all week long so we wouldnt have eaten there anyway. The lounges, restraunts, pool bar, pizza parlor and the shops were all owned by a third party and you could not charge food or drinks to your room. (I guess they thought people go swimming with their cash and credit cards in their pockets). I asked about smoking in the lounge and instead of saying \"I'm sorry sir but Maryland state law prohibits smoking inside\" The bartender instead said \"If you want to smoke, go outside\". There were kids skateboarding in the parking garage all day Thursday, .although there was a sign saying NO SKATEBOARDING. My concern was one of them losing control and hitting my motorcycle. We also looked for the hot tub as we thought for sure that a place that called themselves a resort would have one. We were wrong. It seemed to me as if after we checked in and they billed my charge card, that's all they cared about. For over 250.00 per night, the management team should visit Myrtle Beach resorts and learn customer relations from them.",
            "I stayed at the Grand with my wife and two kids. Our room was extremely large and comfortable compared to most hotels in the area. We were able to thrown down a blow up mattress and still have plenty of room to move around. The ice machine was right outside my door and I never heard a peep late at night. The rooms seem to be very quite and soundproof compared to other hotels I have stayed in. We did not use the pools, but they seemed well maintained to me. The beach outside of the hotel is the best selling point - it's GRAND!!! When compared to staying in other locations in Ocean City, the beach at this location is very large and accommodates large crowds without making you feel like a sardine. The front desk staff was very friendly and helped with any issues and/or questions we had. Yes, I'll be back...",
            "We checked in and were expecting a \"nice\" ocean view; however, our room was on the crappy 2nd floor. We could barely see the ocean due to the 1st floor shops and the restricting balcony. If you are staying, request a room 3rd floor or above. The 2nd floor's ice machine was also broken. We rode to the 12th (top) floor to get ice and everyone was complaining up there because it was so hot on the 12th floor. No free breakfast here, but you can go to the coffee shop where you will pay $5.50 for a latte or $2.75 for a cup of black coffee. Upon entering our room, there was fecal matter that was \"left behind\" from the previous guests. It was awful and disgusting, on the side of the toilet. Disappointed in the house keepers. I also would have to agree with a previous reviewer--the pillows are terrible, so bring your own or request 12 extras at check in. I had to ask 3 times for 4 extra pillows. They weren't too happy with me. Very outdated furniture and television. I guess that's why the price is so-so. I would highly recommend staying elsewhere. This was my first and last time at the Grand.",
            "My husband and I stayed the Memorial Day Weekend and it was very pleasant. We had a wonderful view of the ocean. The room was clean and our maid service was very good. It was nice being right there on the boardwalk, didn't need your car to get anywhere. The room was very large and the bed was comfortable. The staff was very helpful and I would recommend this hotel to anyone",
            "Every year my family goes to OC in January and again in March for the children's birthdays. We always book two rooms for my sister's family and my own. We had just checked into the Grand, with minor problems, we always request adjoining rooms and that seems to be a small problem for this hotel, but, the fire alarm and sprinkler system had gone off on our floor and to be precise in the room right next to mine and my sisters, we waited patiently while the staff was in the room where the sprinkler originally went off, the carpeting in our rooms were soaked as was some of our luggage and kids toys, etc. We waited about 1/2 hour and I finally went and asked one of the staff what to do about our rooms, they barely made eye contact as they sent me to the front desk. Once at the front desk, they acted as though it was my problem, after some convincing they gave us two new rooms, but, made no gesture to help us move our luggage or belongings, When I told the manager it would be nice to be comped an additional nights stay either during this stay or for our stay that was pending for March. They told me that they could not do that. We booked two rooms at the very least (4) times a year and they could not offer any compensation for our inconvenience. I was very very disappointed in management at that point and we have begun staying at a different resort at the Ocean.",
            "My husband, granddaughter and I just spent a wonderful week at the Grand Hotel in Ocean City Maryland. We have been coming to Ocean City for the past 14 years for the Maryland State Fire Association Convention and I think this is the best place that we have stayed! Our room was very spacious and clean. The staff were very friendly and courteous. Our 6 year old granddaughter loved the indoor pool. We spent a lot of time at the outdoor pool which was very nice. Several of our friends who belong to our local fire department stayed at the Grand and they too were very satisfied. We will definitely be back again next year!",
            "Just got back from our Ocean Ciy vacation today. We stayed at the Grand this year. After having a less than grand time there in 2008 (anyone who has read my tirade after our July '08 vacation knows what I'm talking about) we took a break and stayed somewhere else last year. We came back to the Grand because the location is perfect. I must say that I am glad we did!!! Check in was a breeze, we got the floor we wanted, the view was FANTASTIC (we had more of an ocean view than we ever had before). How lovley to lay in bed and see the ocean!! The hotel was clean, staff was very friendly and helpful. There MUST have been a change of management. A change for the good!!! I will be happy to again recommend The Grand! !",
            "I want to start out by saying the housekeeping staff was very timely and efficient. The hotel is nice, and on the quieter end of the boardwalk, but needs to finish updating rooms. Especially needs knew sliding doors, (among other improvements) that are not fogged and you can open and close without a struggle. There is a lack of communication between employees at the hotel front desk, we received different check-in information from different employees, which was a little frustrating and confusing. Also, one of the front desk managers, Nina, needs to work on her people skills. A manager can be an efficient manager or be an efficient manager with interpersonal skills. As far as achieving those skills, that would depend on how much of a priority good customer service is to that manager and to the hotel.",
            "When my group arrived to start our golf vacation, we were thoroughly impressed. The rooms were beautiful, the staff was great, and the ammenities were spectacular. I booked this hotel since it was on the boardwalk. I never realized all that the Grand Hotel had to offer. We enjoyed the nightclub, which made it alot safer for us to enjoy a few cocktails after our rounds of golf. The 24 hour coffee shop was a delight all by itself. This is the place that we all would gather in the morning get a cup of coffee and then get on the road to our golf course destination. Iwould strongly recommend the Grand Hotel to everyone I know and any and all who ask me where to stay while in Ocean City. I am putting together another golf trip for my gang of misfits and the Grand Hotel is at the top of the list for accomodations.",
            "My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hotel on 21st St on 3/29/2012. I had won a contest at the Grand and received a room upgrade as my gift, so when I booked the room, Matt Brown at the Grand gladly upgraded my room to direct oceanfront. I also had asked for a high floor and they again accomodated my request. When we checked in, we were greeted by Erin who was very sweet and competent, and she even called our room a short while later to see if we were satisfied and if there was anything we needed. Very few hotels do this any more, even the so called \"upscale\" hotels in OC. Our room was a 2 queen with efficiency kitchen, dining area, and bathroom. The room was very large, very clean and nicely kept up. The cabinets in the kitchen appeared to be new as well. My only issues were that the mattresses were a bit soft and had wells when we slept, and the bathroom was a bit smaller than we would have liked, but it was clean and satisfactory. The oceanfront balconies on all floors except the top three have open balconies so there is no privacy if that's important to you. I think the reason for this is to give everyone the best possible view considering that the hotel is basically a half circle. I didn't have the chance to try the spa or pools, but our stay was very nice and I would stay there again. Thank you Grand for such a nice stay.",
            "I'm a 54 year old woman who went for a week in July with my mother as a special birthday treat for myself. The first night (Saturday) we were on the 2nd floor and the noise was horrible. Doors slamming, people yelling in nearby rooms, etc. Sunday we asked to be moved and apparently there was only one room available at \"our rate\" and we would be called when it was available. We waited all day, checking in occasionally to see if we could move and for some reason it took until my 5:30 call to get the other room. That was basically 2 days of my vacation! Then the voice mail didn't work, the iron didn't work (took two calls and several hours to get an iron!) Amenities were not left by the cleaning service so we had to track down the maid's cart several times to get shampoo, etc. I wrote to the hotel with my complaint and received no reply. I wrote to the management company and received no reply. Bottom line is I spent over $1,400 for the room, money in the restaurant, money in the salon and money in the shops. Next time I'll know better and spend my money where I am appreciated as a customer.",
            "3 months ago, i booked my vacation with the grand. i originally wanted a regular room with direct ocean view. i later found out that one was available, but jacuzzi suits had direct ocean view. so i spent the extra money and booked that room. when i had checked in i had their first room, all the way to the right. barely any view, most of the view was there parking lot. i called front desk and they changed me over 6 rooms? why couldn't that be done earlier? .. note (this happened the previous year as well). after one night at the hotel we find out that the plumbing in the room was not working, then later found out the whole 12th floor had a problem, water had no pressure to make it to the 12th floor, water toilets would just stop. General Manager, told me they would fix it. 5 days 4 nights later same problem was happening, water would stop for up to 30 sec. He sent me a bottle of Champagne that i spit out because it was probably a $3.99 bottle. No refund, no refund/partial discount, nothing. Is this normal did i pay more for this? Not to mention the staff are all college/ foreign exchange students who barely speak the language. This will be my last time at this hotel, i have been going to ocean city for 15 yrs. now and will try the Marriot (brand new ), Hilton (expensive but worth it) or the Holiday in Suit (which is in- between the two). P.S. not to mention the complimentary FIRE ALARM EVACUATION AT 10:30 p.m., looks like another reoccurring problem the \"GRAND\" has put aside to fix.",
            "Once again another fab weekend here !! The storm came through and was wonderful to see from the amazing view point of the 8th floor. And the next day glorious sunshine, blue skys and sea !! Just breath taking. Service was impeccable as always !! The kids had such fun at the pool !! And they were tuckered out after so weactually got some rest ;) Thanks to the Grand Family ! !",
            "This hotel may have once been \"grand\" but the time has passed. The rooms are large but lacking in amenities. The mattress feels old and the pillows flat. Instead of sitting at the desk to work, I had to hover by the door to my room to connect to the Internet. The balconies do not have solid dividers so you are looking into your neighbor's space and the \"furniture\" on the balconies consists of cheap plastic chairs. The view of the ocean is beautiful but, unfortunately, I couldn't see it because there was condesation trapped inside the sliding door and blocking any view out. There was even an envelope requesting a tip for the maids! I'm not sure about the value for the money issue as I was not paying for the room but the hotel left much to be desired. I have to believe there are better places to stay in OC.",
            "I last stayed at The Grand in Aug of 2009. The last time I stayed, I booked an ocean front room. I like to look out of the balcony and people watch or listen to the waves crash at night. This time around I booked my vacation late and there weren't any ocean front rooms available. We had an ocean view room which you can still see the ocean and the boardwalk from. Everything was pretty much the same as last time. The rooms clean, the staff is friendly, the pool is a little on the smaller side but the outside pool bar is fantastic. The one issue I had was some of the other guest. On both sides of our room we had loud quest. They came in at night at very early hours, obviously drunk and rowdy. Two doors down, a guest had passed out drunk in his chair on the balcony. The ocean front rooms are only about $10 more a night and I would of gladly spent the extra money to not have to deal with that nonsense. My assumption is that a better class of people would stay at the ocean front rooms. Its not something that the hotel can really control (who stays there) and it was just a minor annoyance. Not something I would hold against the hotel itself. Its still a pretty good hotel situated right on the boardwalk, great location, fairly clean rooms, friendly staff and awesome pool bar.",
            "My wife and I and two kids stayed at the Grand for a quick family weekend in OC. The views of the ocean, boardwalk and bay were great (by the shape of the hotel it seems that all of the rooms would have a nice view). I also like the location, it is on the boardwalk so you can get to the pier easily but not too close to the craziness. Our room was clean and very spacious (ours had a nice counter/sink with fridge/etc and a large balcony). The front desk person was friendly and the kids enjoyed the arcade/indoor pool. It was in April so the outdoor pool was closed but it seemed like it would be nice place to hang out, there was a nice poolside bar. The rate was compettiive, everyone liked it, we will definately stay there next time we are in OC.",
            "I am surprised to see some of the bad reviews written on this page! My wife and I (and our neighbors... we talked to them in the elevator) had an excellent stay. We stayed on a busy weekend, when the hotel was booked to capacity with a bunch of screaming kids. I was concerned about getting sleep, but the hotel staff had it under control. They implemented a curfew for the kids and we slept peacefully. We had a nice ocean view at a reasonable price. We loved the 24 hour coffee shop and the lounge on the first floor! Even though we came in January, the staff knew what to do and where we should go. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.",
            "We came to Ocean City to celebrate our sons 4th birthday. We are true beach lovers and have stayed at many places in OC. Our main concern was clean, comfortable place to stay that is close to the beach. The hotel was very clean, beds were pretty comfortable, and the view was so so.The rooms are huge but bathrooms very small. We had a grandview room (sort of on the side) but it is not private from your neighbors at all. Probably the only complaint was the elavators. There were only 2 of the 4 working so it made for alot of rude behavior because everyone wanted to go and they werent willing to compromise. Typical! Overall a very nice trip. We would definitely return!",
            "Stayed here last week. Hotel check in tells us only oversized cars can park in front. We own a cadillac escalade esv and could have rode over all the compact cars parked where the oversized cars should be parking. Main restaurant does not serve lunch or dinner you have to go to pizzeria. We ate there for breakfast, it took 30 minutes for the food and when we asked for ketch up, the was mold around the rim and in the cap itself. In the game room four of the game either did not work or ate your money which meant going down to front desk to get a credit to your room and $1 for a game of Ms. pacman is robbery. We asked at front desk if we can charge services and food to our room. Of course all the restaurants and coffee shop and ice cream parlor scoops all accept our card, so we get it and guess what most places do not take it and everywhere you go signs say cash only. Ok can deal with no hotel room charges but no credit cards, every store though has a cash machine where hey get three bucks per swipe and then your own bank charges you on top of that. And god forbid you complain, the staff then starts speaking in their own language and laughing at you. Hotel is convenient to a lot but the rooms are somewhat run down, we had what looked like someone punched 2 holes in the wall and someone just pasted a piece of wall paper of it and the bathrooms were run down and the ceiling tiles above the 5 lights over the mirror were showing signs of burning from the heat.",
            "Just returned from a wonderful time at The Grand Hotel. The hotel is kept so nice and clean. Everything is there for you - outdoor pool with towel service, indoor pool, game room, bar, coffee shop and pizzeria right in hotel. The rooms are very large with beautiful views of the ocean. The staff is wonderful - attentive, courteous and friendly. Patrick the General Manager is always available and visible should any problems arise. The housekeeping staff under the direction of Elizabeth is superb. Never did I have to ask for anything - everything was put in my room (towels, shampoo, etc.). The people that work the front desk (Nina, Cara, Levi, Denise, James, Matthew just to name a few) are so nice and quick. The location of the hotel is perfect - far enough away from all the noise of the boardwalk but close enough should you want to be within walking distance (15-20 minute walk). Also the hotel is right on the beach - what more could you ask for!!!! The Grand is Grand and there is no other place I would stay! !",
            "I wouldn't stay anywhere else on the boardwalk. The rooms are nice along with the helpful and friendly staff. My family each year just love love love staying at the Grand Hotel from the food to the cheapest shopping in their lovely shops. I would suggest this hotel to anyone that goes to Ocean City. This is one of the most clean hotels that I have stayed at thus far in Ocean City.",
            "Loved the hotel, my husband and I took my little cousin and her friend june 11-15, it was senior week so at night it was VERY loud. That was no problem! The view was amazing from the 10th floor. Everyone there was super nice everything was clean and well taken care of. I am nothing bad to say about this hotel it was the best hotel we have stayed in so far in OCMD. Thanks everyone at the grand hotel for making our stay wonderful:-)",
            "Great hotel layout and a great location. Other than that the Hotel is horrible. Our room was musty, the bed was terrible, had wrinkled carpet, ripped wallpaper, stains on the ceiling, broken tile in the bathroom, and a sliding door to the balcony that could only be unlocked and locked with much effort. This was the upgraded room that we were given after refusing to stay in the second floor room that we were given at check-in. It appears that there is no form of maintenance at all in the rooms. There are two pools that are nice other than they are used by anyone (not hotel guests) that wants to use them. The hotel restrooms and exterior showers are also used by anyone and everyone in the area. This would not be a problem if the hotel guests were not impacted by \"public\" use of all of the amenities that we paid for. There was never a hotel employee around at the pools, restrooms, or showers to check to see who was a guest and who was not. If you want to wait by the outside shower to clean off your feet after being at the beach while a family of 10 showers (soap and shampoo included) this is the place for you. I took my son to the game room and we could only find two out of the many games available that would actually work. I would not be so disappointed by the condition of the hotel if I had pulled off of 95 and got a $59.00 room. We paid well over $200.00 per night. I would not recommend this hotel at all.",
            "What a true disappointment!!! Our kids could not check in the hotel without a parent's signature on a paper stating we would take responsibility. My child was over the age of 18 (isn't that still considered an adult???). During check-in several seniors had to wait for their parents to fax or email this paper. Of course, the hotel was happy to take our child's money before this paper was received. When speaking to the manager, he acted as if he didn't care and basically stated we could find somewhere else. Not very good customer service. Good luck Seniors!! !",
            "We recently stayed at the Grand Hotel & Spa in Ocean City, Maryland. The hotel is convieniently located on the boardwalk with many amenities within the hotel itself. We stayed in the King Jacuzzi Suite on the twelveth floor. We encountered a problem with our room on the first night but the manager Kara took care of our concerns and did everything possible to ensure a pleasant stay at the hotel. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience during our stay at the Grand. We reccommend this hotel without reservation. The only suggestion I would make to the hotel would be to add a love seat or sofa in the Jacuzzi Suite to watch television. Thumbs up!! !",
            "We stayed at this hotel for the Sand Duels soccer tournament with the U-11 and U-9 girls teams. We typically stay at the Hilton in OC but The Grand Hotel is a better deal. The only downside is that they don't have room service, but the deliver services in OC are great, and you are right on the boardwalk so finding a decent place to eat is EASY. The rooms are clean and spacious, and all have great views. Definitely returning.",
            "We stayed this past week and I was a little disappointed in the hotel. I've been to Ocean City many times and have stayed at the Rodeway Oceanfront, Quality Inn Boardwalk and the Dunes Manor Hotel. I have always thought the Grand looked so nice so I decided to book it for a friend weekend getaway. I was disapponted in a few things - the ice machines are every other floor and we had to go to 5 different floors before we could fill our very small cooler to take onto the beach, the air conditioning kicked off and on which kept us awake, there is no ventilation in the bathroom such as a fan to remove steam after a shower - which I would think that would cause alot of mold in their walls but who knows...there was constant noise from people opening and closing their sliding glass doors above or beside us, noise from people closing hallway doors, people being loud on the patios - the patios are not private from on another, the elevators didn't work so well and you had to wait forever. I dealt with a person at the front desk who was very nice the first day and the rest of the time the staff wasn't so nice. For what we paid here, I was a little disappointed. Overall it was OK but I think that it looked so much better than what I experienced.",
            "This was my husband's and I first time at the Grand celebrating our 1st year anniversary and we enjoyed every bit of it. We had a direct oceanfront view on the top and we couldn't have asked for anything more. Whenever we did have an issue, housekeeping and/or maintenance addressed our concerns immediately and efficiently. The service was great, hotel was clean and the employees were courtesy. We didn't eat at the hotel so I cannot comment on the food. The only thing that bothered me were the elevators. One was out of service one day and on another day it was slow. But honestly, it didn't bother us or interfere with our overall stay which is why I'm giving it a rating of 5 stars.",
            "I loved your hotel! We still talk about it. We have reccomended it to several friends. i have been going to OC for years and haven't stayed in a nicer room. We had an Oceanfront room and it was clean and the bed was comfortable. The room was not your usual beach hotel room, it was much fancier. We got a really good rate because of it being Thanksgiving week, and for $10 more we were able to upgrade. Location was awesome. Lobby was beautiful, with Christmas music playing and everyone was friendly including the front desk staff and the bartender. Would consider going back this Thanksgiving and staying with you again. Do you offer any packages for Thanksgiving?",
            "Nina Railean was especially helpful at accomodating our needs, even when they seemed to be unpleasant in any circumstance. She went out of her way to ensure that we recieved quality assistance and accomodation in order to make our honeymoon an enjoyable one. We really appreciated her efforts and hope to return in the future. Thank you, Nina!",
            "I am pleased to say that my wife and I had a really great experience at the Grand Hotel. Nice oceanfront room with a gigantic balcony. Action packed hotel/area with great choices of food, beverage and of course the Atlantic Ocean just 20 steps from the back door. Mr. Staib, the general manager runs a clean cut operation. Staff were friendly and accommodations were clean and comfortable. Being a GM of a hotel, I can appreciate being a guest especially in an environment such as the Grand Hotel. Keep up the great job and we will look forward to seeing you again next year!",
            "Our association has been using the Grand for the past 4 years and we have had nothing but the best service. The staff are very friendly and caring, especially Robin, Nina, Anna and Erin. They made a point of going out of their way to accomodate our every needs. If there were any concerns, the staff immediately took care of them.",
            "Although I personally thought this was a nice hotel in a great location I can see how some people would be a bit dissapointed. We paid for an Oceanveiw room and were placed on the ground floor with a veiw of the roof. (Why dont they put a pool here?) We couldnt really see the ocean from our room but it was something we could deal with. Although the rooms seemed clean they were very dark and frankly depressing. When you go to a beach hotel, you want light and color! I liked the indoor and outdoor pool area and the pool bar. I would stay here agian if they lowered the rates. For what you get I dont think its worth the inflated prices they try to charge. If you are coming with family rent a condo at the Ocean hideaway or seagate instead and save $$$!!! !",
            "Just returned fromOcean City Maryland.We stayed at the Grand Hotel and Spa on 21st.Very clean and well kept.The rooms overlooking the ocean are breathtaking.Their balconies are very large.Location is great and staff is friendly.The pool area is wonderful u are treated to a towel and pillow on your lounge chair and the bar is an added touch.Cant say enough good things about this Hotel.Would definately return there again! !",
            "Fourth of July week we stayed at the grand for 7 nights. It was very nicely located with a 24 hours cafe downstairs, 2 pools , 2 bars and some beach stores to shop in. The beach was just a few steps away and very clean. The beds were comfortable, housekeeping was very welcoming and helpful, and the room was very clean. the only thing I wish I had for paying such good money would be a newer television and free hott breakfast of some kind. Overall the stay was great and staff was friendly. See you next year !",
            "I Understand that fire alarms are there to protect us but we have stayed here for the past six or seven years and have been evacuated every year. Some years more than once. For me its an inconvience and annoying. For my kids its scarey. My seven year old is scared to go back. Last year he couldnt sleep and grinded his teeth all night long. The fire alarm went off of course and then the rest of our vacation he wanted to go home! It was a nightmare. Its a shame because we like everything else about this hotel. Nice hotel with a major fire alarm problem!",
            "I booked this for a \"girl friends only getway\" I asked for a room with a great view. The front desk staff assured me of a great view and she was right! wonderful view from the nice large CLEAN room. The staff was very nice and polite!",
            "After reading the reviews here, I was probably more likely to be on the lookout for negatives. That said, our stay was perfectly comfortable. We booked a month in advance for a wedding and were given a rate of around $120 for an ocean view room (I believe all the rooms are ocean view). When we checked in, I noticed what some of the reviews have complained about: a faint smoke smell, some older furnishings, etc. We were next to a standard room that seemed to be filled with about a dozen guys in their 20s who were partying in their room and on the balcony. We wanted a quiet night, so we called down for a room change. At first the clerk wanted to charge us $75 to downgrade to a room with a worse view (we didn't really care about the view at this point), but after speaking to his manager, he upgraded us to non-smelly, recently updated room on the 11th floor. And it was quiet! After the room change we were much happier. The only negatives were that the a/c was very loud when it cycled on and that light fixture in the bathroom seemed to be causing the paint to melt, which seemed like a safety concern. All in all we had a comfortable stay, but if we had stayed in the original room or had to pay $75 for a quiet room, I would probably be writing a negative review.",
            "Positives: Our room was very clean, large, and the bed was comfortable. We had a small refrigerator in the room which was nice for snacks and leftovers. The staff was courteous and helpful. The spa was VERY nice to have right in the hotel (I had a pedicure). You literally walk out of the hotel onto the boardwalk, no steps to go up or down. There was a parking garage right next door so our car did not have to bake in the sun (which was appreciated during the nearly 100 degree days). Negatives: Breakfast in the restaurant was only ok and very over-priced. The walls were a bit thin and we could hear our neighbor's TV and could even hear them talking. The air conditioning unit was set to \"auto\" and was glued so it could not be changed. This caused the air to turn on and off constantly as the thermostat adjusted. Normally this would not be an issue, but the unit was so loud each time it turned on, that it sometimes woke us up during the night. Though there is direct boardwalk access, the hotel is located toward the upper end which makes for a LONG walk to any of the attractions. Overall: We were glad to have a clean and comfortable room on the boardwalk, but will probably try another hotel closer to the boardwalk attractions next time.",
            "Very nice place to stay. Great value with very clean and well kept rooms and facilities.Couldn't ask for much better at the beach. Coffee shop open 24hrs where you can get just about anything to eat such as bagels, donuts, pizza, ice cream, sandwiches, drinks,etc.Good accomodations in the room but could use one more lamp and a comfortable lounging chair. Had one problem with teenagers at 3:00AM which took Security too long to respond. Aside from that problem I would definitely stay there again. Very nice and on the beach. Good parking in front of building and with an undercover dropoff area. Parking garage only a short walk across street. Courteous workers.",
            "This is a very clean family oriented hotel, with great services, and locations to everything. I highly recommend this hotel for your next stay weather it's with your family or just as a couple to get away to enjoy the spa, bar, or just to spend time on the beach...",
            "This is an older hotel, however, it has undergone a renovation. I've stayed at this hotel three years in a row now, mostly because of the price. Nice hotels in Ocean City are just TOO EXPENSIVE! This hotel is somewhat over priced as well. But it is the nicest hotel in its price range in Ocean City. Everything about this hotel is average. In past years, it was not as clean as my stay this past summer. But is was very clean this summer. The rooms are okay. Almost all have ocean views. They are also a nice size. The balconies are very old. The internet service was SHOTTY at best.",
            "This is located on 21st street, a bit of a walk from boardwalk activities and restaurants. Stayed in room 1112 (11th floor center). Room average, you can get same room quality for less at other hotels. View was breath taking!!!! Outside pool located on parking lot side in order to get afternoon and sunset sun. Pool is kind of small. Pool bar is great and food is good. I rented the cabana by the pool one day and was worth it, however it was only set up for two people, so if you need more than that, you should go around 10am to check in with attendant to get more chairs. It was $50 for all day. You can leave and come back if you want.",
            "Very bad experience! First off all for the amount of money you pay you get Zero customer service! The rooms are ok! Not that great. They charged us around $640.00 more than what we were suppose to pay just by \"accident\" thank God my husband noticed it and when we confronted the front desk not that she didnt apologize, she even gave us an attitute! It was so fraustrating! :( We went to let the manager \"patrick\" know and he took his employee's side and gave us a very cold apology that you could see he doesnt even mean it. He didn't even ask us if here is anything he could do for us or anyway we can leave with a good experience! Nothing!!!! Even when we asked for just a couple of hours of late check out he said no!!!! Never will book here again! They are so many nice hotels ocean front and so much cheaper! Do your research!!!! !",
            "I really loved \"The Grand\"! My boyfriend and I got the Weekend Escape Package and had a wonderful time. We didn't like the location of the room because it was on the outter side of the building so we asked from another room with a better view. Kyle had no problem accommodating us within our package's terms. The room was clean, beds were very comfortable and the price was well worth it. Arlene was also very helpful. The bartender was very sweet and personable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",
            "Our family of four stayed in a Premier view room which they told me was a sideview, unobstructed. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought we were in an oceanfront room. The view of the ocean was great. The hotel sits right on the board walk, but not in a crazy busy section - perfect for families. The ocean was so close; it was amazing. Every staff member was professional and courteous. Check in was fast and easy. We could usually park right in the front parking lot; but there is also a ramp garage right next to the hotel that always had plenty of spots. The room was larger than most hotel rooms. Two queen beds and plenty of room for a roll-a-way ($10 per nite) and plenty of room to walk around. Good kitchen space - microwave, sink, plenty of cupboards, refridgerator, coffee maker. Bathroom was a bit small but had plenty of counterspace and a large mirror. We had a bit of a problem opening the sliding door to the balcony. We called the front desk, and somebody was there within 5 minutes. He stated they were in the process of replacing all the sliding doors (3 floors had already been completed) and showed us some tricks to make sliding the door open easier (the track was bent), For the price, location, cleanliness, convenience of being right on the boardwalk and having both an indoor and outdoor pool plus the shops and restaurants right there in the hotel, the Grand cannot be beat! We would definitely stay here again! Can't wait for next summer!",
            "Over the years, we have stayed at numeous hotels when visiting Ocean City. Once we discovered the Grand Hotel, we don't even consider another location. The staff are very accommodating, clean rooms are in good repair, wireless Internet access is available, small stores on the boardwalk side offer a cafe, pizza shop and various small shops. When we visit during \"Cruise-In\" weekends, you can get a coffee and donut from the cafe and sit on the boardwalk in front of the hotel to watch the cruiser parade. We love it! The Grand Hotel's location close to the end of the boardwalk is perfect for us to walk to most of our favorite destinations. A parking garage offers plenty of parking space. Our only bad experience during the most recent trip was with the Terrace Restaurant; I don't know if it is managed by the hotel or an outside group but I wouldn't recommend going to the restaurant for breakfast.",
            "We planned a quick vacation for 3 days, we came across The Grand Hotel thur ocean city's website.The rooms were very clean, they had everything that you needed in the room. the rooms were very nice. Every room in the hotel has a view of the boardwalk and the ocean. (side view or ocean front) There were 2 pool 1 outside and 1 inside. The outside pool was very nice it had a pool bar. they say that you could also order food there but the 2 diffrent days that we tried we were told that they were too busie to order (overpriced)food. The inside pool was nice but smelled too much like bleach. They have a breakfast buffet on the six floor, Pass it up the food is awful (my kids would not eat it the food was not hot, luke warm) also when you walked out side of the hotel (entrance from parking lot) the smell of trash was overwellming. They keep ther dumpsters inside two overhead doors.",
            "We stayed overnight at Grand Hotel on June 14 so my daughter and her friend can go to H20 that night. The hotel was located right on the boardwalk and a walking distance to the main attractions of OC boardwalk as well as few steps to the beach. You also have the option to use the tram or bus. The hotel is near everything-food, shopping, mini golf etc. The room was spacious and clean. The balcony was also a plus-nice view of the ocean. The front desk staff were all helpful and very polite. I felt safe letting my teen & her friend do their own thing while me and my 11 yr old son did ours. We were even able to enjoy the beach the following day during our checkout date since we didn't have to move our car out of the parking garage till 2pm. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to couples, families with kids or teens and even seniors. I was also lucky to get the room at a great price since it was early June and I booked it a while ago.",
            "Perfect location but rooms and amenities in general need some serious updates. Looks worn out and rusty. Beds are so cheap and the lowest quality, it's screaming for replacement. This could easily be a top notch hotel in Ocean City, if the interiors and facilities are upgraded to current or at least 4-star standards.",
            "Very nice hotel. Rooms are great layout and size wise. They were clean and comfortable with nice views and balcony. Swimming pools (indoor and outdoor) were nice and clean. Fitness center could use some updating but still was very usable. The bathroom was nice with decent space and had a decent layout. The hotel was clean inside and out, and even the parking garage. Always had plenty of parking for me and my friends' car. Perfect location on the boardwalk, you can walk right out onto it and walk all the way up and down. Will stay there again, I had no problems what so ever and I must say the A/C and Heat worked great! I had a mini fridge and microwave with a wet bar / sink. If they could improve it would be better tv's like plasma or lcd, but the size was good.",
            "The rooms are really large and have small kitchenettes. Each room has a balcony. The only issue was that there were no solid dividers between balconies so you could hear and partially see the people next to you. There was a mesh screen of some sort between balconies. The place is very large and they have a restaurant that serves lunch and breakfast. We enjoyed sitting around the pool and having frozen drinks from the pool bar. It is quite a walk to the activities on the boardwalk but there is a tram that runs down the boardwalk. My daughter really enjoyed playing chess with the giant chess set.",
            "Overpriced, cheap furniture, bad flooring(carpet lifting) wallpaper peeling, tight bathroom, water malfunction in the tub took forever to go down, pregnant back tv, really, my child couldn't hook his game up, no wi fi for our stay there, according to them bad weather, hmmm, is we not in the same place, hmmm, yu'll pull a muscle trying to open the balcony door, plastic ran down chairs on the balcony, and the curtains were dirty.....and fo the $$$$'s we paid. What a Lovely stay #bookelsewhere",
            "We stayed in a \"Direct Ocean Front\" on the 7th floor. The view was the boardwalk going North and the beach. We arrived at Monday, Labor Day about 3pm. They said our room was not ready and would call us when it was. The regualr time for check in is 4pm. We decided to take a walk down the boards. Received a call about 4:10pm and checked in. When we opened the door it was an oder like bad feet. The room was tidy and clean but the carpet was all lumpy. We're not sure where the oder was coming from but I thought it had to be the carpet. The room was large and had a balcony that is not private. So, when I went out to read there was someone else out on their balcony. The bathroom was small but clean. They had toiletries if needed. They had a restaurant for breakfast and lunch. We ate breakfast and it was good. The 24 hour coffee cafe has donuts and all kinds of bakery goods and will make breakfast and lunch sandwhiches any time of the day or night. Their coffee wasn't Starbucks or Ducan Donuts but was drinkable. Philips Seafood restaurant was across the street and liquor store and Dairy Queen also. They have a nice beach. They have a safe, and micro kitchen also. We asked for a late check out and there was no problem. I would stay there again but I hope they freshen the rooms.",
            "My husband, two kids (ages 9 and 11) and Iarrived at this hotel last minute without a reservation at 7am on a Friday morning. We were very fortunate to find this place during the weekend of the Dew Tour. The lady at the front desk was very kind and there were plenty of staff available to help with people checking in and out. The lady helping us provided us with a reservation for that day (checkin at 4pm) but allowed us to checkin at 7am so my husband and I could get some rest since we had been driving all night. The room was very clean! Spacious bathroom and plenty of clean towels for all of us. We did not have an ocean view room, but with the way the hotel is designed we could still see the ocean from our room. There was a refrigerator in the room along with a coffee maker and a variety of coffee packets and vending machines on each floor. The kids loved the arcade and the indoor and outdoor pool. The staff at the pool was excellent providing us with towels so we did not have to take our beach towels from the beach to the pool and treck all the sand back to the pool with us - which we thought was great! We would def. stay here again.",
            "The Grand doesn't live up to name . The hotel is a diamod location and the bones of the building are good but as a gem ...Its a pearl at best. The room had wall paper pealing apart ( rm 411), The funiture was very cheap and took away instantly from any wow factor that should be with this Grand building. No drink cups in bathroom, ceiling fan in bathroom not working. All and all the Grand was like a bad xmas package....Wrapped very nice on internet and to look at but not much inside ! Hint... Go to a Borgata.... Grand,,hint hint ...inside and out ! Oh and AC very noisy.in room. Disturbed sleep every time it came on.",
            "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Hotel from Aug 28-Aug 30 for a quick getaway. The hotel is what is it. But is served its purpose for the 2 nights we were there. The positives: the location (walking distance from the Boardwalk and the beach), the hotel seems to have everything (clothing stores, salon, ice cream parlor, pizza place) on its premises. The negatives: not the cleanest, no wifi in the rooms (only available in the lobby--how ghetto is that!! ), you can't connect DVD or video games console to the TV for the rare moment you want to stay in and watch movies, their restaurant only serves breakfast, the rooms have 2 queen sized HARD beds (king size is not an option). All in all, our stay was overall OK but could be better. We won't be staying here on our next OC excursion.",
            "Very nice hotel and friendly people. Nice and clean rooms. The bathrooms however, are SO tiny it is very hard to get around in them. The one thing I very much dislike are the balconies. There is absolutely no privacy on them. They have bars up that separates them and they do that so you get the most out of your view but like i said, there is just no privacy. I don't want to go out and sit there with my neighbors looking right at me!! That is my one major complaint about this hotel. Everything else was very nice.",
            "Just got back from oc. I really liked this hotel the rooms and hotel were very clean and the staff very friendly and nice. We had a room on the side and still had a great view of the ocean. I also liked the 24 hour coffee shop. What i did not like is that you could not bring your own drinks and snacks to the pool they did have a bar at the pool which was way overpriced after all you are on vacation you should be able to relax and enjoy yourself at the pool. the only other thing i wish they had was a hot tub that would be perfect",
            "We spent the weekend at The Grand Hotel this past weekend and it couldn't have been better. Service was excellent, the room was very clean, the view was unbeatable, and the staff couldn't do enough for us. We will be staying there again soon.",
            "For the 5th year in a row we have stayed at the Stowaway Grand Hotel. It is a great place to stay. The design of the hotel is such that almost every room has a wonderful ocean view. The only down sides are that it is very pricey and the cleaning service could do a little better job. Here's a tip..instead of getting reservations - just show up. We did and saved $100.00 per night!",
            "My husband and I just returned from a short jaunt to OC We stayed at the Grand Hotel and Spa. We had a marvelous time! The hotel is located on the boardwalk and has everything you'll need for your stay. We enjoyed the whirlpool tub in our room and the small kitchenette. We had a great view of the Atlantic Ocean and the beach. There is an indoor and outdoor pool, bars, and a spa. The beach was very clean, unlike many years ago. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",
            "Very clean and large rooms with awesome views from the balcony. Front desk staff was extremely helpfull and courteous. The hotel is a great location on boardwalk and only steps away from the ocean. Rooms were great with the kitchenette and queen size beds were very comfortable. This was our first stay at the Grand and will definately choose this location in the future. Pools were clean, restaurant was great and was nice having parking so convenient. We have stayed at other hotels on boardwalk but none compare to the quality,service,price and location of the Grand. AAA +++",
            "The hotel is clean, most of the rooms have a good to exellent view of the ocean, well located. The rooms themselves will need an upgrade soon. it sems as the sliding doors to the balcony all need to be serviced or repaired. My biggest problem with the Stowaway Grand is tuesday nights when they rent out the meeting room and turn it into a nightclub with extremly loud Bass that reverberates thru the hotel into all the adjoing floors until 3 am. if for any reason you wake up ,its enough to keep most people awake until they are done. the staff is very apologetic and claim there is nothing that can be done. The manager reduced my rate for that nite because I complained. I believe that if the hotel continually loses money on tues nites the management may finally get rid of the tues nite loudness. My belief is that waking guests up for something like this is one of the cardinal sins of the hotel business. We were woken up at other times the same week by the fire alarm, twice in one nite. this not being the hotels fault. once was someone smoking ciggarettes in the room. I believe they recieved a 500 dollar fine and the major cause of fire alarm emergencies would be improper use of the microwave ovens. it seems to me that someone would really have to be a bad cook to set off the fire alarm with a microwave but they claim thats there number 1 problem. Other than these problems the hotel has the potential to be real nice place, I just wish they could fix those problems and this could be a real top notch hotel in Ocean City Md.",
            "We got an ocean view room with two double beds. It was one of the most SPACIOUS rooms we have gotten in an oceanfront hotel! You could easily fit a queen air mattress on the floor and have tons of space. There was also a kitchenette with a medium-sized fridge. Beds were comfortable, and on the main floor of the hotel were several shops and restaurants. Best of all, it was right on the beach and boardwalk! It is a bit away from the main attractions of the boardwalk, but there is a tram that comes every 15 mins for $3 a ride (exact change only). The outdoor pool was LOVELY, even though there were a LOT of small children. The staff sets up chairs for you, with towel service. There is also an indoor pool open till 11pm. They were also willing to give us as many parking passes as we needed. Great place to stay with friends!",
            "We visit Ocean City every Summer at least once, and have found the Stoaway Grand to be the best bang for the buck. Great location - on the boardwalk away from main traffic, but close enough for easy walk to amusement area. Always pretty clean and convenient inc. a 24 hour coffee shop downstairs. Although It is nice to see new top end hotels going in like the Hilton and Marriott - I just can't justify spending $ 429.00 and up to stay at one of them at Ocean City ! We payed $ 200 a night this week - it goes up a bit in July and August., but not much. Great parking too, a huge parking garage just steps away from front door, something many don't have. We will continue to go to the Grand every time !",
            "it's got it all...pool, shops, restaurant, coffee shop, quiet end of boardwalk location, great views from oceanfront rooms. Rooms on 11th Fl were clean and very comfy. Oh, they have a pool bar too. I will stay again.",
            "Actually I'm here right now and all I can say is do not come here memorial weekend it's gang weekend and not a place for young kids we haven't sleep in two days cause they take over the whole hotel wit there loud music and there loins bikes and I guess the managment doesn't care cause they rent out like 50 rooms first time here n probably last such a shame'!!! !",
            "This hotel has seen better days. It sits on prime beachfront property, yet no money has been put back into the building itself. The rooms are large, very DARK, so dark it was hard to see to iron my clothing. Dark red carpet (stained), very dark furniture (from the 80's) and dark red and green comforters on the beds, makes it so gloomy! The price refects the shape of the property. There is a new Hilton right down the road that was 289.00 per night during this same week and the rate here was about 100 bucks, my vote, pay the extra for the name brand hotel. This property is in sad shape, I just went to the 6th floor to check out the \"shipwreck\" restaurant, it was closed, and through the door, I could see dirt on the floor and a broken glass window inside, yes, a shipwreck.",
            "We stayed on the 9th floor for a long weekend in January. The hotel was clean, the room was clean and we had a great view of the ocean. We loved the extra features of the hotel, like the Shipwreck Lounge, Ice Cream/Coffee Shop, pool and the other shops. Staying here is like staying at a mini all inclusive hotel. Ideas for improvements would be: It would have been nice to have a couch in our room so that we could sit and drink coffee while viewing the ocean (we had dbl queen beds and a small table with chairs. There is 1 other chair (at the desk) in the room. The room sleeps 4 but only has 3 chairs, so someone had to sit on the bed to eat, talk, relax, etc. Couch and cozy chair would have made it much nicer. Another suggestion would be to upgrade to a flat screen tv. Our tv was small and the picture is not as clear as HD. Also, it would have been nice to have some basic dishes, silverware and napkins in the kitchen area. When we went to get ice cream, almost all of the flavors were empty, so we really only had a choice of 3 flavors. Hand lotion would be a great plus in the ladies room! Also, the stores were not open during our stay. It was super nice having the parking garage!!! We enjoyed not having to worry about parking. We do plan on coming back, but would love to see some upgrades as this could really be a SUPER hotel. Thank you.",
            "We had a really nice time. Room was decent, check in was easy. They originally offered the 3rd floor, but when we requested a higher floor, they did their best to accomodate us and we got the 8th floor (which had a great view). We got there before check in and were able to park, use the pool and enjoy the day. Asked for extra pillows and got them right away. Location was perfect. Pizza place around the corner had a lot to be desired (would not recommend it). Loved Fish Tails, which was just a few blocks over. Beach was awesome. Saw tons of dolphins. Pool was nice too. Would definitely go back.",
            "We stayed at the Grand Aug 19-21 and had a nice room on the 6th floor. The room was very spacious, large bathroom, and nice area outside of the bathroom with \"kitchen sink\", countertop, cabinets, and microwave. This was an unexpected plus since we had our 7month old baby with us. We had no real complaints about the place, except for the food at the breakfast restaurant. The spa service (massage) was excellent, and the hotel location is good as well. Our friend was in a room on the 2nd floor, and while the size was the same, her room was tiled, and not carpeted like ours upstairs. I did prefer the carpet. Her view was the roof of the stores below, so definitely higher is better. When she complained at the desk, they told her it was b/c she did not book directly through the hotel (she used Orbitz, just as the others in our parties did), and there was nothing they could do about it b/c they were filled to capacity. She was not amused by their reasoning. The rest of us who used Orbitz were on the 6th floor and had no problems. For Ocean City, I think The Grand is worth serious consideration.",
            "I have stayed at The Grand Hotel several times. I love staying here because of the day spa conveniently located in the lobby. Each visit I stayed in the king/jacuzzi tub room - oceanfront, of course. I love going downstairs and getting a massage by Karen. She is GREAT! She remembers me each visit and welcomes me with a warm smile. I have been all over town getting massages and she is the BEST! I highly recommend a stay here and a visit to the salon/day spa!",
            "My husband and I stayed at the Grand for our 30th anniversary last month and our experience could not have been better. For years, we have tried to include massages into our OC trips without success. When I saw the Romance Package (jacuzzi in the room, dinner voucher at choice of 4 restaurants and massages right in the hotel spa), we went for it. What a great deal!! Room was beautiful and squeaky clean. Staff was very courteous and helpful. They called our room approx. 2 hours after we checked in to ask if we had everything we needed. (That was a first for me!) The view from the room was stunning and you are right on the boardwalk. The spa staff was friendly & highly-skilled. The only negative for us was the fact that the restaurant is closed in the off-season. Overall, it was the weekend we have been trying to have for years. We have already booked our next trip for October.",
            "Good staff, lots of amenities. B U T... Where there would normally be a sofa or an easy chair with a lamp, there was a great big space! I went to the desk to inquire about the policy of no comfortable chair. She said each room was the same. I found that hard to believe. I told her that I have been all over the world and have never seen a hotel room without some kind of chair to relax and read the paper. Next day, I peeked in some other rooms being cleaned. She was right. This may be a petty nit pick but I was very dissatisfied. These folks charge up to $329 per night for the room I was in. Disclaimer, I stayed off season rate of $100. My bottom line, never again",
            "I stayed at the Hotel on fourth of July even though it was full house they manage to keep it clean planty of parking friendly staff, conveniently lacated, with sliding doors closed you don't hear a thing of whats going on outside. This was my first time at hotel and I'll be back, more than I can say about other hotels in Ocean City.I stayed there once i don't come back many hotels in Ocean City have rude employees,",
            "If you are looking for a place to stay in OC that has your best interests at heart, don't stay at the Grand Hotel on 21 street. We stayed there for Memorial weekend and it was a disaster! A motorcycle association and church group were staying there at the same time. Don't mind bikers, don't mind churches, do mind loud music 24-7 and the all night party the hotel and city aloud in their garage parking, by-the-way, can't park out front of the hotel. Woudl NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone! Would only give a \"below expectations\" rating if there were one. I hope everyone reads my review before they book here!",
            "Never in my life have I experienced such rude and ignorant service but any member in the hospitality industry - especially by the front desk Manager - Nina. The hotel booked my reservation for the wrong date, refused to give me a refund, and made my group pay full price for an extra night. The staff at this hotel cannot be trusted and are borderline scam artists. They are rude and do not understand any aspect of the hospitality industry. Also, if you are looking to stay at a hotel close to Seacrets - this is not it. I will never stay at this hotel again and I urge you to do the same.",
            "For a beach town, this hotel was definitely good. My family just stayed there this past 4th of July week and got a 5 day special for the week, so the rates were good. There are no 4 or 5 star hotels in OC so this was better then what I expected. Location wise, it's right on the boardwalk but not in the heart of the activity, which is good because you don't get the noise of the crowds and events. The rooms were large enough for a family of 4. However, the windows on the sliders to the balcony overlooking the beach were foggy. They really need to clean them regularly because of all the salt water residue from being on the beach. When we had them try and clean them, it would not come clean at all. Also they really need to dust the lampshades! The amount of dust that came off the lampshade when it was accidentally brushed into created a cloud of dust. The bathrooms are tiny and the knob to turn the water on in the shower fell off, but we easily popped that back on. Lastly, we ate in their restaurant for breakfast on the first morning there. It took an hour before the got our food served, for breakfast! We went down the street to Sahara Cafe for breakfast each morning after that, for much better service and food. Otherwise the staff was friendly and helpful, both at the front desk, and the pool. I would stay here again."

            "We stayed at Le Saint Sulpice for 3 nights. We got in very late, (12 am), the first night & were greeted by two very nice & helpful staff members. Anything we needed the staff would immediately accommodate us & they also had great suggestions on where to go for entertainment, etc. The food in the restaurant was incredible, the chocolate torte was most delectable and the waiter, Martine, never rushed us, even after the restaurant was closed; although, the maitre de was not so friendly, he was actually very rude both times we tried to dine there. The rooms were so comfortable with a goose down comforter and big bathroom. My room had a balcony & living room which was great since we were traveling with friends; when they came over we could \"entertain\" in our suite. I loved the location because we were a step a way from everything...we did so much walking. The jazz festival was 5 blocks north, the port was one block south and touristy stuff was a few blocks away. I had a great time & would definitely stay there again.",
            "My boyfriend and I decided to visit old Montreal for the weekend and I found great reviews about this hotel. It definitely did not dissappoint! The staff were extremely friendly and always willing to help. The hotel was very clean and we ended up getting a free upgrade to a suite. The bed was very comfortable! We are definitely coming back to this hotel when we visit in the summer. Highly recommended!",
            "My stay at this hotel was simply wonderful. I loved the decor of the lobby and the friendly service upon checking in. I arrived around 10:30pm and needed a dining suggestion and the lady at the front desk gave me a nice place to dine about five minutes by foot. This historical section of Montreal is worth the stay. The architecture and history are very interesting. I had a delicious breakfast every morning by room service. Always arrived on time. The room itself is very spacious with a large bathroom and a great view overlooking the main street. My interactions with the staff to be very friendly and ready to help me when I needed it. The Concierge were especially helpful with directions and suggestions for dinner and sightseeing. I highly recommend staying here. Not many hotels in Montreal are as charming as this place.",

            "This is a very late review and is coming on the heels of some terrible service at another hotel. This bad experience had me thinking \"jeez, these guys need to learn a little customer service from..... and Woila...Le Saint Sulpice popped in my mind. I was traveling on business for what turned out to be a difficult customer install which left me stressed out at the end of every day. So it was great to come back to a very welcoming staff and clean elegant room everyday. With a great neighborhood full of shops, restaurants , and art galleries I never had to venture far if I didn't want to. Then there is the beautiful church right on the corner along with the charming narrow cobblestone streets which made you really feel like you were in \"Old World\" Montreal. On top of the great ambience, the service I received was the best. I had arrived during hockey playoffs and was intent on watching my favorite team being a die hard team. Cruising the channels I couldn't find it and was scrambling to figure out what station it might be on. Not knowing the stations in Canada, I called down to the front desk. The desk immediately sent some one up( someone into sports) and they went through all the channels with me and when we couldn't find it, he then used the internet to verify what station it should've been on(which it wasn;t) after apologizing for something that was beyond his control, I thanked him and proceeded to stew about not being able to watch. Ten minutes later, he comes back up and had found a canadian site streaming the game online. I promptly found the site and ended up happily watching the game. While this may seem trivial, to me it was going the extra mile as he saw how p***** off I was. They were also great with tips on restaurants, directions etc. I gladly recommend this place and look forward to bringing the wife back for a romantic trip.",

We were very pleased with the hotel. The front staff were exceptionally friendly and efficient. The lobby had a European charm, and the our room was very comfortable and modern-looking. (Although it was quite cozy for us, with a rambunctious toddler and a baby.) The hotel was very quiet, which was appreciated! The complimentary Internet service and nightly bottled water service were nice touches. The included continental breakfast was also good. The restaurant had excellent food at dinner, including a children's menu, although the service was average. The location can't be beat \u00e2\u20ac\u201d adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica and very close to lots of lovely restaurants throughout Old Montreal.",
            "We just returned from 3 wonderful nights at the Saint Sulpice. We splurged for the mid-priced suite and weren't dissapointed. We had a large living room and bedroom, the bathroom was very large with a great tub and walk-in shower. Service was excellent, I broke the hairdryer in the middle of drying my hair before we were going out to dinner, and in less than 5 minutes they brought me a new one. Great location -- very short walk to the Metro. Only thing that needs improvement is the \"gym\". Outdated treadmills and very dark gym room. Other than that, I highly, highly recommend.",
            "From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I knew I had picked the right place for my weekend stay. The staff was warm and friendly, the concierge was incredibly helpful, and within 30 minutes after I'd entered my room, a staff member was already at my door to offer free water and see if everything was okay. The bed was incredibly soft and comfy, and the bathroom had both a shower and large tub, along with ample toilette space in the middle for all of my things. On top of all that, the room itself was gigantic - probably bigger than a studio apartment. The hotel is indeed right in the heart of Old Montreal, literally just behind the Notre Dame Cathedral and only a few blocks from a Metro stop. Extremely convenient, warm, friendly and efficient - would definitely stay over and over again!",

Plenty of room to spread out. No complaints. Fold out couch was comfortable and spacious. Thanks Snique Away.",
            "Really, a wonderful hotel. In four nights we kept waiting to find SOMETHING that would disappoint us, but never did. From the first Bon jour! as we pulled up out front, we were greeted time and again not with a robotic mumble but with a genuinely warm greeting, as if from old friends. Lobby was stylish without being weird, as was most of Montreal. Comfortable, relaxed. And the room - mon dieu! (Pardon the attempts at french - Montreal will do that to you!) Absolutely gorgeous suite with entrance including closet and a wonderfully handy little table to drop your keys, maps, change etc, then a well equipped kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, stove, etc. Incidentally, we have stayed at some 5 star resorts (when we can catch a great bargain) all over North America and never before have we had a full sized coffee maker with TEN cups of great french roast every morning. Anway, from the kitchenette you enter the living room with a pull out couch, fireplace, and flat screen tv. Separate bedroom had a wonderfully comfortable bed with thick down comforter and another flat screen. With doors to bedroom closed was as quiet as our own country home - we slept like babies! Bathroom was beautiful with luxurious towels, great soaps and lotions, very elegant glass sink and extra large (two person!) shower stall/deep bath tub. Location is just behind the extraordinary Notre-Dame cathedral, in the heart of Old Montreal, with tons of stuff immediately nearby and a subway station two blocks away. I swear if I could have justified it, I would have made reservations for our next stay when I was checking out this last time!",
            "My husband and I stayed at the Sulpice after Christmas through the New Year and were absolutely in love with it! We were given an upgraded room because it was our honeymoon so we had a huge room with fireplace, balcony (winter so not really useful), a separate bedroom, separate shower with huge soaker tub and a very well stocked kitchenette. The service was absolutely unbeatable....the staff were always polite, helpful and very prompt if we needed wood, towels or reservations. We were surprised with a unique New Years Gift and were always delighted with the turn down service with weather report in the evenings! The free breakfast was okay, we prefer Eggspectations, but free is free! We did not eat in the restaurant for dinner, but heard others rave about it. We also used the massage therapists in the gym and both my husband and I had amazing massages that were well worth the money. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the Sulpice and would stay there again, actually we are planning our next trip to Montreal already!",
            "This was our first visit to Montreal and we chose Le Saint Sulpice based on the glowing tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed! Our room was actually a small apartment--separate bedroom, living room w/electric fireplace, kitchenette, balcony overlooking the outdoor dining area and gardens and a large, extremely well appointed bath. Grohe fixtures, a beautiful molded glass vanity, large tub and an enormous shower. There was plenty of closet and drawer space, the furnishings were very nice and the queen bed was comfortable with high quality linens. As a coffee addict, I especially appreciated a large, 12 cup coffee maker supplied with a more than acceptable blend--no tiny pot dribbling out foul brown water like most hotels. The location of the hotel is superb--right next to Notre Dame, an easy walk to the Metro and in the heart of Old Montreal. My only quibbles: some of the walls were scarred in places and in need of repair and paint and the carpet was stained and frayed in spots. As a previous reviewer noted, pets are allowed in some of the rooms and I suspect the carpet issues can be attributed to that. All in all--a very pleasant experience in a wonderfully unique city.",

This place was worth splurging on... an amazing weekend.",
            "I found it to be quite a rip-off. Nothing looked like the pictures the hotel website provided. Everything looked smaller. My room was supposed to be a non-smoking room but when I walked in, I smelled cigarettes. The staff tried to get rid of it by bringing in this ozone machine thing. The smell did go away but came back the next morning. That's when I realized that the smell came from the outside. Not only the smell penetrated the window so did the noise from car. However, there is one good thing about this room. It has a really nice gorgeous bathroom.",
            "We stayed at the St. Sulpice from June 26 - 28. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Our deluxe suite had a sitting area with pull-out queen and a small bedroom with frosted french doors - this provided some but not complete privacy. The suite was appointed exactly as you would expect for a boutique hotel. It was perfect for our family of four including one teenager. Plenty of storage for clothes.The rooms were very clean and best of all very quiet - there was no noise from above, the street or the hallway - the room doors are recessed slightly and this may have helped. Our room faced St. Paul Street, which tended to be very quiet from 9 p.m. on and then into mid-morning. There was a building being renovated directly across the street so it did not make for the best view but overall was charming. The location is excellent. It is a block or so away from the very commercial and touristy section of St. Paul and you can easily walk to area restaurants and attractions. If you walk down St. Paul's in the opposite direction you come across more boutique type shops and less touristy places to eat along with art galleries. The breakfast was just so-so. Skip it and go to Claude Postel, one block away or Olive and Gourmando two blocks down St. Paul. The work-out room was small but suitable. The staff were very eager to assist and provided great service. The valet was very timely and pleasant. The front desk folks did give us a few vague directions and some incomplete information but otherwise were great. We attended an Alsace wine tasting in the garden - which was so pleasant - it is too bad they do not serve breakfast out there - it is also fun for an after dinner drink. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",
            "My family and I recently visited the hotel and we were very disappointed at the quality of service of the hotel. This is our fifth visit to Old Montreal, we absolutely love the city and the sites. Upon our arrival to the hotel we approached the concierge to check in and was brushed off by one of the staff \"alain\" who told us to wait for his colleague to help us. He clearly was not busy but for some reason didn't have to time for us. The staff are not friendly, we have been to other hotels in Old Montreal and they are always smiling, saying hello and always willing to help and suggest places for us to go. When returning back to our rooms, none of the staff including the concierge would acknowledge us or even smile or say hello. The room was decent but not what you would expect for the price you pay. The sofa bed was absolutely terrible, the mattress was old and uncomfortable. The breakfast selection is poor to say the least. There are no eggs (extra charge), 5 slices of cold meats, small variety of fruit, cheese and toast. I've been to other hotels with a much better selection of french pastries, fruit, eggs, cheeses, etc. Upon checking out we were never asked about how we enjoyed our stay and were charged for items at breakfast without the staff telling us about it Overall we would never go back! What a shame especially for the ridiculous amount they charge.",
            "Everything was fantastic during each of my stays or visits to this hotel ! I went there a dozen of times last year for business cocktails as well as for a birthday party in a suite of the hotel. I can sincerely say that I was impressed by their team, the location, the bar and the rooms ! Nothing to complain about, we were always in for quite an experience ! This boutique hotel is one of the finest in Montreal. In the heart of the Old Montreal, a few minutes away from the business center as well as the Port of Montreal, business men and families alike will find a great value. I definitely recommend it ! !",
            "We were extremely pleased with our stay at this hotel. We were travelling with our young child and the staff was fantastic at accommodating every need. We booked a superior room and it was HUGE and lovely - there was even a mini-kitchen with a microwave and 2 burner stovetop! One recommendation that I would make if booking this hotel, would be to make sure that you arrange for a room on the second floor or above, it's a very well travelled street and you would get a lot of noise at street level. We had an excellent experience and would stay there again in a heartbeat!",
            "My husband and I traveled to Montreal in late April because he was attending a conference which was located at Saint-Sulpice Hotel. We decided to add a few extra days to explore Montreal since we had never been there before and spent six nights at Saint-Sulpice. We found that the hotel was in the perfect location in Old Montreal, literally around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica, about two blocks from a Metro station, and just off Rue Saint-Paul, which is the oldest and most charming street in Old Montreal. There were so many sights, shops, galleries and restaurants within easy walking distance. We were very pleased with this hotel. Our room was spacious with a kitchenette, living room, desk with wireless Internet, and a large bathroom with a shower and soaking tub. We also had a small balcony that overlooked a courtyard. Our bedroom was a separate, small room and I was surprised how quiet it was---we slept well. We were also at the end of the hallway, so we did not have many shared walls. The decor was more contemporary than traditional. My only complaint is that the carpet was a little bit worn and puckered in our room, but otherwise we were very pleased. A continental breakfast was included in our room. It was fine but nothing special, as continental breakfasts usually are. We did not eat any other meals at the hotel, although they have a nice courtyard cafe that would be enjoyable in warmer weather. We found the staff to be friendly and polite. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, particularly if your budget is less of a concern.",
            "We had the good fortune to stay two nights this February while visiting family in Montreal. We loved the service provided by the door and desk staff that greeted us each time we came and went. The guest rooms are luxurious and very well appointed with comfortable furniture. Our room could sleep six with a murphy bed, pullout and queen bed in the bedroom. There was a kitchen for preparing light meals so we kept the beer and wine chilled and popped some popcorn one night snuggling in for a movie. I couldn't get over how sound proof the rooms are....I heard not a pipe,voice, or car muffler throughout our entire stay.... we had amazing sleeps. We loved visiting the church next door - and how close great restaurants, shops and people watching locals were. With everything we needed within walking distance, we parked the car upon arrival and left it in the garage until departure three days later. We'll be back in warmer weather to see much more of Old Montreal.",
            "We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel--staff was helpful ! Room was comfortable. Good central location mid in the romantic old Montreal, close to great restaurants and easy to get around town. Concierge helpful in arranging side trips and restaurant recommendations. All in all a good stay",
            "Just got back from a 5 day stay at Le Saint-Sulpice, and couldn't be happier with the hotel. The staff was very accommodating and friendly and it was wonderful to come back what is basically an apartment instead of a bedroom with a chair or two. The hotel is perfectly located in old Montreal down the block from Notre Dame and within a short walk of the downtown area. Breakfast was ample, it included fruit, cereal, yogurt, cheeses, croissants, sweet rolls, toast, nuts juices, and coffee or tea, if you wanted an American breakfast including eggs, bacon and potatoes it was $7.00 extra. We certainly enjoyed Montreal, there was a lot to do and the people there were exceptionally friendly.",
            "We stayed at Le Saint-Sulpice for 6 nights with our 19 month old daughter. Having a toddler it was important to stay in a hotel with a separate bedroom as well as kitchen facilities. I would definately reccommend Le Saint-Sulpice for this! Great spacious, clean rooms with fabulous facilities. We got one with a terrace and had dinner outside most nights. The location of the hotel is also fantastic. Right in the old town of Montreal with cobbled streets, restaurants and a childrens playground at the old Port. There is also a fantastic childrens day nursery with spa facilities for parents about a 20 minute walk down Rue Notre Dame called Parentheses Montreal. A MUST for anyone with kids! The only dissappointment was the hotel restaurant where we had breakfast each morning. Since we stayed for 6 nights it shouldn't have been a surprise that we wanted a high-chair each morning but unfortunately we had to ask every day and they would have to go and fetch a usually soaking wet chair (left out in the rain all night!) which they would then dry and give to us for the baby. We would have to beg for coffee and butter for our toast - usually got it after about 3 requests. Also, the breakfast was the same for all 6 days! Not even a change of yoghurt choice or fruit.Not what I'd expect from a 4 star hotel. We also ordered room service (which comes from the hotel restaurant). We ordered chicken for our daughter which was undercooked when it arrived. Since she was so hungry we didnt send it back but microwaved it to ensure it was fully cooked. It was also overcharged on the room service bill. When we complainted to the restaurant manager he refused to belive it had been undercooked and said that the chicken they use sometimes looks rose coloured when cooked and then went into detailed explanations about their cooking techniques! For $22 I'd expect fully cooked chicken! In summary - fantastic hotel but avoid the restaurant.",
            "Can't say anything negative, arrived at midnight, the girl at the front desk was happy and ready to check me in. I received an upgrade, the room was huge! the bed was so comfortable I nearly did not want to leave to go sightseeing! Great Location, walking distance to many shops, restaurants and smack bang in the middle of the old town. They price is actually well worth it, and you can't say that about many places these days! If I am ever back in Montreal I now know where to go!",
            "Great hotel with very big rooms and an excellent location. If you stay anywhere in Montreal you want to stay in Old Montreal and Le Saint-Sulpice is an excellent choice. The staff was friendly, the room was very big with a separate bedroom, big bathroom and the hotel is in the middle of old Montreal. We would stay again.",
            "We stayed here for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon in July. The suite was lovely - and huge as well. Very modern but yet comfortable, and the rest of the hotel was equally lovely. My husband made full use of the gym and thought is was better than a lot of hotel gyms but I have to say that the spa wasn't really worth that much of a look. This is a great place to stay for a weekend break and an ideal base for exploring the city. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",
            "Excellent service with a real smile, at the desk, for breakfast and at the door. In the heart of old town Montreal, next to the Cathedral close to most restaurants. The rooms have a large bed and a good quality pullout for a family. The lofty shape is trendy, allows for light to enter the room, but does not have some level of privacy for a family. A kitchenette may be handy for some, but could have done without.",
            "This is a lovely hotel in the Old Port, a great section of Montreal. An inviting and elegant lobby. Very easy access to Metro (you can get absolutely anywhere on the Metro), and close to many shops and restaurants. The Saint Sulpice has a very helpful staff who recommend places to eat, give great directions and are fairly quick to respond to requests. The only problem we had was our TV remote control didn't work (horrors!) and they never got around to replacing it. Great bathroom with separate shower and wonderful toiletries (L'Occitaine). One note is that, in our room, the shower had a frosted glass wall that was visible in the room, so if anyone was talking a shower, their silhouette was there for all to see. With small children it would be very embarrassing. For a couple traveling together, maybe not so embarrassing!",
            "My husband and I just returned from an overnighter at Le Saint Sulpice and cannot say enough great things about it. We have already recommended it to all our friends. Our Loft Suite was very spacious, immaculate, wonderfully decorated with European simplicity and taste, and made for an awesome stay. The leather loveseat and chair were new and comfortable. The full kitchenette with refrigerator, stove and sink was great - we could not remember staying EVER at any hotel that included REAL glasses (water, cocktail AND wine glasses). What a treat. The queen bed with down comforter was scrumptious. The faux fireplace was a nice touch. The balcony would have been phenom if it had been summer! The bathroom was huge, with ceramic tile, a large soaking tub, large tile shower, and beautiful glass vanity. The toiletries and robes were also top notch. The staff was incredibly gracious, and we felt very pampered and taken care of - from the valet parking to the moment we left. The location is superb, right in the heart of old Montreal, and walking distance to all the great restaurants and the port. We will not consider staying anywhere else in Montreal, and will definitely be back again and again. Perhaps next time we will try massages at the Spa! Thanks to all the staff for our wonderful stay - and we can't wait to return!",
            "We love to visit Old Montreal always something happening in this beautiful city. Our favourite hotel is Le Saint-Sulpice Suites, first class from the minute you pull the car up to the door. Valet service on arrival, smiling staff everywhere, fast check-in, bags arrived to our room in a flash and our one bedroom suite was spacious, comfortable and very cozy with a gas fireplace. Very clean and we appreciated the cooking facilities which we used for breakfast. Located close to the convention center we used the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underground city\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to walk uptown and do some shopping ok alot!.. :) Back at the hotel we went down to the bar for a cocktail before we headed out for supper, there are so many good restaurants just take your pick. We saw John Malkowich who was staying at the hotel for a movie production called Warm Bodies.",
            "This hotel was lovely and very accommodating. It is located in Vieux Montreal which is a good tourist destination to stay in. The hotel is surrounded by art galleries, tourist shops, and restaurants which offer table d'hote meals where you can get an appetizer, entree, drink, and dessert for one price. Le Saint Sulpice is also by the water which is a nice area to stroll through. In addition, the hotel is located a few blocks from the Metro which can get you downtown. In my opinion, the only 2 places to stay in Montreal when visiting would be either the old town or downtown. The suite, I stayed in a deluxe suite, was nice and luxurious. My only complaint would be the size of the room for the bedroom which was a little small, but then again you're just sleeping in that room. Also, in the living room area, I had to stand up closer to the television for the remote control to work. I stayed on the first floor which was kinda strange since the outdoor dining service was outside my window. A white curtain blocked the inside view of my suite, but it was strange to not have the curtain opened most of the time. I enjoyed staying at this hotel despite the mediocre free breakfast which charged $4+ for hot food such as bacon and ham which weren't even cooked that well. The service is good though especially if you're only fluent in English, like myself. The staff was courteous and very helpful.",
            "We recently traveled to Montreal on vacation with our teenager, and this hotel was recommended to us by friends who had stayed there previously. Although the room with our bed was quite tight, it was great to have a set up where our teenager could have her own space. The location can't be beat, the hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the continental breakfast included was good, although repetitive after 4 days. The croissants were outstanding, and breakfast is served in a nice outside courtyard. The concierge, bartender and desk staff were very helpful with directions and recommendations. When we checked in late at night, the person at the counter had not given us the correct amount of breakfast passes, suggesting that I speak with the manager in the morning. When I went to do so the next morning, the woman there had already been informed and had the breakfast passes ready for us. I didn't even have to go into explaining it. The location is in old Montreal, and the perfect location from which to explore the city. The only time we took our car out was to travel to La Ronde. I was so glad we had chosen to stay there, and have already started recommending it to anyone else traveling with a family to Montreal. We enjoyed staying here better than the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec (we had one room, not a suite there)! I only wish I had remembered to take the book which has all of the hotels in the group they belong to, of which all are suite hotels!",
            "Great hotel, the rooms are spacious and furnished nicely. The hotel is not much for night life as for the bar, but everything is just a walk or metro ride away. Old Montreal is where it is located and it is awesome, lovely views and so many little places to walk into for coffee, dinner, or wine. The staff were helpful and eager to assist and were not looking for tips all the time. Typically we stay at Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton. This hotel is our choice for Montreal. People said the Murphy bed was not comfortable, but we slept perfect. Bathroom is large and plently of room for things on the counter and such. Nice touch also to have great huge windows that open for fresh air.",
            "My husband and our friends spent New Years weekend here and I must say I do not see why everyone is giving this hotel such good reviews. Yes the rooms are nice and spacious, but that is the only thing that is nice about this place. The food was not good, it was not fresh, and tasted as if it was sitting out for hours before it was brought out to our table. The service was not the service of a 4star hotel. We had a mix-up with our suites, and were told that one of them was canceled; we did not get any apologies and were told that if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have cancellations we would just have to deal with it and share one suite, which was okay considering they gave us an upgrade to a bigger room, but they did not give us any extra towels, toiletries, or pillows needed for four people\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6even after I called and requested it, it was still never sent to us. My overall experience was not a positive one therefore I would not be coming back to this hotel. However, you get what you pay for and this hotel was not at all expansive considering the room size and the hotel location, plus they give you free breakfast, which was not bad. Another thing the hotel needs is a lounge or a bar, they have about five chairs at the restaurant bar. which is not sufficient for a hotel this size, and a little shop where guests can get things like coffe, soda. or meds without having to leave the hotel.",
            "Perhaps we'd been spoilt by the fabulous Auberge Saint Aintoine in Quebec City, but the Saint Sulpice was a little bit of a disappointment. It's location is excellent, but the room we were given (which we subsequently discovered to be one of the smallest in the hotel) was hardly the \"loft siuite\" it claimed to be. In fact it was not a suite at all - just one room - and given that the TV was opposite the bed rather than the sofa you couldn't even pretend it was a suite. The bed itself folded down from the wall, which wasn't in itself much of a problem (other than having to clamber in over a large frame) but it was rather bizarre. However, our biggest gripe was the restaurant where almost unbelievably they allow smoking in all areas - I was just amazed by this. Also, they short-changed me on both occasions we ate there; once could be a mistake, but twice... Perhaps I'm being fussy but I expect better at these prices.",
            "My wife and I -- 2 middle class Americans with modest travel experience -- recently stayed here for a long weekend. We were attracted by the outside courtyard and the many excellent reviews. We were not disappointed. We were treated superbly by all staff members, the hotel is beautiful and unique, and the courtyard is a terrific place to enjoy a bottle of wine, a glass of beer, a Cuban cigar, whatever. The hotel is a great mix of the old and the contemporary, and we really loved just laying around the room. Some people suggest Claude Postel for breakfast -- be aware that they have moved and I am not certain it is the right choice unless you are looking for pastries. Our friends gushed about Bonapartes for lunch but we went for dinner and found the place staid. So lunch would be the better choice and we do trust their call. Perhaps the true highlight of the trip was our dinner at Ferreira's, a Portuguese place. Pricey but worth every penny. I started with grilled octopus and went for the fruits de mer -- wow! and I am not even a big fish eater. My wife had a salted blackened cod -- again, blew us away. The staff was great and the ambiance upscale hip but not pretentious or uncomfortable in any way. (We are not hip or upscale!) If you are looking for solid bistro food near the hotel, we liked Holder's. Also contemporary. Not fabulous, but an enjoyable experience and very convenient to the hotel's location. If you are ever thinking you deserve a splurge, this may well be the place.",
            "I was disappointed after reading the tripadvisor reviews because I was expecting something out of this world. This is a nice high end hotel. Things were clean, things looked pretty, and things were safe. It was nice. It wasnt cozy or unique or romantic. The bathroom had a walk in shower and a tub which we liked. The bedroom was set apart from the living room which would be nice for parents so they could close the doors while the kids sleep in the living room I suppose. There was a mini kitchen area where we made breakfast. The concierge downstairs helped us decide where to go to dinner and made reservations. All in all, it was a nice high end hotel. It was quite large so it did not feel initimate but it was nice. The location is nice as it is right around the corner from Notre Dame and across the street from a cupcake shop and a tea shop. There were a few restaurants walking distance. Would work well for business travel as well.",
            "Arrived on 11/23, late in the day (for me) and tired. First room they had us checked into had red carpet stains. Second room they put us in was on ground floor right next to outside terrace. Murphy bed was lowered by staff so didn't notice the dried orange fluid (orange juice/vomit?) on the frame of the murphy bed until the next morning. Yuck! Place is nice but not spectacular, for the amt of $, if you can get another hotel w/a WARM breakfast take it. Their breakfast is a choice of 3 cereals, 3 types of cold pastries, dried fruit and yogurt). The concierges: Maxim, Etienne and Alan were very informative. Housekeeper Guadalupe was very sweet. Overall nice stay, but not something to rage about. Next time, I'll try a different place. Definitely recommend you check out the room, even under the sheets, before accepting it. Also, on the Friday nite that we were there the downstairs bar hosted a very loud party which went on until the wee morning hours. I was awoken at 4 am by people smoking and laughing loudly in the outside terrace. If business travel is what you are after, you may want to opt for a quieter place. Although the staff were very apologetic to the hotel guests the next morning, that wasn't going to replace the sleep everyone had lost the nite before. It should be noted that the entire hotel only has ONE pc for internet access and it's in the lobby next to the valet, no privacy and sometimes you have to queue up to use it. Last note: The murphy bed is located next to the kitchenette. I am a light sleeper and was awoken on the 2nd nite by a dripping noise that resembled Chinese torture. I turned on the fan to muffle the sound and woke up with a sore throat the next day. I couldn't locate the origin of the drops, but definitely don't stay in room #120 if you're a light sleeper.",
            "We recently hosted our daughter's wedding in the garden at the Saint-Sulpice. The staff was extremely efficient as we planned this out of town event: the event coordinator was especially enthusiastic and detailed. We were not disappointed: the rooms are spacious and comfortable and have great provisions for a family: we especially liked the espresso machine on our bar. Continental buffet breakfast is included in the cost of the room: fresh fruit and excellent croissant. The dining room was ours for the event, and the meal was of the highest calibre. the location is smack in the middle of Old Montreal - take advantage of the valet parking. Our entire party had only positive things to say about this location.",
            "I spent just two nights here on a road trip which started in New York. Large room and living area, very clean, well laid out, comfy bed, good location, friendly staff. Whatever the wifi problem was that other reviewers mentioned, the hotel have come good on resolving as it worked fine from everywhere anywhere near the hotel. Overall I was really happy with my choice of hotel in Montreal. Nothing not to like here.",
            "For an 18th birthday/graduation present I decided to take my sister to Montreal for a long weekend. After hours of research I decided to go with this hotel due to the outstanding reviews that it got. I've stayed in many hotels all over the world and I've never been as disapointed with a hotel. The service was HORRIBLE. Right after the valet parked my car I realized that I forgot some things in it. When I approached one of the valets about it he rolled his eyes and sighed. Not called for! The next morning I couldn't find the tickets for my breakfast, which was included.. When I explained it to the girl that was working she was extremely rude and talked down to me about the situation. I also have severe allergies, which I communicated to the hotel before I got there and when we checked in. There was one really nice girl at the front desk, I wish I could remember what her name was.. Long story short.. My needs were ignored and I got blamed for the situation. Most of the staff weren't very understanding or very friendly. It is in a great location though.",
            "We stayed for two nights and loved our room! The hotel was sophisticated, and luxurious. My partner and I are a younger couple and we were treated with the highest level of respect. The front desk staff recommended a wonderful restaurant within walking distance, and were helpful in answering all of our questions. We would definitelyu stay here again. The close location to subway services made moving around the city in the nasty cold Quebec winter tolerable! Next time we will visit in the summer so we can enjoy more of this beautiful city.",
            "My wife and I had 2 stays here over a 2 week period on a trip that began and ended in Montreal. The staff and the location are fantastic. The rooms are beautifully appointed albeit with some questionable furniture pieces. Staying in 2 different rooms gave us a better perspective of things as they have used the same funiture to address different room configurations. We actually had 2 tvs in the second room - #614 which I highly recommend. Facing the inner courtyard is a good idea as it is very quiet in spite of the ambient noise of the air conditioning exhaust. Facing St Paul St can be a very noisy experience. The balconies are small but serviceable. A really nice touch is the L'Ocitanne toiletries that are provided as well as the complementry bottled water that is delivered every evening. The Chateau Frontenac in Quebec was charging $8 for a bottle in the room. Some other reviews have been critical of the continental breakfast but we found it quite good and it is complementry. There is a breakfast menu for those wanting a full breakfast. The concierges were really helpful, courteous and well informed, as were the rest of the front desk staff. The valet staff were also first class and the car came quickly when requested. The bang for the buck in this hotel is outstanding, I have already booked it for a business trip in August.",
            "We recently spent two nights at the Saint Sulpice. The hotel is located in Old Montreal so we could walk everywhere. We had a three room suite (BR, LR/Kitchenette and Bath) that was like having our own apartment. There is a real neighborhood feel to the area and we were right around the corner from the Notre Dame Basilica. There are many restaurants in the area, plus we found a grocery store and a pharmacy within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. The staff was courteous and helpful and the service excellent. We plan to return to Montreal and will stay in the Saint-Sulpice.",
            "I recently returned from Montreal after honeymooning for about a week at Le Saint Sulpice. The hotel was magnificent! My husband called in advance of our trip to request an early check-in, and we were able to get into our room upon arrival. We had a deluxe suite on the 4th floor that faced the courtyard. The bathroom was very nice with a large bathtub and huge shower. The bedroom was small, but very cozy and romantic. The bed was amazingly comfortable. We also had a fireplace and a lovely balcony. I highly recommend a balcony. I spent a lot of time sipping my morning coffee and evening wine while watching the activity in the courtyard. On another note, continental breakfast was included with our rate and available in the restaurant until 11:00 AM. And, nightly turn-down service was provided. Le Saint Sulpice is perfectly located in the heart of Vieux Montreal. Highlights located nearby include the museum Pointe-\u00c3\u00a0-Calli\u00c3\u00a8re, the bar at the Hotel Place d'Armes, and the restaurant Le Club Chasse et Peche. Make sure to escape the tourists, though, and head to other areas of town. We had great bagels in Montreal's Mile-End neighborhood and smoked meat sandwiches at Schwartz's on St. Laurent. For a fabulous brewpub, go to Dieu du Ciel on Laurier Ave. For sushi, go to Jun I, also on Laurier. The English area of town around Crescent Street is also worth checking out. We bar hopped starting at the Winston Churchill Pub . For a clubby, Manhattan-ish experience, go to Cavalli on Peel. For you gamblers, spend an evening at the massive Casino de Montreal. We won!",
            "In the heart of old Montreal. Close to shopping, dining, sight seeing and the Metro. Makes for an idle base of operations. Rooms are clean, well appointed and functional. Contain all the amentities you need, included a small kitchen area. The staff was there to assist, and the conceirge efficiently took care of dinner reservations landing us a table at the difficult to visit Au Pied De Cochon. A wonderful stay, hope to return.",
            "just returned from a fabulous weekend in montreal with my hubby...the hotel was superb...the lotus flower fragrance upon entering the lobby was incredible...the location perfect...the linens sublime...the sound of the church bells from our open courtyard window heavenly...i want to go back!!! we'd stay here again that's for sure!",
            "Picked the hotel after finding a good on line deal and reading strong reviews from other travelers. I didnt see any issues with carpeting or age of the rooms as others had noted. I think we got a recently renovated room. Room was great, concierge (Ettien?) was excellent he reall understood what we were looking for in restaurants and shopping, and the location cant be beat. My only issue would be that we were on the first floor facing the street so our room was a bit noisy and we couldnt not open our curtains. Otherwise great boutique hotel..",
            "Overall, we couldn't have asked for more from Le Saint-Sulpice. The room was spacious, clean, and had all the modern amenities...stove, sink, separate living room and bedroom (each with a television), large tiled shower and sepate bath. We had two dogs with us and the staff provided great service. We were welcomed curbside by the friendliest of gents who was super with the pets and provided us with all the information that we needed. Having dogs is always tricky when traveling, but again, the staff was exceptionally accomodating. When we inquired about the best local restaurants, the staff was honest (and not pushing their own place) and guided us well. Right in the heart of old Montreal....close to the water and walking distance to everything. Courtyard-side was worth the small extra charge. The dog-friendly room was out of the way of the rest of the patrons which allowed us to take them in and out without bothering others, but quality of the room wasn't compromised because of the dog's presence. Loved the staff, loved the location, loved the room. Great place!",
            "We have just returned from a lovely stay at this Hotel. It is centrally located , walking distance to everything. Science Center , Imax theater, waterfront, parks, Shops, restaurants, and around the corner The Notre-Dame Basilica. The Basilica has a wonderful light -sound and history show at night this is a very nice way to see the church. Our 12 year old daughter loved it! The hotel has everything to offer, outdoor patio seating and another restaurant down stairs This is where they serve breakfast. Our room was huge, large living room with kitchenette, pull out couch. French door opening out to patio. plenty of closet space. Great bathroom ,shower and soaking tub glass sinks, robes and plenty of L'Occitane products. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. We needed to get our car out to go to the Boidome area and it took less than 10 mins. This Hotel has a small gym upstairs and a spa. I didn't have time to use either. The other thing that this Hotel has to offer being in old Montreal most buildings have steps. Saint-Sulpice is totally handicapped accessible. They offer accessible rooms with showers, there is a ramp in the lobby, no steps to get into Hotel, and an elevator. I would reccommend this Hotel to everyone, Because of the great location, accessibility, and friendly staff and service.",
            "One of the best experiences I've had with a hotel. The location is great, every staff person I encountered was friendly, and incredibly helpful. The room was bigger than we imagined, clean, and pretty luxurious (large deep tub, gas fireplace, Nespresso maker, two TVs, great bed, etc...) And on top of all this, they welcome dogs. No \"dog smell\" in the room, no attitude from staff or other customers, very accommodating in terms of cleaning the room when we were out with our dog. This will be where I always stay. Oh, and there's free breakfast.",
            "Loved this place!! Not sure if all rooms are suites, but ours was--two sets of windows opening onto lovely courtyard, complete with a wedding ceremony/reception to watch on our first evening with our fellow third floor residents. While not the full balcony we had hoped for, the windows opened enough so that it felt like it. One night we had a torrential downpour, and it was so romantic to open up the windows, lean on the rail, and watch the lightning and listen to the rain fall while staying dry... Water was delivered daily, the doormen and concierge were always attentive, every amenity was available, and the accupressure massage in the spa was, put simply, the best I've ever had. If they had an open appointment, we would have gotten a pedicure as well. You cannot beat the location--the waterfront two blocks away, all of the old city at your doorstep, the metro within 200 yards. (Only two suggestions: higher thread count sheets would be nice, and staff need to give more precise directions to restaurants. We missed a reservation because we hunted for the place we were sent without success, even with the map.) The price was right, and I have been raving about all the St. Sulpice since I got home. Thanks for a memorable 20th anniversary! !",
            "My Fiance and I stayed here to celebrate our engagement in December 2011. We greatly enjoyed our stay. Excellent location allowed us to leave our car with their valet and walk throughout much of the Old Port as well is only a 5-10 minute walk from the nearest metro station which allows quick access to the rest of the City. We stated in a Deluxe Suite which did not disappoint, a great balcony, wonderful fire place (which we used daily) a large bathroom and a small en suite kitchen which was wonderful for preparing snacks and drinks throughout our stay. The Staff were all lovely and very welcoming and the golden key concierege lived up to their reputation arranging anything and everything we requested. We had drinks in the Sinclair lounge several nights and really enjoyed the bartenders there, they encouraged us to try Sortil\u00c3\u00a8ge - a locally made whiskey infused with maple syrup - this did not disappoint and we left Montreal with several bottles to stock our bar at home. All in all our trip was a complete success thanks to the wonderful staff and beautiful hotel.",
            "We stayed at the Saint-Sulpice hotel two weeks ago and it was just amazing! Our room was really spacious, the furniture is stylish and the staff is very professional. The hotel is located in the old montreal and is next to almost all interesting spots. I definitely recommend this hotel and will come back for sure!",
            "My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in August. The hotel staff were always friendly and accomodating and answered all our questions. The room was wonderful -- tons of room, comfortable seating, nice view of the street. I wasn't too keen on the bed -- it was rather too firm for my taste, but I didn't really expect anything different. My only complaint would be about the maid service. While they do way more than I would expect (like washing the dishes we used from the kitchenette), it was a constant battle to keep our toilet paper and tissues replenished. We finally left a good tip for housekeeping and got some toilet paper. I almost think this is housekeepings way of getting back at the people staying in hotels (this seems to happen more often than not, and not just at this hotel). The rooms were clean, linens fresh, many extras available that normally aren't at other hotels, and the room service was superb!",
            "I stay at the Saint Sulpice 2/3 times per year when in Montreal for business meetings. After the renovation works of last year, it was clear to me that imporvements have continued at the hotel. Staff was extremely nice, as usual; excellent service; location is right in the heart of old Montreal. I personally didn't like too much the new d\u00c3\u00a9co of the restaurant and especially the acustic... We happened to be there a day while a big group of probably 50-60 people from a conference were having lunch and it was impossible to listen what we were saying. Also somewhat disappointing was the fact that the minibar was empty, with just a bottle of wine in it. I know this could be used for own grocery, but when travelling for business and after a long day I find quite nice to have a drink without needing to call the room service! Beside that, I was again quite satisfied and will certainly return.",
            "Stayed here for two nights this weekend. The location is superb - right in the heart of old Montreal. The staff are wonderful - they greet you by name once you've registered, the valet parking is quick and efficient, the registration staff lovely. The hotel lobby is tastefully decorated and comfortable. I had stayed here twice before years ago and loved the room. The room this time seemed to be missing something. The furniture was quite scratched and there was a blank wall with extension cords going to lamps - it looks like there should be a chair or table or something to furnish the wall. I don't think we had a queen sized bed but it was very comfy - with a big duvet. The bathroom is terrific - big, modern, clean. Having a little kitchen counter, glasses, bottle opener was great. We had a complementary breakfast in Sinclairs and had invited friends to join us. The continental breakfast buffet is very good - lovely little croissants and pains au chocolat, fruit, cereal. My husband ordered \u00c3\u00a0 la carte and said the eggs, sausage, beans, potatoes were not great.",
            "We stayed here the night after we got married. We were upgraded to a suite which was very nice. The hotel does have some quirks, but for a very old building in the heart of Montreal it is very nice. The rooms are clean, bright and comfortable. We had a coffee machine in our room which was nice and the breakfast was excellent. My only complaint is having to hand over your car keys when arriving to the door man. Overall an excellent hotel with lots of character.",
            "We were two adults and one 13 year old and we all thought the room was one of the best hotels we had EVER stayed at. we were there on a thursday so our rate was also excellent. Right in the heart of old Montreal, two blocks from Science center. Thanks St-sulpice!",
            "Le Saint-Sulpice is located in Old Montreal - a great location for walking to Chinatown, several museums, and the Quays of the Old Ports of Montreal. The hotel is small, and our room was perfect for our stay. We had a refrigerator, sink, dishes, and stove top. The hotel's stay includes a breakfast in the hotel's dining room. It includes breads, muffins, cereal, tons of fruit, great coffee, juice, and ambiance. If you want eggs, you will pay an additional $10. We stayed one week, and on the last night, a maid walked in our room with a huge bottle of water. We were leaving the next morning via plane, so we left the bottle. I'm not sure why we didn't get that water during our stay. One oddity was that we asked the front desk to call a taxi for us to leave at 5 AM for the airport. When we got downstairs, there was no taxi, so my husband walked to the end of the block and flagged one down. The main valet kept apologizing. Odd -",
            "First off all, I don't know why the other reviews talk down about the Murphy Bed. It was just a trendy furniture with a real mattress. I've stayed previously with my girlfriend in a Deluxe closed bedroom last time and I can assure you that it is the same mattress and firmness with a tad of heavenly soft on the top. Now to the good stuff. As it was our second stay, we knew very well where we were going. The hotel is super well located in the heart of Old Montreal behind the Notre-Dame Basilica which is holding an Exhibition on the artifacts of the Vatican's museum. You should go and have a look. WOW! The staff as usual was very pleasant and helpful. Some of them even recognized us from a year before. I took the time to remember some of the names of many good employees such as Michael, Rafal, Dave, Luis and the lovely Anthea. Although we had been here before, we made sure to look for the Chef Concierge Patrick who had given us great restaurant recommendations last time. He gave us the 411 on what was happening and the new restaurants we should try out and the new whereabouts for shopping. Wow! Once again he didn't fell us and sent us to great eating places (Club Chasse et Peche, Version Laurent Godbout, Europea and Boris Bistro). Last but not least, we had been referred by Julien to try out the lunch on the MAGNIFICENT terrasse in the back. They have this hidden garden located in the back of the hotel and the kitchen cooks BBQ grilled meat and vegetables outside in front of you. Food was delicious and the service way up there just like the hotel. I took time to remember two fantastic waiters, Bojan and Etiene I think. In sum, all I can say is that becoming the best is easy but staying the best is the hardest part and all of you at the St-Sulpice seemed to know what it takes to stay on TOP. Great job and keep it up!",
            "My mother and I stayed at this hotel and we thought it was fabulous. The way the rooms are set up - like small suites - was just wonderful for a vacation. It was as if we each had our own room, for the price of one. If one of us wanted to stay up late or get up early it wasn't a problem. One night we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. Frankly, we were just expecting mediocre \"hotel food.\" But we were delighted at the meal and agree that, for both of us, it was one of the best restaurant meals we had ever had. And for two foodies from Chicago, that's pretty good. The concierge was great. I left my sweater in a taxi and they scoured the city and found it. Wonderful!",
            "We stayed at the Le Saint Sulpice for a long weekend the week before Christmas. The hotel was one of the highlights of the trip! The room was quite spacious, well decorated and very clean. The large living room, bedroom and bathrooms were all separate giving it a \"home\" feel. We even had a kitchenette. The balcony view of the back of the Notre Dame cathedral was very nice. The location was fine as well, we were right in the heart of Old Montreal. The service was great: we were expecting a little snotiness because are Americans but there was none of that. The staff was courteous and very helpful. The best part of our stay there was coming home at night and lighting a fire in the fireplace- it was just what we needed after a long day out in the cold. We will definitely stay at the Le Saint Sulpice on our next rip to Montreal.",
            "My husband and daughter (age 14) spent two nights at the Hotel St. Sulpice in Montreal. The hotel is located in Old Montreal and very close to the Cathedral. We chose the hotel because it offered a suite with an enclosed bedroom so we could have privacy. We were delighted with the tastefully decorated room, comfortable bed & comfortable enough pullout sofa; with the quaint balcony, and extremely professional service at the front desk. We also received free breakfast for 2 each morning and that was delicious too. I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. Another plus, the hotel lobby had a subtle but nice fragrance - verbena, I think. Really nice. This hotel would be equally good for business travelers, families with older children and friends on a weekend shopping/cultural trip. You can walk to the shops and restaurants of Old Montreal. Did I miss anything? Go there!! The cathedral \"light show was kinda, okay very, hokey but still informative. Don't get me started on the bus tour....skip that.",
            "Company corporate rate caused me to stay there many times over the past 2 years. Have found it uneven in service and cleanliness. Often there is no one at the desk at night or they're understaffed. Room and laundry service are hit or miss. Even tried to make up for past troubles (lost my laundry for a day) by giving me a special edible treat, which turned out to be spoiled! Rooms are soulless, and have found the previous guests garbage or crusty washcloth still in the room upon arrival on more than one occasion. There are many better places in Montreal.",
            "Just returned from a wonderful 5 day trip to the city of Montreal and a very satisfying stay at the Hotel Le Saint Sulpice in the Vieux Montreal section of the city. We arrived late on a Thursday and were given an upgrade to an exec. suite which was roomy and comfortable w/ a fireplace and a spacious deck. All the rooms are suites of varying size so I wouldn't want to mislead anyone but as I said this room was ideal. My wife enjoyed a 1 1/2 hr massage in their spa which is not luxe but nonetheless clean and comfortable. There's that word again. All told the hotel is very well located, the staff extremely friendly and helpful, and we would return to the Saint Sulpice in an instant.",
            "This is a great apartment hotel in Old Montreal. The room was spacious and comfortable with a really luxurious bathroom. Tthe public areas were very stylish, except for the restaurant which was a bit dark and severe for breakfast. However, the thing that sets this hotel apart is the staff - they seem to genuinely enjoy working there, which made it a pleasure to stay there. When the wireless connection in our room didn't work, four people arrived, one after the other, to sort the problem out till it was fixed. The location is great for sightseeing, although many of the restaurants nearby are touristy and mediocre. Montreal `grew' on us as a city and if we returned we would be delighted to stay at St Sulpice again.",
            "My husband and I were looking for a weekend get a way and the Saint-Sulpice was a perfect destination. We stayed for two nights and took advantage of their package which included two passes to the Scandinavian Spa. The spa was only a block away and heavenly. Although we had a rainy weekend, our deluxe suite was very comfortable and inviting with a fireplace and balcony over looking Old Montreal. All of the staff we encountered were very helpful but I cannot say enough about the Concierge. His recommendations were exactly what we were looking for in terms of restaurants, walking routes and entertainment. We were also very impressed with the selection and scope of the continental breakfast. Don't forget to try the croissants! We would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Montreal. Enjoy!",
            "This was my second trip to Montreal, and my second stay at St Sulpice. I absolutely love this hotel. The service is top notch staff is friendly and helpful. I paid the additional nightly fee for a suite to avoid the Murphy bed. To me, it's worth the $20 or so extra per night to have so much additional space and a comfortable bed. We had another lovely suite- this time with a fireplace. The bathroom was larger than our suite from last year- we had a double sink and did not have the frosted glass btwn the bath & bedroom. Only disappointment in this layout was that the bedroom did not have a dressing table. However, we did have a larger living room. I love that they remember little details- like the personalized business cards upon check in, the nightly bottled water, and the card showing the weather forecast for the next day. I've read reviews here before about the free breakfast- once again I didn't try the breakfast. There is a fabulous pastry shop about four doors down on Notre Dame called Claude Postel. Drag yourself out of bed and spend the money you would have spent tipping the waitstaff for the free hotel breakfast at Claude Postel. It's worth it! Even in the bitter cold!! As long as CP is open, I don't think I will ever eat the hotel breakfast. We ate dinner on our last night at the S Restaurant in the hotel. The food was tasty, but not very adventurous, and was more expensive than some of the delicious meals we had during the weekend. It was what I expeceted food to be at a hotel of this calibur. Spa staff was great, front desk staff was very helpful, valet was prompt with our car, room was clean and neat. Another wonderful stay at this hotel- can't wait to return!",
            "Took the TripAdvisor recommendations on board and booked a stay at this hotel using Expedia. Got a great rate which made the stay even better. Friendly front desk staff and concierges. The room was really good, a big bath suitable for two and a separate stand up shower. Nice comfy bed and separate living room with TV - windows overlooked yard. The bonus was having a very well equipped kitchenette too. Great for making sandwiches and snacks for our trips out of the city. The fridge had plenty of room for our food too. Plenty of cutlery, plates, bowls and a microwave. The rooms in this hotel were as good as any European hotel I have stayed in. Now what could be better? The lighting in the living area was a bit too subdued and akward to control centrally. The glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom could distrub someone sleeping if someone else used the bathroom at night. The restaurant and breakfasts were really good with excellent service. However, some tables close to the restaurant entrance seemed to have lots of flies when we were there on several hot August days - not a serious problem but the staff could do with managing it. We went out to the rear garden restaurant one evening for a drink and it too was very dark and service was a bit slow. Car parking is extra but you are in the middle of Old or Vieux Montreal. Cab s arrived promptly on request and the local Metro station is 5-6 mins walk away giving easy access to other parts of the city. Highly recommended and I will have no hesitation in staying there on future visits to Montreal - way better than one of those 80s / 90s chain hotels that claim to be 4 or 5 star.",
            "I stayed here over the Christmas and Boxing Day holidays. The hotel is in an outstanding location, directly behind Notre Dame and steps away from the shops and restaurants of Rue St. Paul. The room was fairly large, and included a small kitchenette. The bathroom was spacious, and had a separate (large) tub and walk-in shower. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff were polite and helpful. There isn't a gym inside the hotel; but they have access to a very small facility about one block away. There is free wifi in the hotel, but it was pretty slow.",
            "A great hotel! As previous reviews mentioned; excellent service was housed here and all the staff that we interacted with were polite, smiling and helpful. The room was a deluxe suite (#216). Very nice size, bedroom was great and the bathroom was extremely comfy. The room also had a kitchenette, with pots, and dishes provided if you really want to cook. Two tv's in the room; one in the bedroom and one in the sitting area. The negatives were bad food via room service (just luke warm and bland) and albeit still a nice bathroom the tiles were starting to get warn. All that aside and you have still have a great hotel in Old Montreal. Approx. 5 min walk to the Metro (Notre Dame station), liquor store near by (1min away), and lots of great restuarants. Don't go to Eggspectations across from the Cathedral...its average food and packed with tourists. Try a little cafe or restaurant within Old Montreal. Ask the concierge. Enjoy.",
            "My husband and I had to travel to Montreal on business and within minutes of our arrival, took the smiling suggestion of the reservations desk and extended our stay to two nights. The hotel is lovely - shares one (or more) of it's walls with Notre Dame cathedral, yet is very contemporary, solid (read as \"thick\" walls so we found it very quiet!) and immaculate. We selected Saint Sulpice based on location, ability to bring our small dog, and cost - and it didn't fail our expectations on any front. It was convenient to include our dachsund in our plans (very much worth the extra $50 deposit to have her with us rather than kennel her) and the exceptional staff had all three of us feeling more than welcome. Kudos to the concierge/front desk recommendations - we were steered right with every request for the where-to-eats and what-to-sees! I strongly agree with the former reviewer's commendation about the valets. They parked our oversized van right next to the hotel - safely and without complaint - quick to call our room when they were uncertain as to how to lock the side cabinets for us. I loved our spacious room and small deck. Just behind the hotel is a perfect grassy spot to walk the dog (bring baggies! The lawn and little garden is well-kept). We found the down-filled bedding very comfortable, so our mattress was clearly not the same as the former reviewer's. Our only complaint became a little joke between my husband and I - that the towels are far from soft. We laughingly called our drying off \"The Exfoliation\"! This hotel far exceeded our expectations - especially when it came to service. We'd return - wouldn't stay elsewhere in Montreal - if it weren't for the seven hour drive.",
            "We've stayed at Le Saint-Sulpice several times and have always enjoyed our stay. The hotel is located in the heart of Old Montreal just behind the Notre Dame Cathedral. The lobby of the hotel is warmly decorated and includes a cozy sitting area around a large fireplace. Through the lobby is a beautiful courtyard restaurant under white canopy. We've eaten at the restaurant a few times and have found the food and service somewhat hit and miss. Overall acceptable though. The rooms are beautifully decorated with dark wood accents and modern decor. Some have electric fireplaces and some have small balconies. The rooms tend to be somewhat narrow but still provide a comfortable stay.",
            "We were extremely happy with the Hotel until we went for breakfast on Sunday Morning. My wife and I had the buffet The buffet was much to expensive for what was offered. The bananas were over ripe and the fruit was hard. We were very disappointed that we ate there. It spoiled our weekend.",
            "My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Le Saint--Sulpice very much. It 's in an ideal location just behind the Notre-Dame Basilica and just a five minute walk to the nearest Metro station (Place-d'Armes) or bus stop. We enjoyed that the rooms have a little kitchenette as the first day we went to the Jean Talon Market to buy salami, baguette, cheese, fresh fruits, and wine. The room came equipped with everything we needed to have an enjoyable dinner in front of the fireplace (dishes, utensils, wine glasses, etc--they even have microwave, refrigerator, and two burner stove). The included continental breakfast was great as well and we had good service each morning. Otherwise, we didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but we did have some enjoyable meals just a few minutes walk from the hotel (Resident, Olive and Gourmando, Europea Espace). When we first arrived, our toilet made a loud leaking noise every five minutes, so we called down and a service man was in our room within a few minutes. He was very friendly and helpful and did his best to fix it. After he left, it started leaking maybe every 10 minutes, but we weren't going to complain about it. When we got back to our room from dinner that night we realized that it was no longer leaking. We assume that the service man came back to our room to fix it when we weren't there because it was fine for the remainder of our stay. If management is reading this--we are very appreciative of his help! The only reason I'm not giving St. Sulpice the full five stars is, while still nice, the rooms could stand for new carpet and paint and possibly new televisions. Also, the first towel I picked up had some long strands of hair stuck to it, which made me hesitant about the cleanliness of the hotel, but that was my only negative experience.",
            "Our son and daughter-in-law arranged a 50th wedding anniversary celebration at the hotel. The staff was uniformly helpful and gracious. There were 18 of us (including children) and when we checked in the concierge welcomed us personally and wished us happy anniversary. We were extraordinarily fortunate and the weather was warm and sunny the whole weekend. We were able to have our before dinner drinks and canapes on the terrace. The celebration dinner at the hotel was excellent. Each evening bottled water was placed next to the beds - something one never gets even at the most upscale hotels in Europe. I have a theory that there is a correlation between the quality of hotels and towels: the towels were wonderful. The continental breakfast was fine although it would have been nice to have had rolls as a choice. Some of our party ordered cooked breakfasts which looked quite nice. One afternoon some of us had lunch on the terrace. Although service was slow, the food was good. Our one caveat: there is deferred maintenance and the carpets in the room should be replaced as should some of the couches, especially in our daughter's room. Our room, though, was perfect as we had been upgraded. The location in the heart of Old Montreal, near restaurants and the waterfront, was superb. If we ever returned to Montreal there is no question we would stay at this hotel.",
            "We recently returned from Montreal and wanted to share a wonderful experience at Le Saint Sulpice....comfortable and clean, elegant and attentive to detail. The one bedroom suite was ample and beds comfortable, even the Murphy bed. The staff was responsive and eager to help make our stay memorable. Concierge was excellent. Highly recommend this hotel and will certainly return.",
            "I chose the word Golden because for me it means something that last forever or memorable. Sometimes it hard to imagine that you can find in a small hotel the same quality of service that you expect in one big five-star hotel. Le Saint Sulpice is a small place but well located in the beautiful old part of Montreal. At the courtyard I think they have one of the coziest garden that I've seen in the area. Pleasant place to welcome friends or a special person. And regarding the service, what could I say as they have two Clefs d'Or Concierges there just for you! No doubt that those two Golden Keys holders helped me enjoy the most of the city and then leave there with that memorable experience!",
            "This is a fantastic hotel. Admittedly we had the most expensive suite (but it's an all-suite hotel so each one should be spacious) but the place was fantastic, everyone was helpful and friendly (NOT a given in Montreal believe me) and they even rang to say we'd left something in the room and did we want them to post it back.",
            "Great location in the midst of Old Montreal. The highlights of the hotel were: nicely appointed clean room, quiet location, short distance to Metro stop, better than average gym and access to many good restaurants within a few blocks of hotel. Disappointed to find out that if you book with Expedia your room will not include breakfast which apparently is included for most other types of reservations. In this situation consider saving a bundle of money by eating breakfast in one of several cafes just around the corner. Also, conceige was helpful with directions but restaurant recommmendations were no better than our random selections.",
            "A super \"boutique\" hotel in the old part of Montreal.. Very good service. Good size bathrooms. Free high speed Internet.. Superb restaurant in the hotel courtyard.. Before leaving Montreal and out of curiosity, I went to vist 4 other boutique hotels as well in old part of Montreal, and the Saint Suplice hotel is the best !! Definitively I will stay again at the Saint Sukpice, during my next trips to Montreal. Many excellent restaurants nearby. For indian food lovers, try the excellent GANDHi restaurant nearby.",
            "Very beautiful hotel with huge and comfortable rooms (my room was composed by: bath, bedroom, little kitchen, hall with fireplace). The breakfast is served in a nice covered garden. I was here for a business trip and the convention center of the hotel was convenient. The hotel is situated in a strategic position in the old Montreal and near the city centre.",
            "We had the pleasure of travelling to Montreal for the weekend and stayed at Le Saint-Sulpice. We had researched different hotels to stay at and chose this one based on the location and reputation it presented. We were amazed at the beauty of the hotel with the gardens and fresh scent as we walked in to the hotel. We were greated with a smile and were treated like royalty throughout the weekend. Our rooms were adjoined, as we were seven women travelling together for a girl's weekend pleasure trip. The rooms were large, beautiful and perfect for our needs. We really cannot say enough about this hotel. I plan to return in the fall with my husband for a romantic weekend. Thank you!",
            "This hotel is beautiful, luxurious, and in an excellent location! Staff was amazingly helpful and friendly. The location was perfect -- directly behind Notre Dame and walking distance from nearly anything! The room was spacious, we loved the bathroom and fireplace. The hotel only has queen beds, which were cozy. Only negative was the continental breakfast , which was just so-so and the upgrade to hot for $9 was ridiculous.",
            "As a free quant traveller I would say this hotel is high up my list of great stays. This is a great hotel for business or vacation stay. The rooms are big and clean and the hotel is very well located, everything is within a short ride or walking distance.",
            "this was our first trip alone since the birth of our daughter 3 years ago so we wanted it to be restful, luxurious and elegant. It was all three, definitely. Our room --- a Deluxe Suite -- was on the 6th floor and had both a fireplace and a balcony. The room, while slightly in decor, felt like our own personal pied-a-terre in old Mtl - we loved coming back for a late afternoon nap, cocktail hour on the patio and time to get ready for dinner in the well-appointed bathroom. The espresso machine was a great touch and continental breakfast on the Terrace was all we could have asked for to set off each great day. The neighbourhood is under construction, but there are still lots of opportunities for lovely moonlit walks down cobblestone streets. The hotel recommends some great restaurants on its website (see: \"for foodies\") and we tried two of them (thanks to reservations by the Concierge) and were totally amazed at the quality of the food. All in all, the Saint Sulpice feels very old school, quiet, and lovely - not for the party crowd or those who want the most modern feel - but wonderful for those who want to just enjoy a true Montreal vibe in a great area.",
            "Le Saint Sulpice was a delightful stay in the heart of Old Montreal. Granted, Montreal has some funky neighborhoods and unusual B&Bs, but we could stay in Vieux Montreal and easily walk to those neighborhoods--or take the metro from the Place D'Armes station. The staff at Saint Sulpice was very helpful when we needed any help, which was just once on arrival to adjust the air conditioning. Breakfast was included in the room price, also good because eating out every meal in Old Montreal can add up quickly. It is tres chic and the prices are too. The decor was well done. The bathroom was exceptional with large walk-in shower. All in all, very good value for the area.",
            "We were knocked out by this hotel, where we stayed for five nights in April. (five females) The staff were lovely, the rooms top class, and the location (none of us had a car) is ideal for the shops, restaurants and sightseeing. It was a superb holiday and we have decided to go back once the weather gets a bit warmer.",
            "We were allocated a Loft Suite and at first thought the many negative comments on this site about their Murphy beds were over the top as we normally like a firm bed. We are not from North America and had not seen one of these before - they can be folded back up into their frame on the wall to create space. This seemed strange since the suite had loads of space. With a 3 night stay, the bed did seem firm but OK on night 1. Night 2 involved a lot of tossing and turning with the lower sheet not staying in place as it was not big enough to reach under the mattress. Night 3 was the same, also affected by a lot of outside noise until the small hours (a Thursday evening) and I woke up to backache which did not clear throughout the following day. Otherwise, large well equipped room, free wifi and great location. The bed had a decent quilt and pillows, and the bathroom had a separate bathtub and shower. The shower was a bit feeble and (most strangely), the toilet roll was fitted on the wall opposite the toilet and out of reach. Good continental breakfast with juice, meats, various breads and croissants etc, and some delicious pots of panna cotta.",
            "I've recently stayed at the St-Sulpice as I wanted a special place to do my wedding proposal. One day before my arrival,I called the concierge (Patrick) who ended up working miracles for me. I told him: do whatever it takes to make it nice, fuzzy, warm and romantic. He had the flowers, the rose petals, the music, the candles, the fireplace, the violonist, the champagne, the strawberries, etc. His ideas were unlimited. Of course my girlfriend said: YES!!! Nonetheless, the room was charming, the rest of the staff was way up to par more so than many hotels I've traveled in. This staff takes their job to heart and it shows. Great bellmen and frontdesk clerks. Very few names I remembered cause they were all great. (Dave, Rafel, Mike, Julian, Mary-Helen). Wow! St-Sulpice, you know what it takes to be on the top, BRAVO! I will definitely come back in remembrance of this day. Thank you all for your great work!",
            "I took my husband for a weekend away to celebrate his 40th birthday and I wanted to make it a special weekend for him. The hotel was the perfect beginning to a wonderful weekend. Right from the front door we were greeted by smiling faces and helpful employees who made every effort to meet our needs. The staff were always very prompt with any requests (such as running right up to deliver an internet cable for our laptop when we had difficulty with the wireless connection) to calling for taxis for us when needed. The room was beautiful and even had a wood burning fireplace (we did not make use of this, but it was a really nice touch). The location of the hotel was ideal for exploring the old section of Montreal. We had dinner in the restaurant Le S on Friday night. The food was incredible!! Service from Simon was impecable and there was even a lovely jazz trio to entertain us. Overall we loved our stay at Le Saint Sulpice and look forward to staying there again.",
            "My husband and I love boutique hotels and by far, the Saint Sulpice is our favorite getaway. It's located in old Montreal by the Cathedral and surrounded by great shops and by loads of entertainment. The food and staff are always spectacular, and the location is superb. I understand that there are options to purchase a suite. It is well worth it since there are many festivals that occur in Montreal such as film festivals, and the famous jazz festival. During the Christmas Holidays, they do a superb job of decorating as well. Overall, it is an ezqusite boutique hotel and charming in every way!",
            "We were told that the room has just been renovated. It was large with a queen bed, a sofa and arm chair beside, an electric fireplace, a desk, and a kitchenette. The coffee maker makes really good espresso and factor in I have a fansy espresso machine at home! The bathroom has a large bath AND a large shower! You still find a lot of room for two people in there. Beside the restaurent that is average, it is the best place I have been in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al.",
            "I can't believe this lovely boutique hotel in Montreal is not in the top 10 list of recommended accommodations. We had a beautifully appointed suite with living room (including a sofa bed for our daughter), separate bedroom and full kitchenette for the price or a regular hotel room anywhere else. The setup is perfect for families, but the quaint, nicely furnished and quiet room would also make this a great choice for a romantic getaway. And the location couldn't be better -- right in the heart of Old Montreal.",
            "I stayed here with my mom and sister and we had a great experience (amazing location, great staff, clean rooms, etc.) EXCEPT for when we had a drink one night in the garden. We ordered a cheese plate and two glasses of champagne (didn't specify which) and the bill was $75 for the champagne. We almost choked it back up and told the waiter who returned with the \"fixed\" bill, which was $50 for the champagne. This really left us with a bad taste in our mouths in an otherwise wonderful 3-night stay with no other issues. We felt rather cheated - if it was indeed that much, at least let us know if the price when ordering.",
            "First off, I want to say that the hotel is a nice property, with great staff, in a beautiful area. But, I think it really depends what you are looking for, and what your preference is. For my wife and I, we didn't realize until staying at st. sulpice that we prefer a cozy (but good size) hotel room over a suite hotel room with kitchenette, and living area space. I think these rooms are ideal for people who have a family, or have friends over to enjoy a drink before a night on the town. If thats the case, st. sulpice can't be beat. As for the location, it's ideal for old montreal, but it's still a 20 minute walk or so up to saint catherine. There are many other hotels which are located more in the middle (10 minutes to old montreal, 10 minutes to downtown). But again, if staying in Old Montreal is your thing, the location can't be beat. Another thing which I noticed on tripadvisor were the comments about the murphy bed. I agree, there is simply no need for it, and it's not all that comfortable. The room is big enough, I won't need to put the bed back into the wall to save space? Also, the shower 'wall' which you can see the shadows from the living room just doesn't make alot of sense. I'm into chic and trendy things, but I found this unnecessary. So, I don't want to be too hard on st. sulpice (I did give it 4) because although it's not exactly what my wife and I were looking for, it could be ideal for others.",
            "(We actually stayed here in August of 2010, not September). The rooms here are elegant and comfortable. The staff is helpful and respectful, especially with the valet parking. The restaurant has excellent food and service. Breakfast is good. We loved it here.",
            "We recently stayed at the St-Sulpice for a weekend and was treated terribly. It first began with the valet being rude as he thought maybe because I was driving an inexpensive 1998 Toyota Camry, I should not park in front of the hotel. He was extremely rude while informing me and my wife that it was for GUests Only!! He was shocked to learn we were guests. Check in was a disaster, as they could not find our rsvp( Good thing my wife printed the confirmation letter) After seeing our room, we felt better but it was dirty still!!! The bellman apologized and we returned to the lobby until it could be fixed. One Hour later!!! For the price we paid, they did not even compensate us with anything! Breakfast the next morning was good but the staff didnot have any information on bus tours and seemed clueless? Overall. it was not a memorable experience, and I unfortunately cannot reccommend this hotel. It is it worth 400$? Never!"

The location is fantastic, the value and the reasonable quality makes it hard to beat. The hotel felt a bit more worn than the first time we stayed here, seems that not too much money is spent on refurbishment. I doubt that we'll be back for a third time. Nevertheless, I you want to stay in center of Barcelona without paying megabucks, we can recommend this hotel.",

Staff were friendly enough nice,modern,clean, and spacious room the only falt was that the rooms were very dark ther were only spotlights that were extremely dull but overall we enjoyed our stay and would definetly recommend this hotel as the location is great :) x",
            "The hotel is centrally located at the foot of Las Ramblas. If you want to be in the heart of the city, this is the place. The rooms are clean, well appointed and modern. The service was above average to good. The staff made an effort to accomodate me with my issues and did their best. I found a great rate on the internet and I strongly believe that I received the best bang for my buck for Barcelona. Note to light sleepers! The walls are pretty thin and you can hear even the slightest activity outside your door. But, this is understandable given the age of the building.",
            "The Hotel Regina is in a fantastic location, just off La Rambla and the Placa del Catalonya. It is next door to the Pulitzer Hotel and has the same manager. I was there for 5 days in April 2008. I had requested a room on a higher floor, away from the elevators and maid storage room, with a balcony. I received exactly what I had requested. The hotel provides all guests with a complimentary bottle of cava and a box of dessert chocolates - a very nice touch. The staff was very helpful and attentative. Maid service was terrific. The bar area serves some food or you can go to the dining room at the Pulitzer Hotel. There is room service - breakfast through late evening. The hotel room itself was great - nice size for a European hotel, extremely comfortable bed, in room safe and television, nice bathroom with amenities. It made for a very pleasant experience and stay in Barcelona",
            "We couldn't believe how close to the very centre this hotel was- on a side street just off Placa Catalunya- less than a 2 min walk from the square that's on the top of La Ramblas. Yet the hotel is far enough away not to be noisy at night, and the street is very quiet at night. The room we stayed in was small- but I've stayed in smaller rooms in higher star hotels in London, and so I expected it in such a central hotel. Esp as we booked through a discount website and not directly. The bed did take up most of the bedroom space and the window looked out over a dark alleyway so not much natural light. However the room looked to be recently refurbished and was very comfortable and I didn't feel at all claustrophobic despite the room size. The bathroom was gorgeous, and the shower was wonderful- very powerful. The toiletries they provide are lovely and they also provide robes and slippers. There's also free internet all over the hotel, which is great if you've a laptop or iphone. The bar is really nice- big comfortable sofas and a big cocktail menu. The staff in the hotel are all very friendly and helpful. They also have discount rates for the bus tours and are quite happy to book restaurants and answer any questions. I really couldn't fault this hotel at all and if we return to Barcelona it would definitely be our first choice.",
            "We stayed here one night pre cruise on June 13, 2009. The hotel has a great location near the top of Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. Our room wasn't ready as we arrived in the morning, but they will gladly stored our luggage for us. We had a family room which was a large room with four comfortable beds (two of the beds were pushed together to form a queen size bed) so all four of us could stay in one room. The bathroom was good sized and had wonderful amenities (shampoo, lotions, and individual toiletry kits for gentleman and ladies). There are also three computers with internet access available for free us which was convenient. The only problem with the room is that the air conditioning did not work very well and the room was hot (it was 78 degrees F in the room most of the time). Fortunately, we were so tired that we slept fine anyways. The staff was fairly friendly and called a taxi for us when we departed the next day for the pier.",
            "I stayed at the Hotel Regina last week, having selected the hotel after a great deal of research. Besides wanting a nice facility with decent-sized rooms, I was very concerned about being able to avoid smoke. I sought a guarantee about all public space being smoke-free, as well as my room. To my delight, this was the case. No smoking allowed in the lobby, the restaurant, the Internet area, which is exactly what I wanted. And the room had no lingering odor, and was quite clean and comfortable. The beds could have been more comfortable, however. Very standard mattresses. Also, I would have liked a clock in the room - bring your own. The location is excellent, and close to a major Metro stop. It's always just a very short walk from the bustling Ramlas and Boqueria Market, a real bonus. Another positive is the assistance I received from a young man named Derek, who helped me out with a tricky dilemma, by making calls in Spanish for me, and being very accommodating. The area towards the back of the lobby was just right for use of the Internet, and because there are three computers, I always found one available, a real necessity when traveling. I can highly recommend this hotel.",
            "Stayed a few nights in this hotel in November, 2011. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant. The hotel is nice and the rooms are nice, standard sized European rooms, with hardwood floors. The breakfast that comes with the hotel package is a standard European breakfast - both scrambled and boiled eggs, cold cereals and oatmeal, several types of ham, sausages, and bacon; pastries, several types of breads/rolls, butter, jam, fruits, orange juice, milk, and mineral water, all buffet style. There is free Wi-Fi access. The hotel is situated around the corner from Las Ramblas, which is great if you like the activity of Las Ramblas without having to hear it in your hotel room. The hotel is directly across the street from the entrance of the Metro station, but with the room I stayed in, I had no problems, couldn't hear the train at all, just peace and quiet. Had a walk-out balcony, which was nice to view the surrounding area. In my opinion, it's best to take a Taxi to the hotel. There are buses and the metro nearby, but depending on the time of night and how much luggage you have, it's probably better to take a taxi if you're not familiar with the area. Of course there's tons of stores and eateries in the Las Ramblas area. I suggest getting the hop-on/hop-off tour bus pass from the hotel, it's a few Euros cheaper and well worth it. Start out early though, as it takes you to other nice areas to shop and eat and lots of beautiful sights to see. I've been to Barcelona previously, so I definitely felt comfortable in the area. Even if I hadn't visited previously, would definitely still feel comfortable being out and about alone. Hard Rock Cafe is a five minute walk away as well, if you're interested. Staff was great there too!! Would definitely recommend this hotel again and again.",
            "From Goh S.B. and Family... We have 4 nights of wonderful stay in Regina Hotel Barcelona just last week. The Family Room is huge - 4 single beds with large space to move around. It is very clean - it seems that the housekeeper would come in to clean and tidy up the room each time we are out. The receptionists are friendly and have no problem conversing in English. Breakfast is good, with wide range of meat, cereals, fruits and juices. A bit expensive though. I am particularly glad that the management readily modified the room rate each time it is reduced from time of my booking. One thing we find missing in the room - the complimentary coffee and tea, or at least an electric kettle. Though Starbuck is just next door, it is always great to return to the room and make for ourselves a cup of real hot drink to complete the day, especially during winter. Location is fantastic. Very convenient - direct transport by Aeroport Bus from the airport. This Hotel will definitely be our first choice if we decide to re-visit Barcelona.",
            "I stayed here as single female traveller for 4 nights in a single room. Room - is clean and comfortable. This is the only hotel in all the Spain hotels i've been in that actually supplied full set of toiletries in particular toothbrush, sanitary bags, shower cap and slippers. The toilet could use better cleaning cuz it smelled a bit bad. The room is otherwise comfortable and well maintained. I also agree with other reviews that the banging doors could be a bit annoying. I also stayed at their sister hotel Pulitzer Hotel, in comparison Regina's decor is not as stylish, and service is not as comprehensive but the facilities are almost just as good. Service - is good. A few faults I could pick: The room service plates were not collected until housekeeping cleans your room the next day. The other thing was I posted 2 postcards via the reception and these are the only 2 cards that didn't reach the recipient. Not sure the reception or the postal service was to blame. Location - is excellent. Feels very safe to walk back to at night. Just 2 minutes away from the middle of town Plaza de Catalunya, where the tourist buses depart from and where the tourist information center is located. Very close to the Rambla and the surrounding shopping area. Walking distance to Barri Gotic and even to attractions that are further north such as Casa Batllo if you care to walk a bit further.",
            "We stayed at this hotel 9 - 11 May 2009. The rooms were clean, modern and very comfortable. The only downside being there is no storage space for clothes! The hotel is right in the centre of everything and with a Starbucks next door which we made full use of during our stay. I would definately recommend this hotel to all types of traveller.",
            "stayed one night after finding the jazz hotel fully booked, check in was ok. location is pretty good. Once in room were disappointed to find that the room looked like it needed a paint, scuff marks on the walls etc. The ac vent was filthy, lucky we could open the balcony doors we were a bit frightened to use the ac ! Beats me why the management can't just book a room out for a day and paint the walls ! also the hall way carpet stained in places. The room was quiet though and the bed , linen was good. Its probably ok value but the jazz is better. Our room rate included breakfast (32e) but we were leaving before 7 so couldn't have the breakfast. I was a bit p*ssed off when the guy at the desk would not refund the 32E. Would not stay there again",
            "My wife and I spent five nights at the Regina. It is a lovely hotel situated in a nice street just off Placa de Catalunya and near Las Ramblas. Perfect location. Our room, situated on the fifth floor facing the street, was quiet, very clean with a good range of toiletries and linen was regularily replaced. Provision of robes and slipppers in the room and free access to the internet near reception was a bonus. Only small gripe about the room was the space at foot of bed which was too narrow to allow our larger case to be pulled through. However general layout and space in room and bathroom was excellent. Reception staff were very efficient, helpful and friendly. A couple who were with us had problems with a leaking shower but the response to their complaint was immediate. Attempted repair was ineffective but they were offered a change of room - excellent response and service. Overall this is a great hotel but let down by the breakfast. We found the hot dishes and the \"hot\" water for tea to be lukewarm and one morning we waited 25 minutes for the bacon to be replenished despite being advised, a few times \"it will only be a minute\". However the range of food on offer was fairly good. We used the hop on hop off bus for two days and found it very useful. The Bus Touristic is the most popular and there were long queues at a few stops. The other company, red buses, did not appear to have queues but check which sites they visit. The discount booklet provided helped save a few euros on entrance fees. You can also save couple of euros by purchasing your bus pack from reception. Expect to queue at some of the more popular attractions e.g. to get on the lift in the Sagrada Familia we would have had to queue for about one and a half hours.",
            "Our family of 4 stayed here 1 night post cruise and chose the hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and I can see why the hotel gets such a high rating. It couldn't be in a better location, only a 100 yds off Catalunya in a quiet side street. It's a stylish hotel with a very welcoming staff and nice public areas. Our quad room was large and well equipped with nice touches such as bathrobes and slippers and a complimentary plate of fruit and water provided in the evening. The bathroom was big, with plenty of fluffy towels and the bedroom had a large TV with a good selection of channels. The free internet (and WiFi) was a welcome addition - particularly since our stay coincided with 2 VERY rainy days! A couple of minor gripes - the room was VERY hot and although it appeared to have aircon this didn't work - despite the fairly cool weather we still needed to keep the window wide open to air the room. The design of the hotel (wooden floors) doesn't lend itself to quiet - we stayed in a similar hotel in Barcelona before and found the same thing. The breakfast looked very good - but not worth 17 euros so we opted to go elsewhere. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, or to stay here again when we next visit this wonderful city",
            "This hotel was just off \"La Rambla\" which is perfect. It's a 5 minute walk to the main action! You don't want to stay right on La Rambla in August because it's very noisy and busy. The hotel itself has excellent rooms, great breakfast and very comfortable. It has a large convenience store accross the road for your necessities (water & snacks) and a star bucks next door. It's also only a 4 blocks from La Predera and about 30 minutes walk to Sagrada familia. The only negative is that the rooms are a little on the small side but I would rather comfort, luxury and small then large and not comfortable.",
            "Cannot beat the location for this nicely furnished comfortable hotel just of the Plaza Catalunya. Close to the Ramblas without the noise and very near shopping, airport bus and tour buses. Flat screen tv, ample size rooms with comfortable beds and quiet. Only one problem. When I woke in the middle of the night to use the bathroom saw a bug in the bathroom. My only complaint. Imagine it may have come from the drain in the bathroom but still was dissappointing. In fairness to the hotel, I did not mention to the management because I didnt think there was anything they could do about this situation but did mention to housekeeping. All in all the hotel was clean",
            "The hotel has a great location near La Rambla no doubt about that but it is very noisy. We could hear when people talked in the hallway, when people flushed their toilet and when the metro passed underneath the hotel (which it did very often). The staff in the reception was very helpfull and the service was great. Overall we had a very nice trip but we expected that a 4 star hotel would be more quiet.",
            "We were seven women travelling together to celebrate a birthday. It is not easy to find rooms sleeping so many people at once, but we were able to book into a 4 and a 3 room. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, the location was really convenient and the service was great. A perfect choice for this sort of a weekend!",
            "We had 3 nights at the Regina and couldn't fault it. The rooms were excellent and the location is ideal - just off the Placa Catalunya 5 minutes from the airport bus. Staff were friendly and very helpful. We were directed to a tapas restaurant on our first night and had an excellent meal at a very reasonalbe price, not you usual hotel recommended rip-off. Nice bar downstairs. Only niggle is that breakfast is good but expensive at 16 euros per person I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a relaxed and easy stay in Barcelona",
            "Hotel Regina has great location. It is a walking distance to Las Ramblas, Plaza Catalunya, Barri Gothic, etc. The rooms are huge and clean but the bathrooms are small. The bathroom tiles are kinda old as well as the hallway tiles. There are chipping. I love the internet room . Internet is free. The lobby is just OK. The staff in the front desk are NOT so friendly. There is only one small elevator. It could accomodate only 4 people. But what turned me off with this hotel is the rate/night. Paying $200/night without breakfast is too much. There are much better hotels around the area with this rate.",
            "This hotel was located right off of Las Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya which is right where you want to stay in Barcelona. The metro picks up right down the street and if using the Aerobus from the airport you can get to this hotel for 5 euro each which drops off a block from hotel in plaza catalunya. I believe this is the central area in Barcelona. Hotel is clean... make sure you get the updated rooms. We booked 3 rooms and the two rooms which were with 2 single beds were very updated. The one we got with the double bed was a little older, bathroom was not as updated as the others but still clean. But for the price and location and the complimentary breakfast made it good for traveling with family. I would highly recommend this hotel and wish we booked it for after our cruise as well since the location was so good. Girl at the front desk was so helpful and helped us get into a triple room which i could not book online but she was able to get for me saving me from getting a 4th room for only one person since we traveled with a family of 7.",
            "As regular visitors to Barca, we have never quite found a hotel that has met our needs as well as the Regina. Family rooms are difficult to find or are ridiculously expensive. This hotel was perfect for us, a great central location with a decent sized room. What really made our stay so pleasant was the helpful staff - everyone's English was excellent and a couple of members of staff really made us feel welcome, particularly an older gentlemen who attended the front desk and showed us to our rooms (he had a twinkle in his eye) and the lady with short dark curly hair who attended to us at breakfast.",
            "Stayed at the Hotel Regina for 2 nights in August in a family room. The room was exceptionally spacious, the bathroom well stocked with towels, robes and toiletries. The beds were the most comfortable we have ever had in an hotel room anywhere in the world. Our teenage girls especially appreciated the free internet. The hotel is brilliantly situated for exploring Barcelona with most of the attractions within easy walking distance. The family room offers good value for money. The staff are very friendly and accomodating. I can thoroughly recommend the hotel.",
            "From this hotel you can get wherever you want. Actually it is in the middle of everything. Metro and busses just next, nor far from the market, the sea and the Gaudi buildings. The room was nice and clean and big. We had an excellent view. We also received a bottle of cava and chocolate from the hotel which was very nice. Sometimes it was a bit noisy in the night, you could hear the train... but that's normal for a hotel with such an excellent location. The bed was very comfortable too. Would definitely stay there again.",
            "I am an avid user of trip advisor so I felt it was time that I began to help other travelers in their hotel decision making. We travel a lot and like very nice hotels. This is hard hotel to review because there were a lot of things we liked about it and then a lot we did not. The location is EXCELLENT. Off on a side street around the corner from Las Ramblas and the Plaza Cantalunya...it can't be beat. We walked everywhere but were happy to come back at night to a more peaceful environment. I would not recommend staying on Las Ramblas at any of those hotels. The staff is very courteous and helpful Free wireless- a huge plus when traveling with young adults. The hotel itself is just moderate. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are even smaller. The decor is very minimalist. We had just come from the Westin Palace in Madrid...a true 4-5 star hotel. This hotel just isn't. There was a really weird odor coming into our room every night...almost sulphur like. There was a vent in the bathroom that vented into an interior shaft and when I closed the vent, the smell subsided somewhat. The first room we were put in had black mold on the ceiling around the A/C vent...I found it hard to get that out of my mind even though the staff gladly moved us into another room. Overall our stay at the Regina was fine...but that's it..just fine. I think there are better hotels in Barcelona in this price category.",
            "Everything about the hotel we loved: the spacious rooms, wonderful location and the helpful staff. We stayed there for 4 nights. THE ROOM: Modern and spacious (positively huge since we just came from our tiny room in Paris). The room was well appointed with two double beds, big LCD TV (some English channels), huge bathroom with bidet, separate area for sink and tub w/shower, lots of desk space. We requested a quieter room and got room 219, it was fairly quiet. Our bathroom did have a view of the back of the El Triangle sign that faced Carrer de Pelai. THE LOCATION: A block from the Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. The train, subway and airport shuttle bus are all within a blocks walking distance. The shops of Eixample and Diaganol are a close stroll. Food and drink wise are abundantly close and of varying prices and quality. There are great places to eat at everywhere. We tried to avoid eating on Ramblas since we thought it was all touristy. There is a Co-op supermarket directly across the street from the hotel. From the hotel it was an easy walk to Gothic Quarter, Barceloneta Beach, Born District, Eixample shops. THE SERVICE: We had arrived at 9:30 in the morning and the staff were very helpful getting us the best possible room. We were surprised by a bottle of champagne in our room. The manager had sent It for our 10 year anniversary. We were always greeted warmly by staff. The location of the hotel made it close to everywhere. From experience, we've come to realize location is the key to a great vacationing experience. Hotel Regina certainly has that in spades. Literally steps from all the action, yet still a quiet night rest. We could easily drop off shopping or siesta in the afternoon yet still be in the thick of things once we were ready to go. The spacious room and great staff made this one of our best stays ever!",
            "Great location, very nice hotel, lovely staff. Only problem was that the rooms had poor sound insulation. Ours was just above the bar and hence quite noisy. Ask for a room to the atrium at the end of the hallway and you should be fine. Also the quality in the bar varied quite a bit, from very good to barely okay.",
            "We stayed there for 5 nights in October 2011 in a standard double room with a small terrasse overlooking the street. The best part of this hotel is the location as it is right at the intersection of La Rambla (the main tourist strip in the Old City) and Passeig de Gracia (the main shopping street). Travelling by taxi to Placa Catalunya can be a bit bothersome at times as there were often protests and other reasons that the area around the square was blocked off from traffic. Although if you are planning on travelling by foot and metro, the location is very convenient. The area is quite noisy and the street itself is a small side street that is not very nice though. The room was on the small side but still comfortable for two people. It was very clean, with the exception of the shower that could have benefited from a soap-scum scrub down. No full length mirror unfortunately. We were happy that they gave us a room with a terrasse. Overall the room was good for a standard double. The service at the hotel was kind of poor - reception was not friendly (no smiles) and seemed a bit aggravated at times when we asked for help. Not what I was expecting from a 4 star hotel. Overall, our experience there was decent. Next time I'm in Barcelona, I would rather stay on the nearby street Rambla de Catalunya as this is much more picturesque, still perfectly located and has several nice 4-star boutique hotels.",
            "Stayed for two nights. We liked the hotel very much; friendly/service minded staff, great location, nice design in hotel/room and cool lounge. Breakfast was good with sufficient range of offers. Very central location attractive to us just next to Pla\u00e7a Catalonia, Pla\u00e7a Universitat, Las Ramblas and El Corte Ingles. Quick access to metro for reaching sightseeing goals. Our room had double balcony doors so the lively noise of Barcelona did not disturb us at least. Room door was however not very soundproof - so could hear if anyone slammed the door during night, but we slept quite well. In our view this stay was good value for money.",
            "Our one night stay at the Hotel Regina was excellent in every way. Jose Sanchez, the general manager, was extremely helpful to me prior to our stay via email. He went above and beyond in making sure we got what we requested. The rooms were very clean, modern and large for European standards and its location perfect for getting around. I would not hesitate in staying here again and would recommend this hotel to our family or friends.",
            "This palce is really great! I love how it's so conveniently located near Placa Catalunya. Just across the street there's a mini grocery, and half a block down you will find the red tour buses and the airport bus (no need to transfer!). My friend and I only had a couple of days to see barcelona so I thought booking a hotel that's central would be best. We arrived after 1AM because our flight was delayed, and they gave us a small discount which was reasonable. The whole trip was excellent, we were able to go to all the museums and parks during the day by red tour buses which starts at the Placa Catalunya (all buses passby this block), took the Metro and walked around the gothic quarters and the surrounding areas because it's really just a few blocks away. There are a few familiar shops around the area, but you can also take the tour bus that stops right across the malls. The only thing I didn't like are the cafes and some restaurants in the area. They all tasted as though they microwave just about everything. We were able to sum a lot of Barcelona in 2 days. If we stayed further out we would have spent just as much on cabs and waste time on trying to figure out the bus and train schedules. Plus the staff is great! Although the concierge didn't explain that there are TWO red bus compaines meaning TWO different line ups (which you can figure out once you get there), everything else was great.",
            "We stayed in this hotel for a week vacation in Barcelona. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, they've even organized tickets for a football match (which was quite complicated as we arrived on the match day). The hotel is modern and has all neccesary facilities, including free WiFi access. The breakfast is good, though a little variation would be welcomed. One thing to ruin it all was extremly lousy sound insulation - it sounds like walls are made of carton or something. Every day we followed the same routine - at night you cannot sleep because of neighbours returning from famous Barcelona nightlife. In the morning our wake up was set at 7:00 when the cleaning personell is starting to vacuum clean the corridor talking out loud to each other. Later, when early birds start to go for sightseeing, we could hear every word they said. All in all, the hotel management has to do something to improve this, because otherwise the hotel is mostly reccomended.",
            "After spending what felt like days googling hotels in barcelona I stumbled onto Hotel Regina and booked an early booking offer via a discount webpage. Very friendly hotel staff greeted us on arrival and directed us to our room - 408. I booked the trip for my boyfriends birthday and about 10minutes after getting settled the door went and it was a birthday cake and champagne courtesy of the hotel - very nice touch!! Rooms are lovely . Spotlessly clean and our maid done a fantastic job - coming back each night to an immaculately tidy room. Mini bar has a variety of drinks and snacks. Location is excellent - 30seconds walk from plaza catalunya. Have already recommended Hotel Regina to everyone Ive spoken to! Everything about it gets a thumbs up from me! !",
            "I arranged for our small staff to stay at the Hotel Regina during a convention in June of 2008. Even before we arrived, the staff at the hotel was very responsive to questions that we sent via email, etc. Once we arrived, I was again pleasantly surprised at how nice and helpful the staff was. The lobby was small, but very well kept and beautiful. The rooms were comfortable and really modern, clean and nice. The internet was free, so that was great as well! The hotel is in a great area, very close to the Catalonia Ramblas. It wasn't very close to the convention center, but the subway was close and easy to use.",
            "Location is great, by walk; 1min to Pl Catalunya, 3mins to La Rambla, 10-15 mins to Barri Gothic and cathedrals etc.. We did not prefer a hotel on La Rambla street, we thought it might be too loudy for sleep. So the best choice for us was around Pl Catalunya. Even on the day of new year 31.12, we slept very well although there was still new year celebrations going on Pl Catalunya. We stayed at a standart room which was clean but a little bit tiny. The room door was opening very close to our bed, that was a little uncomfortable however, at the end of the day, the size is good for a city centre based hotel. A bigger room can be an alternative. Breakfast was fine. Staff was friendly. We didnt face any problems and would definitely check for the next visit.",
            "A Hotel that started life in 1917 is bound to have issues in it's infrastructure, but this was more than compensated with the BEST staff ever ... ...although the General Manager Sr. Jose M\u00aa Sanchez-Harguindey was away, it was left in Good Hands... My sincere thanks to Rafael, Jose and especially Lucilla, who sorted out our Flight Problems with the staff at Easyjet (should be renamed Hardjet). ~ Highly recommend this Hotel and the Staff are 5*",
            "This hotel was absolutely super for what I needed. It could have been anywhere in the world, and a single room had a large single bed only (which is quite unusual in my experience). Everything was clean and tidy and there was a nice fluffy robe and slippers. The shower was good but leaked (didn't flood the bathroom), the mini bar wasn't replenished, and the balcony was just odd (see pictures), but based on what other people told me I got a bargain for where I was staying. The metro rumbles a bit underground, but certainly not enough to actually disturb my sleep. I'd definitely go back here if I went to Barcelona again.",
            "We flew in to Barcelona and had a cruise to catch the next day. The hotel was perfect. The location was right in the heart of the city. starbucks was next door and the main city square was right out the door. They offered to do anything we asked. We were shocked how helpful and kind the staff was. the bar was warm and the lobby was clean and neat. Rooms were typical for a city. They were very clean and neat. Bathrooms were very modern and more than functionable. We are looking forward to finding a reason to go back to Barcelona and enjoy their hospitality for a longer stay. When we returned back from the cruise they stored our luggage until our flight . no charge... Very class act. they sold us on how to treat a guest - Not sure anyone can match their quality but we do travel a bit so we are using them for a benchmark. They also corrdinated private drivers to meet us everywhere we asked",
            "Overall the hotel was of a good standard, however there were several things that really let it down and caused us (the customer) more hassle than we wanted. When we arrived early the staff appeared to be quite accomodating and gave us a room key etc - when we got to the room it was appalling, next to a cleaner's cupboard and with no window - it was small and not worthy of the 118 euros my now fiancee (he proposed in Barcelona) paid for it. After going back to reception I said that I was not happy with the room, the staff member (whose name was maybe Sr. Jose?) did not argue but said ok, as I began to justify why I wanted to change he was quite rude and did not listen to my reasons which outlined what we wanted. He offered us another room but said we'd need to wait until it was clean - that was fine and we went for a stroll. When we got back his colleague (who was really nice) showed us the room - we still weren't happy with it really, it had a window but no view as it was behind a billboard. I said that this was a birthday treat and could he not organise a nicer room for us. He was again very rude and ignored what I'd said but claimed that this was the last room in the hotel! We reluctantly accepted the room and did have a really nice time in Barcelona. When we checked out two days later the staff were so friendly and polite, as were the breakfast staff who served us. The location is brilliant, the breakfast is brilliant, rooms vary, the actual standard is good but some have either no window or decent view, the staff vary - some were brilliant some were really rude and unwelcoming, with lack of understanding for customer service. Seriously dampened the start of our visit to Barcelona!",
            "Stayed at the Hotel Regina in May for 3 nights. I booked two rooms and I couldn't have been happier with the two rooms we were allocated. The rooms were really spacious and modern and both had great outlooks and even although both rooms were to the front of the hotel they were both really quiet at night. One of the rooms was for my brother and I booked this on a \"double room for single occupancy rate\" and I have to say it was well worth booking this room. I had emailed ahead with specific requiremets and they were met in every way. Every member of staff, from reception to bar staff were extremely professional and helpful. We used the facilities of the adjoining Pulitzer hotel, ie. roof top bar and courtyard, if we returned during the day, and on returning to the hotel later on in the evening used the bar area at the Regina. On returning to the UK I wrote to the Manager to thank him and his staff and received a really nice response from him, which I wasn't expecting. I had such a good time in Barcelona and was so happy with the hotel that I couldn't even say goodbye to the staff as we left as I was crying!! Would most definitely return to this hotel.",
            "We had a terrific time in this hotel. It was clean, comfortable and a nice size for our family (two adults and two children), especially by European standards. Very close for a nice stroll to the Plaza Cataluna and Las Ramblas. Near Casa Batllo as well. We stayed here prior to our cruise and found it convenient to the port area. We loved the free wifi internet access as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again when we return to glorious Barcelona.",
            "The Hotel Regina is in the perfect location, just around the corner from \"Las Ramblas\", and directly across the street from the Metro. It's an older Hotel, but was tidy with clean rooms and a nice lounge area. However, I would not recommend this Hotel, as the walls are paper thin and we could hear every sound made by the housekeeping staff and other Hotel guests. We booked four rooms for our extended Christmas family vacation, for 9 adults and 1 child. The housekeeping staff staging area was located on our floor. This consisted of an archaic service elevator and supply room, which was accessed from early morning until evening daily. The loud clanking continued throughout the day and evening for our entire 9 day stay. Although the housekeeping staff and bartenders were wonderful, I was shocked that the front desk staff refused to ask our upstairs neighbor to refrain from allowing their child to run sprints back and forth in the hall at 2 am, on the floor above. We were told, \"we can't help you with that., but we can give you their room number and you can call yourself if you'd like.\" You could literally hear every minute sound. The bare hardwood floors and thin walls made getting a goodnight sleep nearly impossible! This would not be the place for honeymooners. On a brighter note, although there is no restaurant on site, delicious meals are available via room service from the Hotel next door. The food is very good and the prices are reasonable.",
            "We tried this hotel during a 2night stopover on the basis of previous trip advisor reviews & completely satisfied with all aspects. The hotel staff were friendly & courteous, spotless rooms with large well equipped bathrooms. The location was ideal for all tourist attractions & 2min walk to the main bus area for connections to nearby attractions.",
            "Great price, great service, nice clean rooms (somewhat modern too), and PRIME location, 5 minutes walk from Las Ramblas and walkable to the seaport/pier on a mild day. Not to mention there is a metro, hop off/on bus and Aerobus right down the street and around the corner from convenient shopping.",
            "We were here for 3 days last month and thouroughly enjoyed our time. Barcelona has so many beautiful sights and this hotel is in the ideal location to walk, hail a cab, or take the metro. The staff was helpful and friendly and gave us great tips for restaurants, especially Brasseria Flo. We ate there twice! We did eat at the breakfast buffet and as mentioned, there were limited hot choices. The fresh fruit and pastries were nice as well as the Iberian ham. it was not worth 16E each, possibly 10E would be more appropriate. The beds and pillows were comfy. The shampoo, lotions, etc were of good quality. We did not watch tv, but there seemed to be a few English choices. There was a little noise/movement from the metro. We will certainly stay here again.",
            "This hotel is in a really good location at the top of Las Ramblas and very convenient for the excellent airport buses to the main airport (but equally convenient for Reus or Girona as so close to Placa Catalunya). Really convenient for the Tour bus, walking to anywhere, the train and or local buses. Our room was spacious with bath and shower, robes and slippers, chocolate left on the overturned sheet on the bed. Check in was easy and pleasant even though we arrived at getting on for midnight, bar staff pleasant (although its expensive in the bar), efficient cleaning, helpful reception staff, easy check out. The only fault you could make from my perspective is that Barcelona is an incredibly noisy city all through the night and this hotel is equally a victim of that - but I can't see how you can get away from that unless you stay way out of town. I would definitely stay here again. I am a regular traveller to Barcelona and this is the best of the hotels I have stayed in for the price. Oh and as an added extra you can use the internet easily and freely.",
            "Stayed twice at the Regina within the space of 10 days (pre and post cruise)and found its location at the top of the Ramblas and next to Catalunya Square to be excellent for shopping,buses,taxis and general sightseeing. Despite other peoples experiences with the staff we found them to be efficient and helpful BUT you get what you put in so maybe a bit of courtesy towards them would pay dividends when you want early check ins and somewhere to hold your cases after you checkout or taxis,information etc. Anyway down to the Hotel itself the Public areas are pleasant and well kept there is a small free internet cafe.The breakfasts looked good but we did not have any as they are pricey and you can just wander out and go to nearby cafes anyway. The room themselves were probably chic/fashionable/minimalist when it opened 10/12 years ago but now whilst they are clean and functional they are worn around the edges and like the towels slightly frayed.I would also agree with other reviewers that the sound insulation is poor. We stayed in a large family room with our two young children and have no issues with it as we got a good rate, just take the online pictures with a pinch of salt. I do not know how the Hotel rating system works but this is a 3 star not 4 star Hotel. Would we stay there again yes, but not for more than a couple of days.",
            "I stayed here for 4 nights when I came for a trade show and fortunately, as I was here for business, didn't stay in the room or hotel very much. I actually made a booking at Pulitzer Hotel, which is the sister hotel of Regina, and literally next door. But he Pulitzer was full, so they booked me a room at the Regina instead. The best things I would say is the fantastic location of the hotel, which is a short walk to Ramblas or Paseo de Gracia, with great shopping. The other good things are the reasonable rate of the hotel and the impressive lobby, which feels like a grand old hotel. However, once you pass the lobby and go towards the rooms, you come to a tiny lift (only one lift!) so be prepared to wait and if there are 2 of you with luggage, its a tight squeeze. Then the rooms ... you start to feel the age and tiredness of the rooms when you step in. Room size is also on the small side. Opt for rooms in the front, at least you'll have a window. My room was at the back and there was a tiny window in the corner, facing a brick wall. Can be depressing if you don't walk out of the hotel to look at the sky. If you need a drink, its better to walk next door to the Bar at the Pulitzer, which seems more civilized and lively. Personally, I wouldn't come back to stay here as there are so many other great choices in Barcelona. For a similar location and type of hotel, I would probably opt for Pulitzer or Jazz Hotel next time.",
            "Just back from a superb stay at the Hotel Regina. The hotel could not be any more central or better located than it is from both La Ramblas and the shopping. The hotel is beautiful, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms great, slightly small but perfect for what we needed. Cleaned everyday and central heating was great. Have been recommending the hotel already! Still cannot believe the price we paid for the location and the quality. Overall had an excellent stay and will definately be back.",
            "Perfect location - just off Placa de Catalunya, right at the heart of Barcelona. Room was small but very clean and tastefully furnished (although lacking a full size mirror). Very comfortable bed. A functional modern bathroom. Free internet in the lounge area. Breakfast - buffet style, varied, good quality food. We recommend this hotel. with confidence.",
            "The Hotel Regina was almost perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful and very polite. The hotel itself is quite beautiful inside. The decor is in dark, earthy colors, giving it a warm and cozy feeling. Everything is extremely clean. In comparison to the rest of the hotel, the room was a bit disappointing. We had booked a double room and though immaculate, it was very cramped. The minimalist decor would have been better if everything hadn't been just black and white. As there were construction works going on outside the hotel, the room's window provided us with absolutely no natural light. This made the room seem very dark even in the middle of the day. It did make for a good night's sleep though. The rooms were comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was good. There was something for everyone. The breakfast room staff didn't speak English which proved to be difficult for some people. I speak Spanish but my friend didn't, so when I came down for breakfast my friend was struggling to explain to the staff member that coffee had run out in the decanter. Funny for me, maybe not so much for others. If you're staying with friends or family this is a good hotel to stay at. The location is excellent and the staff is really nice. If this is a romantic getaway, then I would recommend staying somewhere else. Tiniest bathtub ever!",
            "I would rate the Hotel Regina much closer to a three-star than a four-star property. It's obvious that they've undergone some renovations (lobby and bar area are nicely furnished), but a coat of paint and updated IKEA furnishings do not a four star property make. The location of the hotel is excellent -- great things w/in walking distance and one-half block from the Metro. The common areas (especially the hallways) are right out of a 1970's B-movie set: cheap carpet, wood-panel doors, institutional color palette, etc. The amenities are limited and cheap (no soap for the shower?). The sinks (there were 2 sinks in our room) were located as part of the living/sleeping area (common layout for European and Asian hotels). One of our sinks was perpetually clogged. We notified the front desk of this problem but they failed to correct it during our 3 night stay. Although there was plenty of hot water for the shower, because the glass \"door\" extended along only one-third the length of the bathtub, the result was a very drafty shower. There was an itty bitty balcony with our room w/ enough space for two people to stand upright (but certainly no sitting) that had a very nice view of the \"Triangle,\" the area just beyond Placa Catalunya. The hotel is woefully understaffed. There was no doorman or porter/bellhop so we were left to our own struggles to get our many bags through the front door and up the stairs to the aging (and SMALL) elevator. They had a business centre w/ free and fast internet access but we did occasionally have issues w/ WiFi from the room. Generally, an adequate hotel, but doesn't live up to other Spanish (including Barcelona) four star properties.",
            "srcit76 Wilmington, DE Based on recommendations found here we stayed two nights prior to a cruise. No regrets.The location, on a quiet street with it's proximity to the Placa de Catalunya, La Ramblas and restaurants was perfect. Our room, facing the street on the fifth floor was very clean and the beds comfortable. Excellent lighting to read in bed but no so at the desk. The only negative was a leaky shower door that puddled water on the floor. A very friendly and helpful staff. We would stay here again. (Note: The floor plan posted on the door did show some rooms to be quite small. Those facing the street are much larger).",
            "Rooms were small but had everything we needed. We traveled with another couple, and our room was twice the size of theirs. The computer lounge was nice. The proximity to Plaza de Catalunya and Las Ramblas is perfect. You are paying for the location. Close to metro, 15 minute ride to beach, you need to switch trains once. I would recommend this hotel.",
            "I have stayed for four nights at this fabulous hotel . The hotel is located just 1 minutes walk from the Plaza Catalunya square and the metro station. The easiest way to get to the hotel from the airport is using the Aerobus shattle, it's a direct bus from the airport to the city center, the last station is the Plaza Catalunya square, it's cost only 8 euro for a retorn ticket that valid up to 9 days. Tha hotel staff wad so delightful and they were always willing to help answer my questions or provide recommendations. The room was very clean and comfort with a free WIFI, a air-condition and even a bathrobe and slippers, it's was so nice to came back to the room after a long day out.",
            "We had an excellent stay for a long weekend in Barcelona. Location: Very convenient for the major atrractions and the Bus Turistic which picks up from Placa del Cataluyna. Also in a lovely area to walk to local restaurants etc. Rooms: Clean, classy and well laid out, we were not bothered by the noise of other guests or outside. The only thing was the faint rumbling of the occasional underground train. There is also a free internet lounge. Staff: Excellent and only too happy to help, they went out of their way to help when my husband was ill. The also organised our departure. In summary, we highly recommend the Hotel Regina for your next stay in Barcelona!",
            "My mom and I stayed at a twin room at Hotel Regina in mid April. We picked this hotel for its location and we weren't disappointed. Everything was either walking or subway ride away, subway station was definitely less than 5 minutes walk away. The staff was OK but they sure made us wait when checking in (previous group was large and took forever). The room was rather small (we got room 211). I think we were facing the back side of the hotel but couldn't tell too well because there was only one tiny, narrow window facing walls with hardly any light coming in. The lighting in the room was fine, so we didn't feel all that bad, but a view would have been nice. We did hear some subway noise during the day time, but that didn't wake us up early or anything. Also, the room was kept quite warm, so we didn't even need the blankets when trying to sleep. The bonus was free access to 3 computers at business center-I wasn't expecting it, so it was nice to have. And there was a little supermarket right across the street, which made it easy for us to buy water and other snack items. Overall, I thought the hotel was clean, modern looking and in a great central location. Ideally, the room could have been bigger and with more natural light, but for busy travelers just needing a place to sleep, it was very nice.",
            "Sorry I am taking so long to review this hotel after my stay in March 2010. I will preface this review by saying that I live in Europe and have stayed in hundreds of hotels in the region. I'm accustomed to small rooms, and I think I'm a reasonable reviewer of hotels. I don't require top-notch luxury if I'm not paying a lot of money. But I have to say this was the worst room I've had in a highly rated TripAdvisor hotel and a terrible experience given the amount of money we spent for the room. After seeing other reviewers' photos, I see that perhaps my experience was unusual, but be warned that it could be you next time. Granted, we chose the least expensive room when booking, but even the least expensive room at this rate should have been better. My girlfriend and I checked in late and after waiting 15 minutes for the front desk employee to get off the phone, we were given a terribly small, dark, depressing, windowless room. I say windowless, but it actually did have a tiny high window that opened a little into a crawlspace/alley that was perpetually dark. The room itself was stark with the bed taking up almost the entire space. The bathroom was equally unimpressive. We asked immediately for a room change, but the front desk employee said that no others were available that night. He said he would switch the room in the following day or two. Every day we checked back, but to no avail. The only positive I can say about the hotel was that the entry way and common areas were nicely designed in a modern style. And it had a good location for touring. But we wanted nothing to do with the hotel and strived to be out as much as possible. I do not recommend that you choose this hotel.",
            "We spent Easter time at hotel Regina with children. It has great location, only few steps from Rambla and Plaza Catulunya and that's why we chose this hotel. Staff and also interior of the hotel is nice but we were little bit disapointed from family room. We had family room on the 4th floor and it was not very spacious and comfortable. But every other things were ok...",
            "We stayed here a day early prior to leaving on a Mediterranean Cruise. We had heard bad things about Barcelona hotel and were not sure what to expect. We were greeted by exceptionally helpful and friendly staff. Every one we came in contact with spoke English except for the bartender. Our lost luggage was tracked down by staff members and delivered to our room when it arrived. Our room had a king size bed, beautiful bathroom and a sitting room. Very clean with all the amenities. The only bad thing I could say was noise from the hallway filtered into the room quite a bit. As it was pouring rain we decided to eat in the bar area. The food was fantastic and the service was quick and efficient. The hotel location is a very short walking distance to the Ramblas. A great cultural and good shopping experience.",
            "excellent location, central. top of las ramblas, close to all public transport including train, underground and buses. definitely 4 stars and also rooms of high quality. Good service too. In summary, value for money, quality, great location - what more do you need in a hotel for a city break",
            "I normally stay in the Pulitzer hotel next door which is a sister hotel and represents far better value for money than Regina which is really showing its age. Locataion is great for either business or tourists so that is a major plus but the regina is not as good value as the Pulitzer. Rooms and public spaces are definitely very tired and room service menu is very limited (no restaurant) - breakfast was decent but due to a conference in town at the time the cost for my room was prohibitively expensive",
            "I ended up with a reservation at this hotel instead of its sister property, Hotel Pulitzer (right next door). So, watch the website link you are taken to...to ensure you're reserving at your preferred property. The accommodations at Hotel Regina were fine though it does lack luster in terms of decor. The room I had was simple and not one to 'hang-out' in. It served as a home base and for sleeping primarily. The excellent room rate obtained was due to the room being located just over an underground transportation line that didn't shut down until about midnight and would start up about 6:00a.m. the following morning. I was so tired from jetlag and being on the go, that the first few nights...this didn't bother me. But over the 8 nights of my stay, there were a couple nights when it was a bit annoying. Overall, the room was clean, and desk staff were helpful. There was no breakfast included with my room rate.",
            "Really nice hotel. The room was a bit on the small side, but the fixtures were new and stylish. The minibar had decent prices for that, and the wireless internet was free. The location, 50 meters from the Plaza Catalunya was unbeatable. From there you can access a major Metro station and the cheap (5 euro) bus to the airport from the front of El Corte Ingles department store. The Rambla is right outside your door, major Gaudi edifices are a short walk away. My buddy found the location noisy and found it hard to sleep, but I didn't notice. We got the room for about $150 a night. I say it was a major deal.",
            "Surly check in clerk. Air con did not work despite complaining twice. Not one good nights sleep in 3 night stay due to non existent sound proofing between rooms and corridor. If you like the sound of slamming doors, stay here, otherwise spend your euros more wisely. 2nd attempt to review this hotel so hopefully this one will get shown!",
            "We stayed at Hotel Regina for 2 nights just last weekend. Location was excellent and close to everything. Our room was spacious, very clean and quite (considering we were right off the main shopping area). The staff were helpful and friendly. I will definitley be returning to Barcelona and with that will be returning to the Hotel Regina.",
            "We spent 6 nights at the Hotel Regina, and chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. It was not as good as we had expected it to be, mainly because we were given a poor quality room. Pros: Excellent location next to Placa Catalunya - easy walk to Las Ramblas/the beach/all transport links and aerobus etc Comfortable beds and quiet room which was clean Free wifi Nice, relaxing bar area with very helpful waiter who fed us free crisps etc when we were having wine Bathrobes and slippers provided in rooms (both huge) Cons: We were given a very small, cramped room. There was no view from the window (see photo)and no sunlight into the room. We couldn't tell what the weather was like from our room. Despite asking for a non-smoking room, our room smelt strongly of stale cigarette smoke and other people's smoke came through the air conditioning into our room. No kettle to make a cup of tea No iron/board in room - although staff did provide us with this on request. Safety of iron questionable (see photo) Didn't always replace toiletries in room Reception staff variable in terms of helpfulness. Our room phone didn't work and wasn't fixed during our stay. Small shower-room, with water from shower escaping onto floor. Overall, if you are looking for a no-frills, central hotel close to all transport links, then Hotel Regina is probably worth considering. If you like a bit of luxury on your holiday, probably best avoided. In our view, not worthy of its four star status and more like a three star.",
            "We had an overnight in Barcelona before the start of our NCL cruise. We chose the Hotel Regina for its location a block from Placa Catalunya and the start of Las Ramblas. When we checked in, they gave us a superior room, which had plenty of space for the two of us with double beds and a then a couch in an alcove area. The room and large bathroom were clean and orderly. The breakfast buffet had a wide variety of options although the restaurant is not clearly marked, You had to walk through a doorway by the bar and then go pass the toilets to find it. The one negative comment would be that the space between the beds and the wall unit did not allow for luggage to be rolled through. I had to lift them over the beds to get to the other side. It was only a few blocks to the Gothic area and the two wonderful churches there, the Cathedral and Santa Maria del Mar. The Hard Rock is right on Placa Catalunya as well. We walked from the Hotel to the end of Las Ramblas to catch the cruise terminal shuttle right across from the Columbus monument. (olny took 30 minutes and that was with stopping at a few shops along the way) We would not hesitate going to this hotel again.",
            "We had a group of four of us - no couples - so really appreciated the \"family room\" we were able to get here (for a reasonable price). It was very spacious and clean and had a big bathroom and lots of room to spread out. Sadly we only stayed one night but we had excellent service from the very friendly staff. We asked a lot of questions for getting around Barcelona and they were extremely helpful. They also have a room (and great organization) where you can lock your bags up securely if needed (we checked out but were not heading to our cruise ship until late in the day). One reason we chose this hotel was the location but we did worry about the noise - there was no need to! It was quiet even with the location so close to Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas! I would definitely stay here again! Oh and the beds were quite comfortable!",
            "Last year we went to Barcelona because we were going on a cruise. Checked the reviews about this hotel and did not regret choosing it. Very close to the Rambla, restaurants and some shopping, and bus stations. There is a Corte Ingles walking distance. Very clean and comfortable beds.",
            "hotel is clean, the service is fine although variable. We stayed in a large room, well equipped with a spacious bathroom and bedroom. Dont use the rooms near the triangle especially 1st floor-the trains rumble the floor regardless if your windows are shut. dont use the laundry service unless your willing to part with more money than your clothes are worth. Overall-depends on what deal you got for your room, because despite the cons the location is very convenient.",
            "What a gem of a hotel, so close to everything and such large rooms. Such good value for money and the little extras are so sweet, there are dressing gowns and new slippers awaiting in the bathroom and even lady and gentleman packs, for those little bits you might have forgotten. The hotel itself could do with lighter decoration as there are always lights on due to a lot of dark wood but that is a small price to pay. The staff are very smiley and extremely courteous, very accomodating and friendly. Well done, customer service at its best. Thank you.",
            "We stayed at Regina for 3 nights after a Mediterranean cruise. The staff was excellent specially Carmen. It's location is fantastic, just a couple of blocks away from las /Ramblas, but you don't have the noisy of the crowd of Las Ramblas. However with the rooms, they are very closed to each other and at night when you come back to restetimes you can hear the conversations and noises from your neighboors. Also the doors don't close normally, you have to bang them to get them properly closed. This is really a problem, because after 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning you can hear these noices from guest leaving the hotel and you feel they are happening in your own room.Before our cruise we stayed for 2 nights at another 2 stars guesthouse, and didnot have to confront this situation.In all this is the only complaint we have, an very honest not good for what we paid. Jose L. Perez (stayed from 10-10-10 th. 10-13-10",
            "Have just returned from a 2 night stay, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The location of this hotel is perfect. It's right in the centre of the city, so a perfect starting point to explore. And also very easy to get back to - all types of transport are right outside. From the moment we arrived, the staff were very helpful and efficient. The room was an unusual shape but an acceptable size. The beds were comfy. Our only complaint was being located right next to the infamous housekeeping cupboard, and therefore heard every door open and close as the staff went about their work in the early hours. To be fair, we didn't mention this to management, as we were only there for 2 nights and didn't want the hassle of changing our room. The staff were very helpful in letting us store our luggage after checking out, for nearly a whole day. Also, no free wine or chocolates in the room, as others have noted. We felt safe and secure in and outside the hotel at all times, which was nice, being 2 females. I would recommend this hotel highly.",
            "Our son had to be hospitalized. We were in US & didn't speak language. Andrea, Alberto, and Rafael were unbelievable - translating with hospital, assisting in middle of night when he returned. They went above & beyond without hesitation. My son says the hotel is beautiful & great location.",
            "Thank you to Mr. Sanchez for accommodating all our requests - room with balcony, early check-in, non-smoking floor. Since we also informed him that it was our anniversay, he had a bottle of Cava and chocolate covered pistachios in the room when we arrived - very classy and thoughtful touch. Thank you again. Wonderful, charming front desk staff - very helpful, friendly and well informed - most especially Raffa and Manuel. Suggested great restaurants - Cinc Sentits, Espai Sucre (dessert place), and Olive - all exquisite cuisine in the new Spanish style plus a couple of more traditional ones - Cal Pep and Cerveceria Catalunya (which we all went to and recommend highly) he also let us know what to avoid as tourist traps - helpful information anywhere you travel. Perhaps the noise problem has been addressed since talking and other noise from cleaning staff was kept to a minimum and did not bother us at all. There were double windows on the balcony which overlooked the street and so no noise penetrated from outside either. The rooms are clean, well-kept, well-stocked and had more than adequate space for two people. The bed was comfortable (as they say, when travelling, it is all about the bed) and afforded us several good nights' sleep after a long day of exploring. The hotel is centrally located between the old town (Rambla, Born and Barrio Gothic) and the new areas (Eixample) but on a quiet street. Getting to either place was so easy since all transportation was just half a block away (including the airport bus) on Plaza Catalunya, although I think Barcelona is a walking town and we highly recommend doing this. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff is very responsive and will address any of your questions and concerns in a very professional but friendly manner.",
            "Very good hotel located in a quiet street less than 100 m form piazza Cataluna and the metro stop, and walking distance to the Ramblas. Spacious rooms, very good amenities. Friendly and helpful staff specially Luis at the front desk. I recommend this hotel.",
            "Our first trip to Barcelona and I chose the Hotel Regina for our stay. From the initial communication with the hotel's gracious manager, Jos\u00e9 M\u00aa Sanchez, through our checkout, the experience was outstanding. The property is located just off the Placa Catalunya which provides VERY easy access from the airport. Hop on the A-1 bus (blue) and in just minutes you are there walking a short distance to the hotel (look for the blue banner on the side of the building). Having arrived in the morning I was quite pleased after the long flight that our room was available upon arrival and check-in was very pleasant and efficient. Our 5th floor room was spacious, contemporary and very comfortable (pictures posted) and the bathroom was good sized. As previously reported here, the bedding is very comfortable. The location of rhe property is fantastic for visiting the city sites as it is an easy walk to the historic areas and La Rambla. Also, the Bus Turistic (hop on hop off service) launches from the Placa Catalunya so gettting around the city from the hotel is very, very easy. We found each staff person at the hotel eager to help, very knowledgeable and very friendly. Our travels brought us back to Barcelona for the night before our flight home and we were happy to return to the Hotel Regina for our last night. The room we had this time was an interior room and was much smaller than our initial room but was comfortable and met our needs for the night. I don't know when our travels might bring us back to Barcelona but when we return, I happily know I have a home away from home in Barcelona.",
            "Stayed at the Hotel Regina again this year and was not disappointed. Great service and a surprise welcome back gift of Champagne and Chocolates. I do not know if they do this for everyone, not that I'm special, but a neat surprise. The entire staff went over backwards to make our stay excellent.",
            "Hotel Regina is well situated just off the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas, but close enough. Staff was very professional and helpful. We had a very late flight the evening of our check-out and they took care of our 4 large suitcases until we were ready to leave. Beds were comfortable and bathroom toiletries were well appointed, including robes and slippers. The sink in the room was not the best idea in the floor plan. Overall, a good hotel. Many options for breakfast near by since hotel breakfast was overpriced. The rooms could use some refurbishing as wear and tear can be seen. Not a very big deal though.",
            "My family of 4 stayed in a family room for 3 nights from 8th October. The room was very large and clean with very comfortable beds. The position of the hotel was excellent as it is situated just around the corner from Plaza Catalunya with all the transport faciities and restaurants on the doorstep. On arrival we found that my daughter had left her mobile phone in the taxi ... but i would like to thanks the hotel staff for their help and consideration as they offered and helped us with trying to get the phone back. (Thankfully, we did manage to contact the finder and get it back). We did not have breakfast at the hotel as the price of 16 euros per person seemed expensive (a family of 4 costing 64 euros). However, there were plenty of places close by which were great for breakfast at reasonable value. The hotel went to great lengths to ensure that we had a great stay for our Wedding anniversary. Thank you Mr Sanchez .. we loved your hotel and your kind hospitality and I would certainly stay there again when we return and would recommend it to others. Thanks !",
            "My daughter and I stayed here on a sight seeing trip to Barcelona. We found the Hotel to be centrally located, easy access to Catalunya Square, from where you can visit most of the tourist sites. Our room, was large, good bathroom, only downside was that it faced buildings at the back of the Hotel. No view. Room was clean and adequately furnished for a few days stay. Bedside rug did need a good steam clean!! Trendy looking, comfortable bar, though on a Monday night this was very, very, quiet. After leaving for the airport, we discovered we'd left a mobile phone in the bedroom. On contacting Reception from the airport, we luckily heard it had been found and would be posted back to us. It arrived safe and sound 2 weeks later. Many, many thanks to those concerned at Reception. Would recommend this Hotel, but ask for a room with a view and a little iron balcony.",
            "Since we already found a quad room at Saint James Albany Hotel in Paris, I wanted to get another one in Barcelona, Spain. And I found it at the Regina Hotel. The location is conveniently located without the noise of Las Ramblas but walking distance to everything else. It was the perfect location. It even had white bathrobes for the four of us. I felt like I was in the privacy of my own home. Talk about making you feel at \"home!\" Try to find out which days they have a discount and plan your trip around it if your dates are flexible. Their breakfast is not included in the room rates but be adventurous and eat out. It's also cheaper to eat the breakfast buffet outside. Barcelona is a party city. You can't be bored here. People are very friendly. The hotel staff was so accommodating with our requests. They will do everything they can to help you with your questions. I'd strongly recommend this hotel especially if there's 4 of you and you want to share the cost. You will have the time of your life here. Also, don't forget to eat your churros with hot choclate or you'll be sorry. We wondered if there's a buffet for dinner in Barcelona and yes there is. If you love meat....it's a feast! And sangria accompanies every meal. You will love this place. Don't miss Monserrat up in the mountains. Just take the train and ask the hotel staff how to get there. Be careful with the pickpocketers. They can spot the tourists who wears their shorts.",
            "Location is fabulous! Get the aerobus from the airport and the hotel is literally a few minutes walk from Place Catalunya (head for the street with Habitat on the corner). Our room was small but very clean and well decorated. Bathrobes and slippers were provided and the toiletries were very good. We booked direct with the hotel and I advised them that it was my husband's 40th birthday - on our first night, a complimentary bottle of Cava was delivered to our room! This was a total surprise and such a lovely gesture - thank you Hotel Regina! The reception staff were also very helpful when we made enquiries about the Metro system. I wouldnt even consider looking for another hotel in Barcelona",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Regina for two nights after returning to Barcelona on our cruise ship. The best part about this hotel is location, location, location... The hotel is located a half-block from the central Plaza Cataluna (spelling ?) and one block from the Las Ramblas district. A subway station, the Aero bus stop (direct to Barcelona airport) and the multi-story Corte de Ingles department store are at the plaza. Located on a side street, the hotel avoids much of the street noise common to other hotels in the area. Our 5th floor room was spacious, clean and had a small balcony overlooking the street. We appreciated the 5 computers which were available for use by guests. The hotel's full-service bar also served delicious tapas and small plate options. A breakfast buffet -- available for about 13 euros ($17 US) -- offered a nice array of food and beverage options. There was no valet service -- at least no one offered to help us move 2 large bags from the sidewalk to our room. The front desk staff spoke good English and made several useful suggestions on where to eat and where to go. Given its central location, this hotel provides an excellent value for travelers. Not an especially romantic setting.",
            "We stayed at the Regina for two nights in late June. We had a double room, (2 beds), our children and grandchildren had a quad room (4 beds). The hotel is right off Plaza Catalyuna and the main thoroughfare Las Ramblas. It was quiet (except for the night that Spain won the world cup), the rooms were modern, clean and beautiful. Bathrooms were crisp and clean. The complimentary bathrobes were a plus. Their small bar is quiet and perfect to relax in after a day of sightseeing. They will arrange for sandwiches and small meals upon request. The internet is free, with 3 provided computers. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, answering our questions and providing taxi calls and restaurant recommendations. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms fairly large. Although not inexpensive, it compares very favorably with any 4 star hotel in New York City...indeed the rooms are larger and cleaner. We would be happy to use this hotel again.",
            "The room was simple but comfortable for the four of us (two teenagers 15 and 13). The beds were GREAT!!! The room temperature perfect. The room was clean. At night, it was quiet even though we were footsteps from loud Las Ramblas Street. It was an ideal location. Starbucks around the corner.........Las Ramblas around the other corner.........Hop on Hop off tour bus a block away. Close to restaurants, shopping and sight seeing. Quick cab ride to the ship - it was perfect for our needs. Would recommend without hesitation.",
            "Good location right at the top of ramblas. The staff were very dismissive, but I think that was the language barrier because they had very poor English and tourist skills!, Not much else to say really! Try somewhere else if you want good help with touristy stuff.",
            "We stayed for 4 nights in August for first time Barcelona tourism, which entitled to us to a long stay discount (probably regarded as quite expensive otherwise). The location is very good - Passeig de Gracia where the renfe trains from airport connects is very close, and perfectly located by the Placa Catalunya for walkable access to both the new town (for Gaudi architectures) and the old town (for catedral and la rambra) and restaurants are great. Staff were capable of speaking English but occasionally difficult to communicate - otherwise very friendly and helpful. Good selection was provided for breakfast and the fact that it was available from 7-12 was very handy. 3 computers available in the lounge for free access to internet was useful too. The rooms were generally modern, simple and clean, and the beds were comfortable but quite small and bathrooms were somewhat moldy... Something I wouldn't have expected from four star hotel. We were also allocated a disabled facilitated room which was more inconvenient to get around, let alone it was already small, because of the extra handles etc. Also beware of the thin walls - you can hear the people next door and the movements in the corridor. Good enough if you just need a comfortable bed to sleep in after a long day of walking,",
            "Stayed here for one night at the end of a 3 week trip to Spain. Staff at the reception desk were helpful with any requests or questions. However, I had booked a double room in advance, and confirmed it was a double at check-in, but when I got to the room, it was a twin. When I phoned reception to see what was going on, they told me that a booking for a double room is only treated as a REQUEST for a double. Huh??? Hotel Regina & I obviously have different concepts of what a confirmed booking is. They did find a double room for me, so it was all fine after that. Free internet access in the business centre near the hotel bar was great. Overall, I don't have any complaints about the hotel, but nor is it one I would rave about. Perfectly adequate sums it up.",
            "I had heard not to expect much from the hotels in Europe. Well I can tell you that is not the case with the Hotel Regina. Renting the Superior room was as good as any in America. The rooms were spacious with king sized bed; new and modern baths; remodeled rooms; very relaxing lobby bar and great location...Just a block off of the Rambles. And, not a horrible price. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona.",
            "A friend of mine and I stayed at the Hotel Regina for 3 days in August. The rooms were clean and spacious (something unexpected after we had just come from Paris). The best part of the hotel may be the location. It's a block away from Placa Catalyuna (where the Aerobus is located), shopping, and Las Ramblas. If you don't have to pay full price for a room (we used a expedia vacation package and got it for cheap) then it might be one of the best deals in Barcelona!",
            "As with previous reviews, the location was great. RIght off of La Rambla, close to shopping (el Corte Ingles) and the metro. The staff and service was all great. We had a triple room and it was beautiful, modern...but the bathroom was a real dissappoinment. A hotel of this caliber (and price) I would have liked a nicer bathroom/shower. The tub/shower door was so short that the minute you turned on the shower, water gets all over the bathroom. Plus, the rubber seal at the bottom the short shower door was nonexistant so water would hit the glass and go right out all over the floor. It was no wonder there was a drain in the middle of the bathroom floor and 2 shower mats provided! I'm positive it wasn't user error as you can see mold growing along the edges of the bathroom floor. Considering the price we paid per night...this was a real dissappoinment and I can only rate it average.",
            "Stayed in the hotel for one night for sightseeing in Barcelona. Room 220 spacious, big bed seperate area with day bed/3rd bed. Immaculate bathroom, bathrobes etc. & soooo quiet. Dare I have a tiny complaint, diffuculty getting BBC World on the plasma to catch up on the Credit news at home. Otherwise the Hotel scored 11 out of 10",
            "We stayed at the Regina during 2 nights for a week-end getaway for my 45th birthday early Sept. In all, this hotel is OK and what you would expect of a 4 star city hotel. Nothing special but nice design. Husband, myself and our teenage daughter shared a 'family room'. It was spacious and nicely decorated with modern dark wood furniture. We were pleasantly surprised that we did not hear the traffic - the hotel is located right in the middle at the top of La Rambla and therefore quite a lot of traffic noise. However, inside, the hotel is very poorly insulated. We were unlucky to have the cleaner's cupboard just outside our room and at 07:00 in the morning we heard everything they did and said ... very annoying! There is a 1.5 cm gap under the door which makes anything said in the corridor like if said inside your room. While fully equipped with bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, towels etc for 3 people (which is good, you usually have to remind housekeeping of the third person), we thought the bathroom was very small and the double sink next to the bed was weird. Since the bathroom/room obviously had been remodelled, it would have been better to move the wall across and include the sinks within the bathroom. We enjoyed Barcelona very much. Beautiful city with lots to do and see for a week-end getaway and warm temperatures still in September. We even spent an afternoon on the beach. The sister hotel Pulitzer next door has a much nicer bar. Can be recommended. We'll probably stay at the Pulitzer next time.",
            "I wanted to visit Barcelona for my Birthday weekend and as such researched a whole range of different hotels in the city. I was very impressed when I saw on the tripadvisor that the Manager of 'Hotel Regina' personally answers every review, and from looking at the hotel website decided to get into contact. All my questions were answered quickly and efficiently, which left no doubt in my mind that I wanted to stay there. On arrival, everything that I had requested was in place and the room we had been given was truly excellent, with a balcony overlooking the square. The hotel itself is in a fantastic location, just a minutes walk from the top of La Ramblas and all it has to offer. Inside, the hotel feels very modern, with nice interior design and lightning, it's certainly impressive. But what really struck me was the service, nothing seemed like too much trouble, staff were always smiling and willing to help. Ontop of all this, on the morning we were set to leave (my Birthday), the staff sent a Birthday cake to our room - Such a touch of class and something that really made a great start of the day for me - Thank you so much to all involved! Next time I go to Barcelona I will definately be staying in the Hotel Regina, I have never before experienced such high quality service and surroundings.",
            "Great hotel located in the heart of Barcelona. Perfect location at one end of the Ramblas (Metro Catalunya). The service was great, the room was made ready and available before check-in time, breakfast was very nice. Truly a four star hotel (quality levels may vary among four-star hotels unfortunately). Free internet and print service in the lobby (in the other hotel, Royam Ramblas, we had to pay! ), nice bar also in the lobby. Cleanliness scored four out of five as the carpet in the hall /corridor had a few spots, but the room was large and cosy (we had a standard double) and TV had a nice selection of international / EU channels (but also CNN). We also went for the Romantic package and for 20 EUR we got breakfast for two and a bottle of Cava, it was really worth it. Breakfast was downstairs in the breakfast room so we had a full bufet not just a limited eat-in version. Cava was served the night before in the room. The swimming pool was closed for repair, but hey, we had the sea! Overall an excellent impression and I really regret that we were not able to spend all of our stay there (previous booking in another hotel). I highly recommend Regina.",
            "From the moment I walked into this hotel I experienced excellent service. The check in process was quick and friendly with plenty of staff behind the desk. The room was of a good size and had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. One small negative was the sink, which was located in the room rather than the bathroom. The TV didn\u2019t work and when this was reported to the front desk it was remedied immediately. Drinks taken in the hotel bar are a pleasure, with friendly bar staff that can mix cocktails and long drinks with skill and a smile; nothing is too much for them. The hotel is located at the top of Las Ramblas and next to the main shopping district where all the top names have stores. I have stayed in some of the worlds top hotels and this will always sit in my top 5.",
            "My husband and I stayed at the Regina for three nights in November. We were on our way to Barcelona by car when we were robbed. When we arrived at the hotel we told the staff at the front desk what happened and they were immediately helpful. They found the phone number and directions to the Canadian consulate and also walked us to the police station so that we could report the incident. They also upgraded us to a suite at no extra charge. Our room was very clean and big. The location was excellent right next to Placa Catalunia. Plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. The hotel also has a great bar and a bartender that makes a mean martini.",
            "This hotel can probably go both ways depending on the person. For me, I appreciated the 1916 era architecture right away at least. The location is quite good for access to La Rambla and the old castle part of the town, about a 15 minute walk down to the seaside. The only negative aspect that I encountered was the 'thinness' of the walls, on the first day I was there I noticed I could here every source of music and loud conversation on the floor (1st floor). Luckily, any noise that did seep into the room was completely cancelled out by the unbelievably comfortable bed and bedding... I was pretty shocked by it at first, as I did not think a hotel bed would ever qualify that highly for such a price (I've stayed in a LOT of king beds at hotels all over the place and they so far have never been exceptionally mentionable). I was also suspicious that the comfort was proportional only to my exhaustion, but this proved to be unrelated during the three nights I spent there. So yes, nobody should go to Barcelona to hang out in hotel rooms anyways, so if you need a place to stay that is mid-range, I highly recommend the Regina!"

            "We enjoyed a two night break (primarily to watch the rugby!) and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was delightful and the staff couldn't really do enough for us. My wife wasn't well during our stay so we had room service for breakfast - superb. The \"Grill\" restaurant does need to improve it's menu - the hotel suffers from having a top of the range restaurant (very dear) and the \"Grill\" restaurant which only really serves basic snacks. The hotel could do with a mid-range restaurant serving pasta, steak etc to be a complete package. The walk through the park to the Spanish Steps is lovely (though not advised at night) - taxi's to and from are not too dear however. We enjoyed being a little way from the hustle of the city centre. Overall a really beautiful hotel - recommended.",
            "We enjoyed very much the hotel nice swimming pool to relax after or before discovering Rome delicious breakfast and friendly concierge we were upgraded and the room we stayed in had been completely refurbished and was very comfortable the hotel is a bit far from the city centre but they have a shuttle or you take the cab not expensive around 10 euros and to my knowledge it is the only LHW in Rome which has a swimming pool",
            "We stayed at the Aldrovandi Palace in May 2008 for the second time - the first time was in July 2005. Since our last visit there has been significant refurbishment and the results are fantastic! The reason for choosing the hotel again was to have a pool to relax by when we weren't sight-seeing. The pool area is lovely and the hotel provide enormous yellow towels and extremely comfortable loungers to use while sunbathing. The only downside of the pool area is that there are so many trees surrounding it you end up dodging the shade all day if you want to get a tan. There is a lot of sun though - you just need to move every now and then to stay in it. Our room was huge and had a big mirrored wall on one side which made it feel even bigger. The bathroom was enormous and we both loved it - there was a huge separate walk-in shower with a rain shower head and the whole bathroom was spotless. The hotel is expensive for \"extras\" - for example a 75cl bottle of water by the pool costs 6 Euros, and buffet breakfast is 33 Euros per person, but it is a 5 star hotel and the prices are no more extortionate than other similar hotels. We booked through Expedia and got a really good rate and then we minimised what we spent while we were there. It's easy enough to get water and breakfast outside of the hotel if you want to keep your costs down. Overall I would definitely recommend the hotel. It isn't cheap but it has an air of luxury about it and you get really well looked after. It's also in a nice quiet area of Rome which means you feel as though you are coming back to an oasis when you return from your sight-seeing each day.",
            "Fortunate to have 3 nights on a business trip at Aldrovandi Palace. Rooms are better than average for Italy (I know it's 5 stars but anyone having been to Italy will know what I mean!) - a deserved member of the Leading Hotels of The World! Beautiful courtyard and great service. Villa Borghese is wonderful and, whilst not in the heart of the city, the hotel provides a free shuttle to the Spanish Steps for convenient walking (v close to Trevi Fountain & then 10-15min walk to the Colloseum). Not that I paid but wouldn't be cheap but would recommend for that 'special' weekend! !",
            "I stated here recently for 2 nights for a weekend break in Rome with my wife. The Hotel is quite lovely inside and the suite we had was spacious, luxurious and everything you would want from a 5 star hotel. Staff were efficient but lacked any kind of friendliness, which you sometime get in upmarket hotels. The hotel is located on the far side of the Borghese gardens from the main centre of Rome i.e. the Corso, Spanish steps etc and is therefore a 25 minute walk through parkland to the crowds and site seeing areas. The walk is quite pleasant through the park but we were recommended not to do it at night. The hotel has a shuttle bus service but we didn't use this so I can't comment on it. The only questionable element to the hotel are the dining facilities. They have 2 options, the first is a Michelin star restaurant called \"Baby\", which looked very nice but only had a set menu when we were there that was 180 Euros per person. The other option was something called the \"Grill\" but it did not in fact grill anything other than sandwiches, in other words it was a fancy snack bar. Cost is a relative thing but 180 Euros per person is too pricey for us, so got a taxi into town but it might be acceptable to others, so make your own mind up. Overall a really nice place, would I return, probably not just due to the hassle of having to get taxis everywhere after dark.",
            "This was our second stay in Rome and at the Aldrovandi Palace. We fell in love with Rome in August and decided to return to this wonderfully friendly hotel for New Year. The only disappointment was that the pool was closed and the outside bar area was deserted. A couple of patio heater would have been ideal for sitting out in the evening. We spent New Years Eve at the conciege's suggestion at Harry's Bar and had a wonderful and expensive evening there seeing in 2007. Fantastic!!! The hotel is fab and the conciege knowledgable and helpful, making suggestions for day trips and fab restaurants. I cannot recoomed the hotel highly enough. as a base for Rome. Yes the rooms may be small, however with all of Rome a 5 minute taxi ride away, you'll spend little time in it. The best venue for dinner in Rome is the rooftop restaurant at the Hashe view of Rome and the amazing cuisine. It'll cost you a months mortgage but you'll never forget the view of Rome at dusk and the foods fabulous. I threw a few extra euros into the Trevi fountain to make sure we return to Rome soon and when we do we'll stay at the Aldrovandi Palace.",
            "the hotel itself is really a luxury hotel but there were too many things that were unacceptable: I booked a deluxe room on a high floor with pool view but got a superior room on the first floor with view on the car parking area, the TV in my room although branded Bang and Olufson did not work, the yogurt offered at the breakfast buffet was expired....",
            "This was our third trip to Rome but our first with the children and our first to this hotel - but it won't be our last. Can't praise it highly enough, the staff were great - very polite and helpful and the rooms - although not overly large were well decorated and very very clean. We included the breakfast cost when booking the trip and were expecting a small continental affair, but the choice was good and included cooked aswell. The pool area, though not huge was very clean and felt suprisingly secluded, with pool attendants always on hand to provide you with a row of sunbeds should you need them. The hotel is in a good position just across the road from the borghese gardens which are nice to walk through to get to the main attractions although the hotel shuttle offered a fast and friendly service to the centre of things should you need it (booking with the concierge the previous evening is recommended if you require a morning service). All in all we had a fabulous time and will definitely return to Rome and the Aldrovandi.",
            "In making my travel plans...I discovered I was going to be \"forced\" to spend 4 days in Rome....... my first though was uggg Rome in August ... (I had been here a few times before staying in a private residence). So with the help of TripAdvisor I set out to find a hotel. As I had just spent a week in the mountains, 10 days by the sea I was not going to end this holiday on an unhappy note ..... the criteria for my search was .... somewhere off the park, and a swimming pool....... the result was the Alrovandi Villa Borghese .... Thank you TripAdvisor ...what a wonder experience........ the location was great ... it is either a 15 minute walk through a beautiful park or a short (free) van ride to the Spanish Stairs... the Staff was wonderful ........... Professional, helpful and even good for some laughs. My room was clean and happy and I slept very well.....and normally I am a poor sleeper. The breakfast buffet was an endless table of food ..... everything from scrambled eggs to Mozzarella, tomato and basil. The Pool and surrounding were the perfect siesta to wandering the street of Rome in the morning. I did not eat at the hotel famed restaurant Baby ...but I did eat in the Grill Room ....the food was excellent...but the menu lacked imagination ... This is a hotel for people who enjoy what is offered, so if you are on a budget, worried about money or who enjoy their holidays find faults.... you are best to go elsewhere I did lie in my title...I have one regret...not staying here longer",
            "We were a little worried about previous reviews after we had booked the Aldrovandi, but there was no need to worry at all. The hotel was lovely with nice spacious rooms. The staff were excellent and very friendly. The breakfast buffet was fantastic, just what you needed for a long day ahead of sightseeing and walking. There was a courtesy car from the hotel to the centre every hour which was great. It does not matter that the hotel is out a few minutes from the centre as the courtesy car or indeed the lovely walk through the gardens to get to the centre was fine. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Rome.",
            "My husband and i just got back from a 2 week vacation in Italy. We were in Rome for three nights and stayed at the Aldrovandi. It could not have been better. The staff is warm, friendly, and always ready to help you. As an example of just how helpful and accommodating they were at one point I asked (I think his name might have been Mario, not certain) if he knew where they bought the tablecloths they use in the breakfast room. I loved them and had been looking for something like them for years. He came right out from behind the desk and asked me to show him which i meant. We went upstairs so he could get a look. Then he recommended two places in Rome to try. They helped us numerous times with dinner plans, directions, really anything! Hotel Aldrovandi seems a little out of the way in that there is not much to walk to around them. The shuttle to the Spanish Steps made all the difference. They run every half hour until 10pm in both directions. I also loved the rooms. They were beautiful, clean, elegant, and the bed is comfortable which i am a stickler about. We absolutely have no complaints and only praise for this hotel and would absolutely stay there again! As an aside, make sure to check out the Borghese Gallery which is close by when you are there, you'll need reservations.",
            "this 5 star hotel was rather disappointing. The pictures of the website suggest something spectacular but the reality is a bit different. location is very good, near villa borghese, and the hotel still has a \"grand\" image but there are sign of tiredness all around. My \"superior\" room (ie the more basic category) was rather small and not particularly pleasant. Actually it even had two problems: the window did not open and the toilet flush did not work properly ,so that you had to fiddle with the control to make it stop. At > 300Euro per night I think one could find something better, even in Rome when often hotel room prices verge on the absurd",
            "We-wife and I-arrived in Rome late April and checked in to hotel near Spanish Steps. Unfortunately the temp in Rome was about 85 degrees F and air conditioning which had been stated as feature in website was not available until May 1.We did not feel we could sleep well on street fron with windows ope to street nois and had been flying for many hours, so called and visited the Aldrovandi where I had a reservation for 4 days later. They offered to take us that night or the next; a/c was working. We returned to first hotel and tried to get them to release us but had to pay 2 nights stay or not, so we stayed that night and moved to other next day. Aldrovandi is a great hotel with all facilities in a residential part of Rome next to Borghese Park. They have free shuttle service to the Sp. Steps each hour. Lovely outdoor pool, garden and courtyard. Breakfast was best we had in 3 weeks in Europe. Staff wonderful and had upgraded suite that was gorgeous. Was a pleasure to stay there 4 nights.",
            "A classy hotel with all the trappings to befit the 5 star \u2018Leading Hotels of the World\u2019 tag. It also has prices to match though we managed to get a very good deal by booking through Alitalia. That said, breakfast (described as a \u2018light buffet\u2019) is on top of the room rate and is a deterrent \u20ac33 per person per day. There are no nearby shops or restaurants (the hotel's own is in the very top bracket both for prices and quality), but the hotel, which is at the north end of the Villa Borghese park, is not that far from the central parts of the city, and the hotel runs a free, reliable and efficient shuttle service every half hour in each direction to and from the Spanish Steps (the same journey is about \u20ac7 by taxi). This only holds 8, however, so needs to be booked ahead, and the first one into town is 10.00 a.m. Unusually for a hotel in the city the hotel has an excellent pool (though this is so well shaded it is actually surprisingly cool). Service is impeccable and very professional. The rooms are spacious, handsomely appointed, and with all you would expect at this level. We were surprised that throughout our stay we had problems with the water \u2013 we had to run it for about 10 minutes to get hot water, and most days it was either very discoloured or speckled with bits. A top class hotel, though with very high prices unless you can get a good deal, and if you want a pool without being a long way out, this is highly recommended.",
            "We've just had 3 nights in this fantastic Rome hotel. The hotel is expensive but we decided to treat ourselves and by booking and paying well in advance with the Leading Hotels of the World Group we got rooms at a fraction of the rack rate. And the hotel is beatiful - very classy but not pretentious, great staff and service, great rooms and a lovely garden with a delightful swimming pool. The hotel is a liittle out of the centre which made it feel much more relaxed and a great place to return to after a hot day's sight-seeing. The hotel provides an excellent shuttle service to and from the Spanish Steps. We were on a room rate which included breakfasts which we really enjoyed - good choice and top quality. Bar drinks and room service etc was extremely expensive so we avoided buying anything extra in the hotel. The restaurant looked wonderful but the prices were very high. We might have treated ourselves had we not been with the children. However the hotel recommended a nearby restaurant which proved to be perfect - the Pagaroma. This hotel is expensive and at the top of the range but it is wonderful and made our stay in Rome an absolute delight.",
            "Mario the concierge was incredibly helpful. The breakfast very morning was delicious . The shuttle to the spanish steps was so easy, not crowded, we never waited. The room was elegant, clean, and we loved the Molton Brown bath products. I can't wait to return, I was so pleasantly welcomed during my 4 night stay at the Aldrovandi,",
            "We stayed there with my boyfriend for 2 nights, but even in such short period this place impressed us really a lot. First of all it has perfect location - just in the heart of Villa Borghese - in a peaceful zone, but very close to the center, just 10 min walking and you are in Piazza Spagna. The room was VERY spacious, perfectly equipped, clean, with new furniture and modern technics. We had both shower and bath, that is really comfortable. Breakfast was also included to the price and I can say that is one on the most rich breakfast I've ever seen - all food was really fresh, especially pastry and of course noone can re,ain hungry after such breakfast. For the guests of the hotel there was provided a shuttle bus that takes you every 30 min to the city center and then in evening brings you back. Probably the only thing that I would change in that hotel - is the Internet - it has a supplementary fee, but at the same time for Rome this thing is more than normal.",
            "Early autumn short trip to one of the great cities. 5 star elegance here that some might find 'traditional' in style - but that I liked, as it had not succumbed to a 'contemporary' makeover. Quality finishes throughout. The main plus point of Aldrovandi Villa Borghese, in it's park setting 5 minutes Cab ride from The Spanish Steps, is it's staff. The people there are first rate and service exemplary. Reception, through to room maids: all deserve a mention. Breakfast is absolutely civilised - and the room elegant & very well run; a fine start to the day. A final thanks to Oliver Glowig and his team in the restaurant - fine dining par-excellence. A special occasion meal certainly, but gourmands should note - very good cooking here!",
            "On arrival the hotel was stunning with a very friendly welcome and thorough check-in. We were personally escorted to our room, provided with all the details about the hotel and left to enjoy an excellent stay. Staff were always very happy to help with any queries we had and spoke very good English. Diran (the Lobby barman) is a great guy and made lush cocktails - highly recommended! Room was lovely - deep bath, lots of complementary toiletries, mini-bar, good tv, nice lightling, very comfy bed! Breakfast was good - usual continental style plus scrambled eggs and bacon, cereals, fresh fruit and champagne! Breakfast room overlooked a gorgeous looking swimming pool and garden terrace. Hotel was about a 25min walk (or 5 min courtesy mini-bus) away from Piazza de Spagna. We used the mini-bus throughout our stay as it was raining most of the time, which saved us a lot of money in taxi fares. Chauffeurs were always friendly and helpful. We had an absolutely fantastic time during our visit to Rome and the Aldrovandi Hotel was the cherry on the cake - superb!",
            "This is a well laid out hotel in a nice setting on the edge of Borghese park. The main plus point is the helpfulness of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms, the place itself is elegant looking but a bit tired now. We stayed in Feb on a 60% discount but it was still \u00a3160 a night. There were only news channels in English. There were no refreshment facilities in the rooms. The mini bar (I accept most are expensive) was outrageous 10 euros for a packet of crisps and 15 euros for a half bottle of beer etc. Whilst there is a shuttle every half hour to the spanish steps this is no good if you want to go north of the City, basically everywhere is a taxi ride. Albeit the main restuarant was closed the grill bar was rubbish, 40 euros for 2 pieces of scrawny chicken and saute ptoatoes. Wi-fi should be free but is was 9 euros a day with a download limit.",
            "My wife (Nicole) and I stayed at the Aldrovandi at the end of summer and I've been meaning to post a review since. Fantastic hotel. Close to the centre. Beautiful setting. AMAZING FOOD. All round first class experience. I'm usually very picky about service, but I must say - it was exceptional. Very impressed. We'll definitely return to this hotel for both pleasure and business trips in the future. Highly recommended.",
            "Elegant, special, a benchmark for when I am looking for something a bit more luxurious. The rooms were spacious, bathroom somewhere you wanted to stay ad soak for hours. Fantastic Michelin star restaurant excellent bar staff and a lovely pool ad seating area. Pool could be a bit cold so let's say if you're looking for a refreshing dip in a plunge pool this wil be it!! A bus that takes you into the centre and brings you back, means if you are tired or laden down with designer bags there is no need for the lovely walk through the famous Borghese parc and it's gardens. Choose a pool or garden view room as the ones facing the road can be a bit noisy especially if the open air club is on! Loved it and look forward to bringing him who is not so romantic with me one day to share my experience!",
            "We stayed here for 5 nights and it was incredible. The room was lovely, although not much space was left after they crammed in an enormous bed. The bathroom was gorgeous with an awesome shower + lovely Molton Brown goodies. Overall, the hotel was quite formal, but still relaxing. The concierge was brilliant - every recommendation or booking was a good one. The pool area was nice, but in shade for a large portion of the day; however, the pool restaurant was lovely. Breakfast was spot on; however, the 'grill' restaurant (not the Michelin star one) was really, really poor - it felt like we were eating in someone's hall. Finally, as you would expect, mini-bar or room service charges were astronomical. Still, I would definitely return one day.",
            "This is indeed a gracious hotel in a lovely setting albeit outside the city core, but in fact within a short taxi ride to most locations. If reserved in advance, you can always get their shuttle service to Via Veneto or the Spanish Steps. The refreshingly quiet loacation and their wonderful oasis, a sumptuous garden with a large pool, make this hotel unique and definitely worth it during Rome's hot summer days. The staff was 100% efficient and helpful. The breakfast buffet was ample. But the rooms, pretty as they were, are difficult to navigate with two people in the bedroom trying to move around. For us, this small inconvenience was outweighed by the other factors. RG Canada",
            "Booked this place as it is one of the few hotels in Rome in our price range that had an outdoor swimming pool as along with sight seeing we wanted some R & R in the sun. Unless you seeking a hotel with a pool I would recommend you stay elsewhere. There is no way the rooms are 5 star , more like 3* we cabbed it everywhere as one walks so much in Rome seeing the sights that the extra 20 min across the park did not seem appealing. The staff were all very good service was 5* and the setting 5* but the rooms are NOT and you will be dissapointed.",
            "First of all, I disagree with many of the things the dubai reviewer said about this hotel. It sounds like this reviewer has never been to places like New York City, where smallish rooms are the norm. We thought the hotel was very beautiful and our rooms were lovely. It is definitely worth it to ask for a room facing the pool/courtyard as the main road is right at the front of the hotel. It is a very expensive, old-school elegance hotel - much like the Del Coronado in California (which also has very small rooms, BTW). If you stay at a place like this, you can expect to pay a lot for everything. While we weren't exactly charging up the pool drinks and room service because of this, we still really enjoyed the beauty and elegance of the hotel. We thought the staff was very friendly, especially the doormen. The front desk staff is a little more reserved but also very helpful. The location of this hotel is the biggest downside - you can't really walk anywhere from here. If you need to find a store, take a left from the front entrance and follow the train tracks until you reach civilization - my husband and I found a great grocery store finally so we could have some snacks in our room one day. However, if I were you, I would pick up what you need before you return to the hotel. The shuttle is a nice amenity - you have to reserve your space so be prepared to take cabs if you can't get on one and are ready to go somewhere. I would recommend this hotel, but would not stay there again ONLY because of the location. It would be more fun to be on the Via Venetta or other place within close walking of Spanish steps or at least a subway stop.",
            "We, a family of four, stayed at the Palace at the end of August to mark a significant birthday. A junior suite and a twin room were booked and were ready for us on arrival and next door to each other as requested. The rooms were ok despite the fact that they were on the road side of the hotel rather than the garden and were low down. But we didn't come to Rome to spend time in the rooms! A bottle of champagne and bowl of fruit in the suite were a nice touch. The noise wasn't too bad at all. But we do live in a city. As everyone agrees, the pool is great. Unbeatable to have this in the city during the summer. The pool attendants were very helpful indeed. The Concierge function was excellent. Could not have been more helpful. They recommended and booked local restaurants and the Villa Borghese and were friendly with it. I wonder if there is something about treating them with respect and friendliness? Similarly the reception staff were efficient and helpful. I did note that when a few guests acted in a superior manner the atmosphere got a little frosty. The shuttle service to the Spanish Steps is great although the walk through the park is lovely. The lift back up the hill is appreciated however. Don't forget to book it at reception in advance as it is popular. The only negative point was that the hotel restaurant 'Baby' was closed for a private wedding party one evening. Not a major burden given the good restaurants near by, but hotel restaurants should be open for guests by definition. Also breakfast is ridiculously expensive. Instead take the shuttle to the Spanish Steps and have breakfast upstairs in the cafe opposite. It has a great view of all the comings and goings on the Steps. Not a cheap place to stay, but we concluded that it was worth the money and we would definitely stay there again.",
            "First class treatment all the way As we arrived early they let us check in and gave us details on the facilities and major sites of Rome Our room was given a complimentary upgrade and when we returned in the evening there was a complimentary bottle of wine All the staff went out of their way to be helpful and the service was top class in the restaurant As we were leaving for the airport late in the afternoon the hotel gave us a late checkout and provided changing facilities to enable us to use the pool area I stay in hotels quite a lot and although not cheap this hotel has excellent customer service and staff",
            "The reason that led me to choose the Aldrovandi Villa Borghese is the unique location. The hotel is located just in front of Villa Borghese so you don\u00b4t have any pollution or noise from the traffic. In order to reach the center you have to option : you can use the shuttle service which is offered complimentary and takes you directely to the Spanish Steps or you can take a 15 minutes walking through Villa Borghese Gardens. I got a wonderful Deluxe Room with a nice view over the park , the room size was quite huge with a stunning marble bathroom featuring a Mirror TV. Another plus of the room was the Minibar filled up with the most delicious snacks and beverages. It is very rare to find such an outstanding selection. I stayed 2 nights and I had enough time to soak up the sun in the beautiful garden with a nice swimming pool. From the swimming pool I had the chance to see the terrace of the gourmet restaurant Oliver Glowig so I\u00b4ve asked to the waiter to give me a menu and I found the menu very tempting with a resonable price. So I have booked a table for my mother and I for the same night and we got a real unique gourmet experience. The food was delicious, the atmosphere amazing and also the courtesy of the staff was a plus. I had the chance to meet the chef Oliver Glowig because apparently he greeds personally each guest that come to his restaurant. Very kind!! We had the chance to experience also the lavish buffet breakfast which has been served served in a very bright veranda overlooking the swimming pool. I have also to mention the courtesy of the Concierge that took great care of us recommending the best places to go in town. It was a real unique experience and I am looking forward to go back very soon next Spring! !",
            "A lovely hotel with a fabulous pool and 2 Michelen stars in the restaurant. The setting is unique and one of the best pools in Rome city. There's a shuttle bus every half hour to the Spanish steps so you're on via Condotti in minutes. The rooms are very luxurious and comfortable. The only negative - the breakfast room doesn't do this hotel any favours and is out of keeping with the rest of the hotel.",
            "We were greeted warmly on our arrival at the Aldrovandi on a steaming August afternoon. The charming Patrick escorted us to our lovely adjoining rooms on the third floor. Flinging open the shutters we encountered the most delightful view of the gardens and pool. Aware of the late hour and some of the comments I had read on Tripadvisor I enquired as to the possibility of a swim, and was delighted to hear that the pool is open 24 hrs, the only caveat being, there are no pool attendants after 7pm and so you need to take your own towel down with you if you wish to swim after that. Whilst the kids cooled off in the pool, which they had completely to themselves, we sat in the wonderful shaded gardens sipping chilled Pinot Grigio and nibbling on the complimentary pizzatinis. The surroundings really are exquisite, and exactly the situation in which you would like to find yourself, after a tiring day. The only problem we encountered during our stay was the difficulty in tearing ourselves away from this little Oasis to get down to the serious business of sightseeing! The complimentary shuttle bus was excellent, leaving every hour and dropping off at the foot of the Spanish Steps. They also pick up from here at 25 past the hour. I also thoroughly recommend strolling through the Villa Borghese gardens which is a lovely way to start the day and takes no longer than twenty minutes if you don't stop along the way. The concierge were absolutely first class throughout our stay,really helpful with information and restaurant reservations. Whilst there we celebrated our sons 18th birthday and on returning to our rooms that day they had supplied a beautifully presented tray of chilled champagne and petit four and a birthday card. The restaurant they recommended, Osteria d'Antiquaria, was superb and they even arranged a Birthday cake ! If you are planning a trip to Rome during the summer months I really can't recommend The Aldrovandi Palace highly enough.",
            "My husband and I ended a 3 week European holiday with a 5 day stay at the Aldrovandi. This hotel truly earns its five star rating. The building and decor are coolly elegant, modern yet richly Italian in design and \"feel\". Both the public spaces and the rooms were immaculately clean and well-maintained. They offer a wonderful turn down service in the evenings that makes you feel even more catered to. The breakfast buffet was simply amazing - abundant, varied and delicous food, beautifully presented and offered with gracious, attentive service. Speaking of service, I can't say enough about the staff - we Americans could learn alot from the studying the staff - at all levels - at this hotel. The concierge Mario was especially helpful, professional and just incredibly service-oriented. The shuttle service was great and being out of the wonderful but chaotic center of Rome was very relaxing as was staying in the midst of the beautiful Borghese Gardens. Also, we totally enjoyed the outdoor spaces, which were not at all for exclusive use of guests of Baby, contrary to another reviewer's comment, and we were able to use the shuttle service whenever we needed/wanted it.",
            "This hotel is old first of all, so are the rooms that feel like a three star or poor 4 star. We've paid the price as it was a top 5 star which made my dissapointment with the hotel bigger. Staff is...hm...ok, some of them. The great restaurant within the hotel did not work and we have had to use the hotel one. The waiters did not want to put 2 tables together for our group of 12 eve there was nobody else at the restaurant - they did not want to disturb other non visible guests???? We ended up (our comapny CEO and Regional Director actually) putting the tables together so we can sit. then they went out of wine we drunk, service oh my god not good. Not to forget that we have called once from the city to cancell dinner as we wanted to stay out and then we've changed our mind and called within next 5 minutes that we will not cancell. The receptionist or whoever picked up actually screamed at my colleague that this cannot be done and they've refuesed our dinner! Ended up in a great restaurant in the city afterwards which was even better then the lousy hotel restaurant. Everything we asked was a problem, but even if it was I do not see why to tell it in front of the guest???? It was witner so we did not try the pool although it looks nice. I did not notice a great location ecuase simply everything was far. I would NOT reccomend this hotel for the price they ask for and I would not go bac there if I was in Rome.",
            "I stayed for 2 nights at Aldrovandi Palace in November and loved the refurbishment. The Lobby is gorgeous and the rooms are fantastic, they even have TVs in the bathrooms. Regarding the location, it is a very quiet place and just a few minutes with the transfer from the Spanish Steps. By the way, transfer is gently provided by the hotel every half hour which helps a lot. The restaurant is amazing, I had a wonderful dinner with a view of the beautiful garden the Hotel has. Breakfast was delicious, all the Hotel Staff definitely made our stay more enjoyable,everyone is very charismatic. I strongly recomend this Hotel and I will definitely stay there again during my next trip to Rome!",
            "My partner and I stayed at the Aldrovandi Palace for 6 nights and I can honestly say it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It is a little out of the way however the hotel has a shuttle bus that takes you to the Spanish steps and picks you up. From there you can catch the metro to all the main sites which I would advise doing as taxi's are very expensive. There is also a tram stop outside the hotel which is handy. We booked a king size room however we were given a room with two single beds pushed together. We asked to be moved and we were straight away. They upgraded us to a superior room as they were fully booked. This room was lovely, it had a very big bathroom and massive bed and it even had a TV in the bathroom mirror. Some of the staff were a little abrupt at times but I think its just the way they are. The majority of them couldn't have been more helpful. I'm not one for name dropping but a guy named Alessio was especially helpful and genuinely interested in how we were spending our days. We had breakfast included which was good as the food and drink was VERY expensive (a bottle of water was 7 euros). It was very nice and the waiting staff were great. The coffee is EXCELLENT! The main thing that was good about this hotel was that it had a swimming pool, so of an afternoon after a long day of sightseeing it was nice to just chillout. They give you a cushion for the sunbeds and a towel which made it even more relaxing. All in all we had a fantstic time however bare in mind it is expensive. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a relaxing little hideaway in a touristy place.",
            "I spent a lovely romantic getaway at the Aldrovandi Villa Borghese. The atmosphere is very cosy and intimate. I experienced a silent and discrete elegance and luxury service. Enjoyed especially the garden with exotic plants and flowers, i ordered a glass of champagne rose surrounded in a magical atmosphere. This was the first perfect drink before dinner. I ate at the Oliver Glowig, the restaurant of the hotel, the food was delicious we stayed there till sooo late. Our room was on the third floor very quiet clean and comfortable",
            "The Aldrovandi Palace is luxury hotel abutting Villa Borghese. The service staff are friendly and helpful. While my husband attended business meetings, I toured the city, with much guidance from the concierge. The hourly shuttle to the Spanish Steps makes it easy to get to the heart of Rome and see all the sites you go to Rome to see. The magnificent Borghese Gallery is a short walk from the hotel. The room was lovely, comfortable and clean. The lobby bar is quite pleasant, as are its servers. Our meal at Baby was exquisite. The price for breakfast is admittedly steep, but that seems to be the norm at most top-notch hotels, including those in the United States. Taxis in Rome are expensive, but the shuttle helps allay that cost. Several in our group departed at the same early hour for the flight home so the hotel arranged for a mini-bus, which was there promptly at 6 a.m. and got us to the airport in plenty of time. All in all, staying at the Aldrovandi Palace made my husband's business trip seem less like work and made my Roman holiday very special.",
            "Very nice hotel ,frendly service-minded staff from the doorman,concierge,reception,bar,restaurant,breakfast-staff,houskeeping ,everybody is doing an exellent job.Nice big rooms,very nice bathrooms,lovely breakfast including sparkling wine!We could not try the Michelin star restaurant, we had our baby with us on the visit. Lovely pool area ,could not try too early not warm enough. Shuttle service to the Spanish steps every half our ,is a very nice service!! We will come back next time , to Aldrovandi ! !",
            "I do not generally comment on hotels, but this superb, newly refurbished - all in sparkly Italian marble hotel - inspired me to write a review! My teenage daughter and I have just returned from a five day stay at the Aldrovandi Palace . I booked after reading the various reviews on internet and I'm pleased to confirm that it was an excellent choice. One of the best aspect of the hotel is the service. From the doorman to the room service personnel, everyone was so friendly and professional. The service is personal and seamlessly attentive, the rooms are spotless and are experience worth. Giuseppe at concierge and his inside advices are impressed in my mind. Bedrooms offer supreme comfort, with stylish furniture. Advanced technology includes controlled air conditioning and Bang & Olufsen TV sets. The breakfast offered a fine selection of warm and cold food, fruit and a traditional Italian pastry. The breakfast room is absolutely gorgeous. Best restaurant in the city! The suits are not huge, but the garden and the swimming poll beats all in Rome . Free shuttle service, made my daughter happy, because it was vital for her frequent shopping excursions near Piazza di Spagna. Its palm garden and the Sorentino coast cuisine in the heart of Rome emphasises the holyday mood . It is within a walking distance of Villa Giulia, where my daughter and me enjoyed in of the most remarkable masterpieces of Etruscan art. Simply wonderful!",
            "Myself and my husband have just returned from a wonderful couple of days in Rome. We stayed at the Aldrovandi Palace Hotel. It was fantastic, it had a sense of old world grandeur. The staff were very welcoming and spoke excellent English. Our rate which we booked through Otel.com included breakfast and it was excellent. I would advise getting a taxi from the airport if there is more than one as its much quicker and works out roughly the same as a train and taxi. We took three Angel Tours. The First to the Vatican was fantastic we had an Irish guide called Anne Marie she was brillant. The second tour was the Heart of Rome, it was good but unfortunately the Pantheon was closed unexpectately so the tour was cut short. The Third tour we took was to the Colesseum and Roman Forum we were the only two people on the tour it was great - a private tour! I can't say enough for Angel Tours, take one you won't be disappointed.",
            "Absolutely pleasant stay! Walking across the park about 10 minutes is even better then staying in the very centre! The rooms are very cleen and stylish! More then that inside you'll find Bang@Olufsen TV system, wall-size mirrow, mirrow with TV(!) in the bathroom. Service is at it's best. Can definately recommend this hotel!",
            "The Aldrovandi Palace hotel has been the right choice: 4 days with my boyfriend to relax and discover Rome. Located in a chic area of Rome but still 10 min walking from Spanish Steps and the rest of the historical city center, the hotel offers even a shuttle service up to late hours to the center and back. The service was great, very kind and helpful personnel, the room was stunning with a great bathroom (TV in the mirror too!!). Moreover the hotel has a peaceful and chic swimming pool to relax, where a great garden bar serves fresh and tasteful lunches. On top of this, in the hotel you can dine at one of the best restaurants of the city \"Baby\", with Michelin starred chef Alfonso!! Great stay, hope to be back soon...the hotel was so good that it was really hard to get out and visit the city! !",
            "We returned from a week stay in Rome Italy.Our accommodations were at the Aldrovandi Palace. We were treated like king and queen. staff was amazing. Service was awesome, restaurant over the top awesomeChef Oliver Wolig meals were amazing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Rome.",
            "We stayed only 2 nights but managed to enjoy every aspect of this fine hotel. The staff was most helpful to our every request and made the four of us feel special. We particularly enjoyed the staff at the main floor restaurant and bar as they were very warm and engaging while being very professional as they served our food and drink. We think anyone wishing to be in the Villa Borghese local would do well to stay here.",
            "We arrived on the 14th of October and the driver took us to a very nice green area (Borghese Gardens) where the Aldrovandi is located (ten minutes walk from the Hotel to Piazza del Popolo and shuttle service all day long to Piazza Spagna). The Hotel is a Palazzo, we stayed in a very nice suite with views of the pool and gardens, classic style mixed with plasma and bang & olufsen music equipment (nice blend). Casual pool restaurant was good and the Baby (1 Michelin star) was beyond expectations in service, food quality, presentation and wines (10/10). During dinner we were introduce to the Chef Alfonso Iaccarino who also has a 3 Michelin Star Restaurant called Don Alfonso in Sant Agata (Amalfi). Concierge and reception were very reliable and can't tell you anything about the breakfast due that we just had cappuccinos in the room every morning. I recommend to go at least once to Mario in Via delle Vite, great food, service and ambience (lunch or dinner). Don't miss the Vatican museum but spend your money in getting a proper guide and be there at 7:30 am, you will be able to enter at 8:00 am and visit the Sistine Chapel with no more than 10 people (when we crossed it again at 11:00 to go to St. Peter's Basilic, there were more than 400 people easily). Ciao Italia, we will be back! Carlos and Natalia",
            "We stayed here for 5 nights and loved every instant. Fine blend of friendliness and hospitality professionalism. Everyone is alert and eager to provide you with a great vacation experience. This hotel is simply beautiful. Our room was elegant, airy and spacious. Marble bathroom is perfectly equipped. We were also lucky to experience the culinary delights of the 2 star Michelin rated Chef de Cuisine Gastronomique, Oliver Glowig. Food and service were absolute delight. Service was just impeccable, in every part of this magnificent marble hotel. Kudos! I am already booking another stay for April.",
            "Ihave tried for two week to get a reservation to take advantage of their special to a 4th night free. It would be less expensive going direct so I have not booked with expedia. I have tried for two weeks without a returned e-mail and none have come back. I want to stay here since I am traveling with my 11 year oild son and would like to take advantage of the pool.The e-mails have not been returned so it must be the staff that is ignoring the request. You can see when someone is online and they have chosen to neglect my inquiry.",
            "My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights recently in June 2011. We chose this hotel because we wanted luxury accommodation and an opportunity to relax at a pool. We were not disappointed at all. This is a wonderful hotel located on the outskirts of the tranquil Villa Borghese gardens. It is a short cab ride of a few minutes to any of the attractions in Rome. Staff were friendly and helpful and particularly Mario at the front desk Rooms are large and bright and the pool and gardens are a wonderful retreat after a day of hectic touring in the heat. The rooms and gardens are quiet and peaceful Food prices are way way up there so we did not eat in the restaurant although it is apparently one of the finest in Rome. Breakfast was included and was excellent. Would definitely stay here again particularly in the summer months.",
            "We've just returned from a wonderful four day break in Rome, staying at the Aldrovandi. If you\u2019re looking for the modern, ultra-hip five star experience there are plenty of options in this great city, the Exedra, the Aleph etc. But if you want the five-star European luxury hotel done like it used to be then you could so a lot worse than the Aldrovandi. When I\u2019ve stayed in Rome before it\u2019s always been in the city centre but one of the best things about this lovely hotel is the fact that you\u2019re about 4-5 minutes taxi ride from the tumult of Roma, on the outskirts of the Villa Borghese. The hotel runs an hourly shuttle to the Piazza del Spagna. But we either took taxis or enjoyed the 20 minute walk across the park- either to the Spanish Steps or to the Piazza del Popolo, enjoying the incredible views over the city before descending into the piazza. I can honestly say we couldn\u2019t fault the service at the Aldrovandi- from check in to check out. The concierges were unfailingly helpful, suggesting and reserving restaurants. Some of the other comments here about rude or difficult staff could not be more different from our experience. Our room was on the small size but incredibly comfortable (with a park view) and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was good- maybe a little lacking in variety but fine. I can\u2019t comment on the restaurant- Baby- as we ate out every night. One example of the Aldrovandi\u2019s service sums up why we enjoyed it so much. Our key was exactly that- a metal key on a heavy red tassel which we handed in every morning to the concierge, to be retrieved by him as he saw us come through the door, ready to hand over to us with a Buona Sera!",
            "I've stayed @ this hotel three times in the past several years. Initially, I overlooked the staff's condescending & pompous attitude but have finally decided that I've had enough! On my most recent visit, I made multiple requests for information about a nearby museum as well as the operating hours of a special exhibit at the Villa Borghese---all that I rec'd were excuses & empty promises that someone would provide me w/the information 'later today'---this continued for 3 days in a row! In addition, the hotel's 'complimentary' Van service to & from the Spanish Steps was extremely disappointing & frustrating: reservations are required for this service due to the limited number of seats available. The process actually turned into a fierce competition among the Guests--each of whom were vying for the small number available seats for each trip. On two occasions, we were forced to pay for a 'taxi' to take us to the Spanish Steps since the Van was full hours in advance...and the front desk refused to reimburse us for our expense! There are many other hotels in Rome that offer exceptional accommodations, are in more convenient locations, provide outstanding service & sincerely appreciate their clientele...I will no longer patronize a hotel where I am treated so poorly.",
            "I stayed at the Aldrovandi sadly for just one night. The way we were received was marvelous. We felt great, so much more after a very long flight. They were expecting us with beautiful rooms and a bottle of wine. It is situated in the middle of the park, surrounded by green lush. And quite near the piazza Spagna by a minivan that runs every half an hour from and to the hotel. Just a 5' trip. Very recomendable!",
            "Some months ago I was planning to make a romantic trip with my wife in Rome. A friend of mine suggested my wife to organize our second honeymoon at Aldrovandi Palace. I must say that he was right. Incredible hospitality, wonderfull service, lovely room, friendly staff, fantastic atmosphere......what else ! If you're looking for the best. Aldrovandi Palace is simply the best !",
            "I would like to thank all the management staff and the on duty team. I had a wonderfull experience at the Aldrovandi Palace, everybody so friendly and eager to help. The courtesy service provided to the spanish steps, turned out to be marvellus.After a full day of wonderfull sight seeing and shopping, the van took our bags back to the hotel, and we stayed to have dinner in the area.Speaking of dinner, our first night at the Aldrovandi we had dinner at BaBy restaurant, it was simply divine! Aldrovandi Palace is full of sun shine and charisma, beautiful decor, excellent service.A very happy customer from Brazil! Ciao.",
            "Wonderful hotel. As noted by others, the rooms are a little small. But they contain everything necessary for comfort. The staff do all they can to help, including calling our restaurant to say we were running late, finding vases and helping to trim flowers, offering to show us various rooms we might find comfortabe. The breakfast buffet is fantastic and set us up for the day. The free shuttle, every 15 minutes, to and from the Spanish Steps was a huge help. The only suggestion I would make is this: When we went the hotel was far from full and it seemed obvious that the better rooms on the higher floors were probably unoccupied. It would have been smart for the hotel to offer free upgrades to these rooms, as many hotels would have done.",
            "caught a shuttle from the airport for 35 Euro, looks good from the outside nice introduction and induction to sign in and shown ton room. this was below standard for a 5* room, we had to ask 3 times for pillows and 20min wait for ice. vanity kit was empty every day in the bathroom. no complimentary water in the room and no free wifi, but there is a free business center for 30mins. the bar man is very good but the hotel lacks stock, they don't have a lot or ingredients for drink and we asked for one that was on the menu and couldn't do it as well as a mojito. on a brighter note the food is amazing from BABY (1 Michelin star) as well as the grill. pool area is nice however not much privacy we did have to get our own sun bed mats and request towels, the guy seemed to only bring them over as an when he felt like. i was over charged as we left i will check this with them soon.",
            "A beautiful hotel with a classy lobby entrance. The hotel is away from the main city centre which is nice and its a short taxi ride away when needed. The staff were excellent, very helpful, friendly and polite. It cetainly made a bug difference to my stay and would be the reason why i would stay here when i visit rome again. Rooms are lovely, comfy beds and good amenities. Great place to stay and recommend this to business and leisure travellers.",
            "I am so happy to see that others have enjoyed the Aldrovandi as much as we always have. We have visited many hotels in Italy and always look forward to going back to the Aldrovandi. It has two great attractions for us, namely location and staff. The location supplies peace and quiet and enough space for gardens and a pool, yet handy for the centre. It might not appeal to anybody wanting to be plunged into the thick of thing in the Rome Centre, but for us it is marvelous to return to a warm welcome after a day of intensive shopping and sight-seeing. The hourly shuttle is a boon, & a taxi from the centre should be about 10 Euros (or a little more at night). The walk via the Borghese Gardens is only 20 mins or so, but I wouldn't recommend it after dark . The gardens/zoo also make for a lovely early morning walk if (like me) you are up an hour before your partner has finshed her \"toilettte\". Contrary to some earlier comments, we have always found the staff to be welcoming, cheery and very helpful. Whilst they retain a small degreee of formality as becomes a 5* hotel, they are still more friendly than any other hotel I have stayed at. Can't wait to go back!",
            "the hotel is well located next to Borgese Villa park, and 5-minute cab drive to the city center (Paizza del Spagna and Piazza del Popolo). The hotel has a free shuttle that leaves every 30 minutes, which is an excellent arrangement. i had two connecting rooms which are good for the family. Rooms are clean, traditional in style, cleaned well. Molton Brown toiletries. The staff is friendly and speaks English. You will find most of the TV channels at most world languages. Breakfasts are superb. One thing to look out for is air conditioning which is switched off in late autumn. make sure you ask for the room that faces the courtyard, otherwise you will find it noisy with having to open your windows.",
            "What we sought was simply a home base in Rome while we overcame jet lag and prepared for a two-week Italian auto tour. We were neither pleasantly surprised, nor disappointed, finding a moderately priced small room, professional staff and a delightful pool scene smack in the middle of Rome's Central Park West! The best and most expensive rooms are on the inside, facing the pool, while we stayed on the ground floor facing a busy street . But if you are going to splurge, do so at the new Lungarno Portrait Suites hotel, which we admired on a brief look-see. On the plus side, this hotel is directly across from the Borghese Gardens (which will prove a sublime treat to all who go there for a morning jog) and the short walk to the car rental outlet best situated for leaving this hectic city, the Borghese Gardens garage or the Parioli Hertz location on via Bruno Buozzi.",
            "All aspects of our stay at the Aldrovandi were excellent - from the elegant and spacious rooms, the helpful and accommodating staff to the delicious breakfast. The location on the Borghese Gardens means that the setting is peaceful yet still only a short drive from the centre of Rome - or a leisurely walk through the park. Well worth a return visit.",
            "My husband and I spent an enjoyable week at the Aldrovandi Villa in mid October. The hotel was very lovely, the staff gracious and our suite spacious. The room was cleaned thoroughly during the day and freshened in the evening. The bathroom was large with double sinks, Molton Brown toiletries and a fine bath/shower combination. All staff, including the front desk, concierge, bar, restaurant and the shuttle driver was accommodating. The hotel is by the Borghese gardens and museum and hence is in a quiet location.",
            "I selected this Hotel because of its proximity to the Galleria Borghese and the Galleria Nationale d'Arte Moderne e Contemporanea. On the plus side it is close to the wonderful, peaceful parklands. It is ,however, one of the noisiest hotels I have ever had the misfortune to stay in. Despite my requesting a quiet room some weeks in advance, when I arrived I was told there were none left. They offered to move me to a quieter room the next night. This did not happen. I spent three nights listening to continual traffic. When I complained I was told that they could do nothing! This Hotel should be honest about the noise levels. Unless you go to bed in a drunken stupour you will find this a noisy hotel. The rooms were obviously decorated 20 years ago and are in need of a make over. The showers are hand held and weak. Don't rely on the hairdryer, it would be quicker drying your hair out the window. The Hotel has a wonderful pool and outdoor area, away from the street. The food is expensive 16 Euros for a plate of broth! It has a strangely named restaurant called \" Baby\", which produces good food at a price and a grill room that offers expensive snacks/drinks. One can take a leisurely stroll through the wonderful parklands nearby to Via Veneto. There are some wonderful Restaurants off Via Veneto. I would recommend Papa Baccus Restorante in Via Toscania. Despite the interesting English spellings on the menu the food is excellent. This street is behind the Marriott. The Aldrovandi Palace is a a noisy faded beauty manned by bemused staff. Unless you like to sleep on the street, I would give this place a miss!",
            "We went to Rome, my husband and I last July 2010. We ended up at the Aldrovandi Villa Borghese which is a Leading Hotels of the World, at the beginning I was a bit concerned about my choice it was our anniversary and I really wanted to surprise my husband and make him feel better cause he is working a lot. I really did not expect all the attention they gave us during our stay. As soon as we entered in the room (very nice room, large with nice view and lots of natural light) we found a nice bottle of champagne with bon bons and a greeting from the director of the hotel. The all experience was very good I am defently going back for my birthday I am sure they won\u2019t miss it.",
            "Pros: Absolutely gorgeous, top-notch breakfast buffet (included in some packages), beautiful rooms, and service is the best we've ever enjoyed. Concierge Guiseppe is THE BEST- professional but warm, helpful in making complex arrangements to simple advice. All staff we encountered was warm, helpful and English-speaking. They knew it was our 20th anniversary, and champagned and desserts were waiting for us when we arrived as well as an upgraded room. Con: only one- not the most convenient location, as it is beyond the city walls to the north. You are near the Borghese Museum. Villa Borghese, and National Museum- and an easy walk to Via Veneto for excellent dining and shopping- but a long walk from many top sites. The hotel runs a free shuttle to Spanish Steps every 20 minutes, however, which really helps. Highly recommend the nightlife around Spanish steps and Trevi fountain- always buzzing with people and activity!",
            "The hotel is elegant and beautiful, apart from the awkward manekins that greet you in the lobby. The pool/garden area is lovely but you can't sit out during the evening unless you're eating at Baby restaurant and the inside lounge is rather gloomy. The food options are very limited if you're not eating at Baby. The alternative 'Grill' restaurant only serves snacks and salads and strangely nothing 'grilled'. Breakfast is very good but a bit chaotic. The shuttle bus service to the spanish steps would be handy if it wasn't booked up in advance for the times you're likely to want to use it. I enjoyed my stay overall but will rather stay somehwere else with outside space that you can hang out in in the evening and more relaxed dining options.",
            "Fabulous hotel! Great break from the hustle and bustle of Rome. Pool is long enough to swim laps in, and empties out around 6:30p before it closes. Gym is sufficient and empty for a quick work out. Room service and breakfast are way overpriced. Staff is attentive, especially housekeeping, concierge and valet. Concierge found great restaurants. Bathrooms are beautiful. Great place for children. Right across the street from the park with the zoo. Shuttle runs back and forth to Spanish Steps every 15 minutes. Get Bruno with the Eternal City tours and you will be set!",
            "Great expectations from the website, a booking for a garden view plus honeymooner status... poor quality shabby 1970s room that felt like it was stuck up in the attic, no view of garden or pool unless you craned your neck. Incomplete TV reception on an enormous vintage set, no wifi (had to go to outdated business centre and then asked to pay...which seems so tight given price of rooms) only mens magazines on side table, awful complimentary shampoo etc (not even conditioner)....in fact a no sense of luxury at all. We asked to swap rooms which they reluctantly did after an hour's wait - a junior suite instead, facing the road which was fine and more modern. Large empty lobby, no papers, no real local information (surprising given it's next to the most fabulous garden with Villa etc nearby), gym was really unappealing and out of date. The only great thing was the pool which was wonderful. We did not try Baby restaurant as it looked so empty! DIsappointing really, but thankfully Rome is brilliant.",
            "The location is very nice in a quiet corner of the villa borghese surrounded by embassies. The hotel was very nice. The rooms were small but air conditioned and more than comfortable. They tout their car service to the Spanish steps but service was erratic and often full. Breakfast good, not great. There was a beautiful pool but alas we were too busy touring",
            "An outdoor pool is a must in Rome when the temperature reaches nearly 40 degrees at this time of year. The Rooms are air conditioned and the breakfast is fantastic! A good all round hotel which is conveniently situated for the Centre. The only negatives I would give is the Service was a bit slow during the day for drinks etc The evening service in the \"Baby\" restaurant is totally different, it seemed totally seperate from the hotel. All the staff in the hotel were friendly and polite.",
            "We stayed four nights at the Aldrovandi Palace. The first inconvenience was that Booking had not sent our reservation to the hotel. Luckily, a room was available. The hotel was nice, the service very good, the shuttle to Piazza Spagna very convenient. The only regret was the price of the Internet connection: 22 euros per day. Of course you also had the opportunity to use it by hour at the price of 10 euros/hour!!! We will not stay again in a hotel that charged that much for Internet.",
            "Stayed here for business, had a wonderful spacious and comfortable room overlooking an elegant residential neighbourhood with embassies. free shuttle bus to Spanish steps every 30 minutes, it takes 5 minutes to get there. Great for joggers, the parc is just across the street. Large fitness center for rainy days. I loved the breakfast buffet with lots of fruit and different joghurts and home made pastries. Bed very comfy and Molton Brown amenities in the bathroom with maxi shower stall. Front desk staff very helpful and efficient, not so stuffy as in some of the old palaces in the centre. Will be back Rolf MB, Paris",
            "Excellent stay with very helpful staff. Request a room overlooking the garden / pool and facing the inside area. Ground floor might be a bit close to the road. Staff very helpful and an excellent Michelin star restaurant which is surprising good value (for Rome). Very pleasant stay and would definitely return. But its not cheap.....",
            "We booked this hotel as a way to reward ourselves at the end of our trip and it was worth every penny. It is among the most expensive places we have stayed at but it is worth every penny. Starting off the location is stunning. It is surrounded by beautiful gardens and is well away from the crowd. They have a shuttle that takes you right to the spanish steps so you spend nothing on taxis. We were lucky enough to be upgraded and the rooms are beautiful. They are white, with large bathrooms and a huge bed. There is a television in the bathroom thats embedded in the mirror. That in itself was worth the money! Food is fantastic and the hotel hosts one of the finest restaurants in Rome - Baby. The concierge desk does what its meant to and advises you on everything and books all your trips especially that all important visit to St Peter's Basilica. They also gave us fantastic recommendations for Dinner. This is our hotel for Rome and we will always go back here.",
            "I cannot fault this hotel, its a twenty minute walk through beutaiful gardens to the sapnsih steps and far enough away to escape the city by the pool. I never want internet acces when i`m away but can see how that is strange for some people BUT this is not a modern hotel so expect old class elegance. It was my and my new new husbands first visit to Rome and our honeymoon, and I have to say from the moment the car and driver met us at the airport our stay was magnificent. All the staff especially the delightful concierge where incredibly helpful and amazed me at even supply a bottle of champagne! We could not fault your hotel and especially the staff who I think make the hotel so special. We will definitely be recommending your hotel to anyone who will listen and we will definitely be coming again, maybe for our anniversary ! Many Thanks again for making our honeymoon. Sue Andrews (Mrs)",
            "We visited Rome for the first time and friends told us to look for a nice hotel as a bad hotel can spoil your trip to this beautiful city. As we expected the weather to be very hot we based our search for a hotel on an outdoor swimming pool. And the pool held what it promised, very refreshing surrounded by a beautiful garden. We booked a pool view room, which is essential as there is a tram passing the front of the hotel! The location is not perfect but the shuttle service is excellent. A taxi will cost you between 10 and 20 Euros from the centre of Rome. The service was excellent, and the hotel itself just beautiful. A little tip, by pure luck we got to a restaurant on top of one of the hills of Rome called \"The View\", not only fantastic food, but as it says in the name, the view over Rome was fantastic. That you have to try the hotel's own restaurant \"Baby\" goes without saying- oh Baby!",
            "fast, friendly service from checkin to checkout. Upgrades granted almost always with breakfast staff friendly and courteous. Never noisy. Have a cappuccino ! Villa Borghese right across the street and a 15 minute walk to the top of Via Veneto. Excellent value if you book a couple of weeks ahead.",
            "My husband and baby daughter stayed here in August and on 1st appearances the hotel was very grand and staff were extremely helpful. Our room was of an average hotel size but it was very dark and quite dingy. The bathroom again was small and of average standard. The TV only had one channel (BBC News24) in english and any childrens channels were 19E each. The pool area was lovely and a very relaxing place to be and the pool attendants and restuarant staff very attentive. There wasn't however enough space around the pool when the hotel was full and fighting for sunbeds actually in the sun became a daily battle. The pool was nice and clean but freezing. We chose this hotel because it had 2 restuarants to eat in and we would have to stay in most evenings because of our baby daughter (babysitting was an option but we only booked twice as it was 20E an hour). The mitchellin starred resturant was nice but very overpriced in my opinion and the 'grill' restuarant grilled nothing! All you could eat there was salads, even in the evening. The menues were very poor throughout the hotel and choice was very limited. Breakfast was disappointing again and again very overpriced at 20E a head. In summary the whole hotel was overpriced and very tired looking. Fantastic shuttle bus I wouldn't stay there again - unless they reduced their star rating and prices.",
            "The hotel is situated 5min walk of the national gallery and the villa borghese park. The hotel offers free rides from the hotel to the Spanish steps every 30min. from early in the morning and comming back( the last bus leaves at 10.45pm.) One thing, make shure that you reserve a seat for this bus because it is small. The pesonel is very friendly and helpful. The restaurant situated in the hotel is nice but expensive, a glass of chardonnay was suggested (25,- euro's per glass). The diner was nice but not sooo nice.. that ofcourse depends on everyones own taste. A glass of coca cola is 9,-. Capuchino 6,-.The beds in the room where hard and I prefer softer beds. The breakfast is very good! The pool and garden is fantastic.",
            "The Aldrovandi Palace Hotel owes this favorable review as much or more to the location and other amenites, as opposed to the hotel facility itself. Located in the \"green lung\" of Rome behind the Borghese Gardens, the location even in the heat of summer felt resort like and offered a relatively quiet environment. The hotel pool is cool and refreshing and the outdoor cafe is a wonderful place to have lunch. Sandro, the cafe manager, was one of the best hosts we have encountered on our travels throughout the world. Were the front desk as committed to customer service as much as Sandro is, the overall experience would have been superb, but it was not. We were, however, able to overcome our annoyance on arriving from New Jersey to find our room not ready though it had been requested. Also ignored was our request to have an upper level floor in the back and away from the sounds of streetcars in the front of the hotel. We were moved, but the request from our travel agent for an early check-in and back room had been totally ignored until our arrival. Based on the location, pool and outdoor cafe, we would return to the Aldrovandi Palace Hotel without a hesitation in summer time. We can't imagine a more pleasant environment in a big city at that time of year. We might consider other properties in non summer months, however, as the room itself was very ordinary, the front desk concierge service flawed (in its accuracy on certain tourist information and overall helpfulness) , and though we reported our tub/shower leaking on 3 occasions, it had not been fixed by the time we left and we were there for 3 days prior to going on to Sardinia. So any readers of this review would need to look at it from a seasonal perspective with a high rating given for a summer accomodation and a more questionable rating at other times of the year.",
            "We are regular traveller all round the world, but this hotel is really something special. To start with - it is located in real oasis in Rome - Villa Borghese, where you can escape from crowds and noises of this wonderful city. Air around the hotel is very fresh and clear. At the same time you are 5-10 minutes from everywhere of interest. Hotel has got excellent shuttle service to Spanish Steps. Front desk staff were unbelievably supportive, friendly and carefull to every your need. It was our first time in Rome and Concierges - Giuseppe and Mario - made our acquaintance with Rome very pleasant and efficient. Apart from this restaurants, beauty salons, they directed us to, were really fantastic. In Aldrovandi they have now their prominent restaurant with Michelin chief-cook. This made this hotel even more attractive to us. The barman made for us tailor-made cocktails with proportions which we prefered. Rooms are spacy and cousy and very clean. In summer there is open swimming pool in the hotel's garden. We could write more and more, but to cut this nice story short - I think Aldrovandi Villa Borgese is unique place, which concentrates in it only positive air, style and emotions. We can not wait we will be back! Jonathan Jones and Janna Kochkina",
            "Hotel very traditional and quiet. Most staff (especially restaurant) were extremely helpful and professional. Having booked a specific room not overlooking the road was somewhat disappointed to be allocated one during a three night break away from our three young children. First night spent wide awake with traffic noise and faulty air conditioner - to justify the room rates attention needs to be paid to the sound proofing of rooms. Consequently we moved room after first night (as did several other guests) which was an inconvenience we could have done without. During the move a soft cuddly toy was left behind between rooms which we realised on our way home - whilst it was not expensive it was for our seven year old daughter and I do not understand why Housekeeping did not find it as it was clearly new in a Harrods bag - on enquiring at the hotel it was apparent from the tone of the staff at that time that they did not really want to go into any great depth to find it. When asked if they would ask the Maid when Housekeeping came back negatively they were defensive. Not what I expect from a Leading Hotel of the World - we have stayed in many far more luxurious accommodations. Rome really needs a Four Seasons to knock service into the 22nd Century. No water at turndown time is really not acceptable in this day and age. Baggage taking an age to be located, arrogance from front desk. Overall a nice break but certainly not \"historic\".",
            "The stay was expensive and hotel rated high so I expected to get value for money. BUT, the hotel is very old fashioned and room needed a face lift. When we went to the room and put the air conditioning on, it made terrible smell to the room as it was not cleaned or used for a while. Room had a carpet floor, which created untidy impression. Quite busy street was right under our window which made the stay a bit noisy. Location is not the most convenient to see the major sights - on the other hand Borghese park right next to the hotel is good for jogging and relaxing. Breakfast was luxorious. I felt it was bad service that we did not get iron and ironboard to the room even though we requested but were forced to utilize the expensive ironing services from hotel. I'm type of person who wants to do it myself. All in all, maybe some old fashioned people like this hotel but not for me.",
            "We absolutely loved our stay at Aldrovandi Villa Borghese. The receptionist was lovely and helpful. The room (delux room) was spacious, luxurious and practical. The housekeeper tidied the room twice a day. A great and surprising touch with tv integrated in the mirror in the bathroom. Loved the Molton Brown toiletries. Breakfast had a nice and well-assorted selection. Nothing extravagant but all you need. Very friendly and attentive waiters. Outdoors pool was a perfect cool-down in the warm summer weather in Rome. Distance to Rome city centre is a 15 min walk through a lovely park. The shuttle service is also a practical and easy alternative. Just remember to book ahead for the last runs at night. Be also aware that prices in mini-bar and restaurant are very high. Bottle of water in minibar comes at 8 euros!",
            "Well apart from being quite a way out of town (a good 20 minute walk through the park), there were a number of little things that let the place down. we paid for a superior room ... and the first night, it certainly wasn't what we received (small room with barely enough room to move around the bed). With the trams rolling past all night, you want to make sure you get a room at the back. The last two nights were certainly a different cup of tea in terms of size space and quietness. But there were also a string of little things that annoy - from an Internet service that takes more trouble than it should to administer (quite slow too). To the lack of service or any sort of response on a Sunday morning by the pool. The breakfast was excellent, but only having the choice of an eye-watering expensive restaurant (but good), is not really good enough. There really is nothing around this hotel apart from the park opposite (nice) - but at least a 10-15 minute walk to find an espresso, and similarly in the other direction for the only restaurant in the neighbourhood. Otherwise you are into a shuttle to the Spanish Steps every half hour (often booked up). Overall, the decor was 1970's trying to be old ... just doesn't cut it any more. For the money, I would choose other options.",
            "For a reputable 5* Hotel in Rome, we were very dissapointed with this hotel. The rooms were poorly decorated, staff below average and overall service quite poor. It was one of five 5* hotels we stayed on our honeymoon. Honestly, we will never stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it to our friends.",
            "hotel staff are brilliant-couldn't fault them in particular Eva, most helpful. Our room was clean and the turn down service with chocolates lovely. Our breakfast were the main bone of contention, for a michelin star restaurant on the premises what happened in the morning? Had they employed a cleaner to whip up cold eggs, even colder cups of cappucino, and as for the rest of the \"hot food\"..... how they can get everything else so right beggars belief. The breakfast was like this everyday the only redeeming feature was the free paper, but how can youenjoy that when sipping tepid salty tea? Location ideal to get away from the hustleand bustle, and the free shuttle to town is very handy.",
            "The Aldrovandi is is beautiful luxury hotel in Rome. However my husband and I found the location somewhat out of the way. The walk through the Villa Borghese gardens were lovely in the mornings but the climb up the hill, through the gardens and up the hill to the hotel could get quite tiresome after a long day of sightseeing. However, the pool and garden areas were a wonderful retreat from the hustle and bustle of this magnificent city. I can truly say that I fell in love with the City of Rome. As did my husband. We have been fortunate to travel to a number of locations and this is one of a few we would truly love to go back too and spend more time. The history is amazing, the people friendly, the food and the wine, what can one say. We enjoy walking the environs of cities we visit and the main core of Rome (Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, Piazza de Popolo, Capitoline Hill, etc) are all delightful walks. Being an ancient city you often turn corners and discover something quite unexpected.",
            "We arrived in the hotel and greated with a cold smile . We were shown to our rooms through a smelly corridor Thankfully the room did not smell as bad. Rooms basic WARNING when taking a taxi to the airport BEWARE as our taxi arrived to the hotel with 9 euros on the meter and went into the hotel to get change I reminded him the meter was running and he said it will only be euro on the meter.He then handed the porter some money 1 or 2 \u20ac5 euro notes .We got to the airport the meter read \u20ac79.80 when it should be less then \u20ac55 as the hotel concierge advised.This would lead me to belive there is a scam going on in a hotel you would not expect . Daniel the shuttle bus driver is very helpful. A bottle of heiniken is \u20ac11 at the bar espresso \u20ac9",
            "From arriving at the hotel on Thursday last week, we were greeted by the most friendly, polite staff. We were given a brief guide to the hotel facilities, then shown to our room with a beautifull view of the pretty courtyard style gardens and pool area. The room was clean, bright and airy, and the bathroom clean, modern with bath and shower. The hotel is about a 10 minutes drive to the Spanish Steps, but the hotel provides a courtesy people carrier on the hour between 10am and 7pm then picks up at 25 past the hour - you need to pre-book this each day, but we were never refused. Our normal driver, Daniel, was a credit to the hotel as he answered every question, and even detoured one day to drop us closer to Vatican City. The hotel has a lovely lobby area with a bar which was comfortable, quiet and well serviced. Breakfast at 33 euros per head was overly expensive for what it was (especially as we only had a coffeee and a croissant) On the saturday night, which was my wife's 40th birthday, we dined at Baby. We have dined at many top restaurants in london, but nothing compared to our experience here. We opted for the taster menu, of 7 courses including scorpion fish, beef, pasta, wild mushrooms - I can not begin to describe the taste and quality. It was fairly expensive at about 180 euro's including a bottle of wine - but worth it - especially when the waiter brought out a birthday cake for my wife - totally unexpected!! The waiters were very attentive, and the decor very contemporary/minmalist. Overall, a fantastic experience that i would recommend to everyone - and one that my wife and i will not forget - thankyou.",
            "I stayed at this hotel on valantines weekend (fed 08) with my girlfriend. The hotel is very nice inside, and the staff are very pleasant/helpfull. The rooms are very tidy, and the complimenty turn down service at night leaves you with slippers next to your bed and chocalates. The hotel room is equipped with complimenty bathrobes, slippers, shompoo's etc, bowl of fruit, and a bottle of water. The bathromm is very big, huge bath, and lovely. Things to note: Whilst we stayed there, there are renovation works in the lobby, this is not noisy at all, and you will harley notice it. The hotel is very expensive inside, the resturant Babys is 300Euro per head, so i would not eat in the hotel. The hotel provide a free taxi to the spanish steps (central location) on every hour 10am-7pm mon-sat. This is great. The hotel is not right in the centre and it is 7euro into the centre of rome, 10euro to the vatican. I would reccomend you use the shuttle bus, they drop you off an dpick you up at 25past each hour. One in the city, you must walk rome, as you get to see a lot more. The hotel will provide you with a map. As for noise, the renovations are very quiet. We stayed in a room next to the road, and it was not noisy at all. Last thing, bring a travel iron, the hotel room will not provide you with an iron, they charge 15euro for an ironing service, and you must give the item in bye 10am that day. Overall, the hotel is lovely and i would reccoment it to everyone. The bad reviews must be very moany people, as the hotel is wonderful. Thanks",
            "We visited Rome over the New Year\u2019s Holiday to celebrate the arrival of 2012 in the Eternal City. We were extremely pleased with our stay at this hotel. The location inside Villa Borghese added to the magic of the location and was breathtaking. Upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted by beautifully decorated and manicured trees sparkling with white lights and red d\u00e9cor. Inside we were greeted by a lovely young woman that assisted with our check in and then escorted us to our room. She provided an informative tour along the way. We found the lobby bar to be attentive and offered a vast selection. Aside from some Wi-Fi issues at the front desk, we had a most pleasant stay. Wi-Fi in the guests rooms worked without issues. The hotel does provide a van to the Spanish Steps which also provides access to Rome\u2019s most fashionable shopping. Following our visit, we talked with management about one concern and it was rectified immediately. I can\u2019t say enough wonderful things about the magnificence of this hotel. We travel all over the world and will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and can\u2019t wait to return in the near future.",
            "Lovely building with classic decoration, a lot of wood panelling and an elegant atmosphere that reminded me of the Quisisana on Capri. The hotel smells of amber, like the Plaza Athenee in Paris, another of my favourites. The rooms are comfortable but a little dated, especially some of the bathrooms. The attention to detail, especially the housekeeping, is among the best I have ever seen (reminded me of the Ritz in London). Great bar and very good grill restaurant in a room next to the bar decorated like a traditional English club. Breakfast is served in the gorgeous Sala Verde with a veranda overlooking the garden. The buffet is well presented but is fairly standard and not at all up to the level of the Michelin-starred restaurant. Lovely garden with pool and terrace cafe. Large fitness room but some of the Technogym equipment is out of date. Great service from all the staff, but a special mention for the waiting staff at the bar and the grill restaurant. The location is good if you want to be away from the crowds of central Rome in the summer. It is across the street from the Borghese Gardens and close to the Villa Giulia and a few other museums. The hotel has a shuttle to the Spanish Steps, but I would hesitate to use the Aldrovandi as a base for a first trip to Rome.",
            "The Aldrovandi Palace is located across the street form the Borghese gardens. The beautiful neighborhood is full of fantastic villas. This is a great place to retreat to after a day of heavy sightseeing. The pool and gardens are wonderful. Try to get a room overseeing them. Although some reviews complained about expensive wi-fi, I was given 24 hours free and offered free use of an I Pad for 2 hours at a time, so there is no need to pay for wi fi. Most plans include breakfast. The restaurant on site (Oliver Glower) is excellent from a chef with 2 Michelin stars at his place in Capri. Transportation into the heart of the city is easy: walk a half mile to either the Flaminia or Espana metro stops, take the hotel shuttle, or it is an inexpensive cab ride. The staff could not have been more helpful. Highly recommend.",
            "The hotel is close by the Villa Borghese park, and has a shuttle car every 30 min that l bring you to the Spanish steps. This is also the pick up point when going back to the hotel. The rooms are spacious. We ordered an airport transfer from the hotel which was charged with 100 euros. The taxi back to the airport came on 50 euros. This combination suited us best. We received an upgrade on the room, which was spacious and delicate. The staff were very helpful and knowledgable. The breakfast was ok. Had however expected more from this hotel - no vegetables, and the musli was crumbled cookies, but the breakfast room was beautiful. Walking distance to the Museum of Modern Art and the Villa Borghese museum. If you like jogging, bring your gear, because the park is perfect for that. Perfect hotel in Rome, and would definitely come back.",
            "What a find this hotel was. Whilst quite expensive it was worth every penny, the staff were excellent and the concierge was especially helpful. Our friend\u2019s room was not quite as modern as ours but still good. The pool area was absolutely super which we used late afternoon having spent most of the day exploring Rome. The courtesy car to the Spanish Steps was also good and was quite prepared to drop you at points on the way to the Steps.",
            "We absolutely adored this grand hotel and particularly its key location, ideal for those who appreciate and love to enjoy the hectic rhythms of the \u2018eternal city\u2019 but at the same time love to have the privilege of a special retreat where privacy is guaranteed. Just few steps from Villa Borghese gardens this hotel offers the unique opportunity to enjoy jogging or simply a walk down to the Spanish Steps\u2026where the complimentary hotel shuttle bus is ready for you to even pick you up at the end of a tiring shopping day take you back to the hotel: how fabulous! Spacious and elegant rooms and professional staff complete this magnificent frame!",
            "We stayed at the Aldrovandi Palace to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary and it was simply perfect. The hotel is spotless. the rooms are spacious and beautifully maintained. It was fantastic having a swimming pool after a hot day sightseeing and the service around this area was first class. The shuttle service to the Spanish steps was reliable and it was a pleasure to eat out each evening under the moonlight. All the staff were friendly, professional and efficient. We are planning our next trip already.",
            "This is a lovely hotel about 25 minute walk to the Spanish steps. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Gorgeous bathroom although I felt the decor was slightly dated in the room. Lovely breakfast (continental and cooked) but it's a bit expensive if not included in the price - 33 euros! Drinks were also a little pricey in the lounge bar, 9 euros for a small beer. One small quibble, we asked for an iron and were told laundry could only be sent away, it cost 20 euros to have a dress pressed, so pack your travel iron! Very nice pool area with attentive service. A lovely stay in Rome away from the hustle and bustle.",
            "We booked a weekend in Rome in April and decided to push the boat out and book a room at the Aldovandi Palace having been so taken in by their website. Be warned, if you book a standard room do not be fooled by the photos and expect a similar standard. The room we were given was on the ground floor, was tiny, tired and had a very 70s looking mirrored wall. We both felt very upset and so I went straight back to the reception and spoke to the manager. To their credit they immediately showed me a deluxe room and upgraded us free of charge. This room was a little more like the sumptuous settings as portrayed on their website. The air conditioning, however, did not work and so we slept with the window open all night which kept us largely awake with the constant trafic and trams. On a plus, the breakfasts were the best we have ever had in a hotel. The choice was enormous and very delicious. This hotel Im sure was once one of the leading small hotels of the world. However, it now has a very dated and tired feel throughout and probably not worth the rates they charge.",
            "Overall i thought the hotel was excellent.The staff were very professional.The only downside was the bed.It was rock hard,as was my brother in laws bed. We were told that they were all like it. Also, the only way of cooling the room was to keep the window open as the Air Con was turned off at this time of year. This resulted in a dozen or so insect bites. My family had not told the Hotel that it was my birthday, but i did arrive in my room that evening to find a bottle of Sparkling on ice. A very nice touch. All in all it was a very nice experience. just a shame about the bed and the temperature."

            "I just came back from Rome after spending 4 nights in Cicerone. I would say this hotel deserves maybe 3 and a half or almost 4 stars. Location is just excellent - walking distance to Trinita dei Monti, Piaza Navona, Trastevere, Campo do Fiori, Vaticano, Fontana di Trevi, Pantheon. I walked and walked every day and it was really comfortable to stay in Cicerone to reach all those places in a very short time. Breakfast was rather average then good although the buffet was full of products. My room was placed on the 8th floor (attic) so the lift goes to 7th floor only and then stairs, what was no problem at all for me - I could walk even more for this low price which was half price then - special price. Rooms in the attic were rather small, but comfortable enough, bathroom was also O.K. besides the shower tube was not working good. There where rather small windows in the top part of the room, but it was not important to me to have big windows as I spent each day outside of the room. Generally good hotel with some negative points.",
            "We stayed at this property on Oct 22,2006 for 1 nite. We went sight seeing for 4 hrs. During this time you turn in your key and retrieve it upon return of your tours etc. We locked our wallet and personal papers in the locked safe. Upon check-out we discovered money missing from the wallet. Thinking we made a mistake we boarded our plane and flew home. When I checked my credit card I discovered they had also stolen my husband;s card and proceeded to use it on the day of our departure. Fortunately I had notified our cc company as to my date of return and flagged the card. When you turn your key back to the front desk they know who is coming and going and for maybe how long. Therefore they can gain entry to the rooms and have passcodes to the safe. As I am a property manager I do know how this works. Therefore we will only stay at properties with electronic locks that can be traced or keep the key with us. DO NOT , turn in your keys unless you are checking out of any property. This is a green light for robbery. The property itself was nice but the security is faulty. I did notify the GM regarding this matter and the cruiseline that booked us there to investigate.",
            "4 star? well the beautiful hotel next door was definitely 4 star - maybe more - but the Cicerone falls far short. Main problem is lack of invetsment so I guess it belongs to some group or an investment firm whose managers stay some place else. The rooms that have become too dirty or threadbare have had their carpets removed and that begets a sound problem... For goodness sake - go buy a rug. Breakfast was dismal - a good enough looking selection of continental style ingredients but standard very poor and the coffee undrinkable. The location is good and the hotel probably survives on that alone.",
            "We stayed a few nights at this hotel as a part of a tour group. The hotel staff seemed put off or indifferent to answer questions many travelers may have. The internet site on the main floor may or may not work, again, the hotel staff couldn't be bothered with that trivial matter. The rooms were clean and well maintained and was quite comfortable. Breakfasts were OK, and we never did eat in the main dining room or bar. Overal, this hotel is well kept, clean, and comfortable. Hotel Cicerone is situated in a great location. There are a number of gelato shops and restaurants nearby. An outdoor market is not far. Around the corner from Cicerone is a nice coffee shop which has much better cappucino than the hotel. Cicerone is within a short walking distance from Castle S. Angelo, The Vatican, and Piazza Novona. Across the street is a quaint pizzaria for a quick meal. I've had better house wine, but pleasant to sit outdoors and enjoy a meal. Despite the neutral attitude of the hotel staff, I would recomend this hotel, and would definately stay there again.",
            "Hotel is a 10 minute, easy walk to the central Piazza and not far from Vatican City. Was there for 2 nights as part of a tour, so did not try the restaurant onsite. We did get a breakfast buffet that was good, with a lot of choice. Hotel is old, feels like the 70's, but very clean. Front desk staff is accomodating. Rugs in the rooms are old and like sandpaper! Room size is not bad for a European hotel.",
            "Room 745 in the Cicerone (and perhaps others) is like a sauna if the temperature is over 50. The answer is,\" turn off the heat and open the window. There is no air conditioning in Italy until May\". We are smart enough to know to turn off the heat! We opened the window and the curtains in the hope of getting a tiny breeze (which over looks a courtyard, so we sacrificed privacy). It was a sweat box at any time, day or night. This is a sophisticated, busy hotel and there is no excuse for them not finding a solution to this problem, even if it means turning on the a/c.",
            "This was my first trip overseas and being a very particular person, I was quite concerned that the European hotels would not be comfortable. I was VERY happily surprised by the Cicerone! The room was larger than expected, though it did have twin-sized beds. I was actually quite comfortable and they provided me with the number of pillows that I requested immediately. The closet was exceedingly small, but they gave me tons of extra clothes hangers and there was a cul-de-sac in the wall that we used for folded garments and even our suitcases. All in all, more than enough space to be comfortable. The bathroom was larger than those in most American hotels and was very clean. Lots of counter space and we had no trouble storing our toiletries. We didn't eat at the restaurant as there are SO many fantastic options within TRUE walking distance. But we did have a pre-dinner drink every night at the bar. Gianni (spelling?) is the BEST bartender I've ever seen. Funny, professional and informative. He had me hooked on an Italian apertif called Martini Bianco. Try it on ice! Your room key is on a huge brass ball and you drop it off at the front desk as you leave each day. The funny thing, is that anyone can ask for any room key and RECEIVE it! I did this deliberately just to see what would happen. Oh well, the in-room safe worked and I never, ever felt uncomfortable. I've read a lot of poor reviews about the breakfast buffet and I can't say the food was the best but there was never a line and we enjoyed the juice, melba toast and other pastries. I'd highly recommend just walking into a local bar for a coffee and pastry instead. Very inexpensive. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone and that's very high praise coming from me!",
            "This hotel is well located and the lobby looks exactly like the photo on this web. But the rooms in the photo appear large and they are not. They are small. The air conditioning was shut off at 9 p.m. one of the two nights there and not turned back on til 9 a.m. the next morning. That day the temperatures reached 87 degrees and to say that the room was stuffy is an understatement. The staff could be very friendly or arrogant. Ice Machine was broken for a period of time as well and when I went to the bar to beg for some ice I was told that if he gave me ice, then he couldn't work, so NO. There is no courtyard or rooftop area to relax in when you are not touring or running around. I would not return to this hotel. For the price that we paid, Cicerone did not meet our expectations.",
            "Staying at the Cicerone Hotel was great for a solo female traveler. I felt very safe in this area of Rome both during the day and at night. However, it is also advisable for couples or couples with older children. The hotel is located within easy walking distance of the Vatican and St. Angelo's Castle. You can cross the bridge in front of the castle and catch a hop on/hop off bus on the street corner for a 2 hour ride through the city. The concierge is fantastic. He will make excellent recommendations for restaurants and for shopping, depending on your budget. Also, he is very willing to call a cab for a quick ride to any desired location. My only complaint was the fairly small size of my hotel room, but the bathroom was average size. However, that would not stop me from staying here again as I did not go to Rome to stay in my room.",
            "My first stay at Hotel Cicerone was 1989, I've never stayed any where else in the center of Rome since. I was there again on business early Jan. 2012, greeted by the friendly familiar team at the front desk, my room was clean, as always, and very reasonable. Gianni and Marco at the bar are extremely helpful, professional and \"good guys\"! Great location, great staff and reasonable I will continue to book at Cicerone! Pete Ettinger Albuquerque, NM USA",
            "Positives: Good location, within walking distance to St. Peter's Square & Castel de San Angelo. Hotel room was very clean. Good buffet breakfast selection. Reception staff efficient. Restaurants, ATMs and shops nearby. Has a bar that opens til late. Negatives: Room I stayed in was directly opposite the lifts and front windows faced out onto the street so it got a bit noisy. I could hear the traffic on the street and people outside waiting for lift. However, other friends had rooms towards back of the hotel away from the street and lifts so their rooms were very quiet.",
            "Perfect location between The Vatican & Piazza Navona! Very clean, Great AC! Defies rule of thumb to deduct a star from hotel expectations in Italy: Cicerone should be 4 stars! Breakfast average & busy, but sufficient,and coffee served however you like it. Cicerone staff were helpful,friendly, & efficient. Great hotel and great value for money. Would definitely stay there again if in Rome! A few reviews complain about hard wood floors in the rooms. I was absolutely thrilled - the floor is well-maintained and much more easily cleaned than carpetting = hygenic improvement. It, also, makes it feel a bit cooler during the summer heatwaves. Restaurants within walking distance. Checked-in hungry at 11:30 p.m., concierge phoned Ambasciatore di Capri restaurant around the corner to stay open to feed us. Sneered at the tourist menu, but the food was fresh & delicious, decent wine, and not over priced. More eateries on Via Cola di Rienzo, & on side streets toward Piazza Cavour. Tip: October 2006, Rome passed a fixed fee ordinance for airport taxis into the city [Ciampino 30 euros,FCO 40]. But there\u2019s no enforcement! Taxis want double that to pay for their return to the airport. Airport bus to Termini (train station) 6 euros, than taxi 15 euros to Cicerone. Inquire if the hotel arranged taxi pick-up if it would be cheaper. If not, and you\u2019re arriving late, with small children or have mobility issues, best bet is to pay the doubled taxi rate.",
            "Concierge was rude, reception staff even ruder. One of the lifts didnt work. The hall carpet was badly worn. The photos pictured on their website is nothing like the reality. Rooms were decrepit. Whole place needed upgrading. No free internet. Worst hotel we stayed at in Italy",
            "The best point to the Cicerone is its location between the Vatican and shopping areas and the old city centre. For Italy, the coffee was exceptionally poor and tasteless (both in the breakfast room and using room service). The room air conditioning didnt work. We stayed afterwards at the Milton Roma which was also 4-star but a much better price, better standard (flat screen tvs, brand new, great breakfast) and a higher league of satisfaction and service.",
            "This hotel was very nice. The rooms were a decent size. Most of the staff was extremely friendly except one woman. The breakfast was nice. They offered a variety of foods. They had scrambled eggs and bacon along with a ton of pasties and yogurt. The hotel was within a 20 minute walk of most of the best sites. They offered Internet and the prices varied. We paid $17 euros for 24 hours and having brought our laptop we could use it in our room. They also offered Internet down in the lobby for about the same price. This was quietest room (hotel) of all that we had on our trip.",
            "We just returned from a pre-cruise stay in Rome at the Cicerone Hotel. We were pleased at the accommodations, service and location of this hotel. One word of advise, the hotel does not provide wash clothes, as do many hotels in Europe so bring your own if you wish to have one for bathing. The hotel was booked independently from the cruise. We discovered that our cruise line and the tour companies, Globus and Trafalgar also use the hotel for their clients when in Rome. Our room was clean and large enough for the 3 of us. The air conditioning worked very well, helping us to beat the hot Rome summer temperatures. The hotel's location is about a 15-20 walk to Vatican City. There are plenty of stores for shopping plus cafes and restaurants nearby or a short walk from the hotel. ATM's are readily available on the streets. We booked Travel Bound for our transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the ship at the end of our stay in Rome. Travel Bound was reliable, prompt, courteous and less cost than the cruise line transfers that were offered. This hotel is a good choice for your stay in Rome.",
            "Positive: (1) this hotel is really well-located on the Vatican side of the river. Provided you are reasonably fit, it is possible to walk to most of the major tourist attractions in Rome. (2) It is a competively priced hotel Negative: (1) the hotel does not really deserve to be called a 4* hotel - whilst clean, the fixtures and fittings are very tired (carpets threadbare etc) and very dated. Breakfast is very average. (2) Service is, at best, impersonal and, at worst, poor. This particularly applies to front desk staff who could not have been less interested in serving guests. However, even they were outdone by the barman in hotel bar who was both petty and obnoxious. Someone really needs to remind him that hotel guests pay his wages....",
            "Stayed here 1 night. Very close to Vatican City. 2 Internet machines available at a cost. Hotel food is pretty good. Rooms are quite small. Bathroom is decent, but shower is very small. Water temperature was impossible to control (read: scalding). Didn't visit bar (we were out on the town!! ).",
            "Don't stay here unless you want to be ripped off for your valuables. Spent 2 nights here and while we were out to dinner in the evening, after having turned our key in at reception desk, someone entered our room and stole our camera, and 300.00 cash out of the hotel safe. Obviously a staff member as no forced entry. Front desk was indifferent, said I wasn';t the first person and only offered to assist in getting a police report. When we offered the scenario and our opinion that it had to be a hotel employee, didn't want to listen. We are well travelled, and aware of the dangers of pickpockets in Rome etc, but never expected to be robbed in a secure environment.",
            "After the rain and cold temperatures of Dublin proved to be too much for our summer vacation, we decided to take a short trip to Rome and booked the Cicerone last minute for an excellent price. The Cicerone is a perfectly adequate hotel for a short stay. As this was my fourth time in Rome, I can say with some authority that the Cicerone is well-situated in a safe area - within walking distance of many Rome attractions, including the Vatican. We did, however, take taxis over to the area where the Colosseum, etc. are located due to heat and time considerations. The rooms are clean but not particularly contemporary in terms of decor - in fact, the entire feel of the hotel is as if you are in 1970's Rome not 2008's Rome. The rooms are fairly large for a European hotel, though, and there were plenty of towels, etc. My partner noted that the breakfast was not spectacular. if you are looking for a well-located, reasonably-priced hotel for a short stay in Rome, the Cicerone is not a bad choice.",
            "The elevator goes to the 7th floor but our room is on the 8th floor? Yes, just for you, you get to hoof it up a flight of stairs to get to your room. Did I mention that the heat doesn't turn off and the air conditioning doesn't come on until the entire hotel switches gears? Who knows when that is - who cares - it was an oven when we stayed there. We opened our screenless windows to cool the room down. Did we sleep well knowing our windows were open and we were located on a flat roof top? How about that noise all night long...would you get any sleep? It was cooler in the hallway than our room but we just couldn't bring ourselves to camping in the hallway. The \"concierge\" couldn't help me locate a street address where I was to meet a Vatican tour group and I believe the internet access was not free. The employees behind the counter seemed to be annoyed whenever you stood there waiting to be helped. All this, my fellow travelers, and you paid a lot of money for it also! Oh, and it seemed to be filled with American touristas - there was no expresso or capucino at breakfast and the breakfast buffet was boring, boring, boring. (the coffee was awful, the hotel is ancient)",
            "The Cicerone is fine and clean, but with limited or dated facilities. The buffet breakfast can be busy, but there is a 4 hour window to pick your time. An idea is to go to the Vatican early, St Peter's opens at 7, and come back for breakfast, to aviod queues at each. The bar is dreary bling, and avoid the Roman house wine on offer. The SIT shuttle bus from Fiumicino stops at the Piazza Cavour, only 3 mins from hotel. It is 15 euros return. The best restaurants are over the river (Ponte Cavour), such as Gusto and Il Leoncino.",
            "...don't let them put you in room 140. Our room was directly located above the delivery entrance for the hotel. We were woken at 5:15 in the morning by the horrendous sound of carts rolling in and out of the hotel and on and off of a truck, delivering sheets and towels. This went on for ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES. When we complained and asked to be moved, the wouldn't do it, assuring us we wouldn't be disturbed the next day (and we weren't -because the next day was Sunday, when there wasn't a laundry delivery). The rooms are nice (great bathrooms), breakfast food palatable, staff polite, and there are great restaurants and shopping nearby. Just don't let them put you in Room 140!",
            "Stayed at the cicerone in rome for two nights between christmas and new year, it was great value with a large clean room close to the vatican. We walked everywhere from the hotel, to the colloseo, forum, vatican and trevi fountain pantheon etc all walking. although we did have tired feet it was easy access to every attraction and a ten euro taxi ride to the station. The hotel itself is quiet and comfortable and well preiced for its location, breakfast included which was pretty good for a continental buffet (i particularly enjoyed the cold meats first thing) the hotel staff are moderatly friendly, in a particularly italian manner. Our room was veryy spacious with a nice shower and bathroom, two twin beds, though not enough pillows (only two provided for the two beds) it did get a little cold overnight with the temprature contol proving a little tempremental. On the whole i would recomend the cicerone and should i revist rome in the future will be sure to check its availability again, its a reasonable hotel, well priced close to all atractions and hassle free.",
            "Our arrival in Rome was a disaster, as taxi I had booked didn't turn up and there was a taxi strike on. When we eventually arrived at the Cicerone, it was wonderful. Rooms were large and airy, bathroom was immaculate. Air conditioning was very effective and couldn't have survived without it. This hotel was within easy walking distance of all the sites, but make sure to take comfortable walking shoes. We had no problems with staff and the restaurant staff were very pleasant and friendly. Buffet breakfast was great and you could eat as much as you wanted. Only complaint is that there was no form to fill in for the mini bar, so we really didn't have an accurate account of what was used. We would most certainly stay there again and would recommend it to anyone.",
            "Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my mother and my friend, and we had a lovely time there! Very friendly hotel personal at the reseption - all our questions were answered quickly and allways very politely and with a smile. Our flight was leaving late at night so we left our luggage at the hotel after checking out and it worked just fine. The rooms we were staying in were nicely spacious, clean and had everything we needed. Just slightly outdated, spesially the bathrooms, but we aren't huge fans of everything modern so we could live with that. I have to mention that rooms facing the street are just a little bit noisier and have no balcony, the other side rooms had the balconies but there was really not much to see from them and if the balcony door was left open I could hear the noise from the brekfast area in the morning. Breakfast buffet was amazing - lot's of variety and we found everything we wanted! The location of the hotel was good, within a walking distance from all the main attractions of Rome and the city centre with lots and lots of restaurants. It was much more quiet and peaceful on the left side of the river during the night time so we got to sleep really well! Also the metro station was quite close to the hotel. The internet was unfortunatly not free so we had to buy a time ticket to use it in the lobby, but it was reasonably priced.",
            "Overall this hotel was great. The location was central to all the key sights downtown as well as many local cafes and fine restaurants. We stayed during the World Cup finals and could hear some street noise during the night, but not bad considering. The rooms were very nice, clean, and comfortable; no complaints at all. The only negative that we noticed was how oddly rude the entire front desk staff was to ALL the customers. It was almost comical how consistently put out they were at the slightest question or request. They did assist everyone we saw, but it seemed as though they felt dealing with the public was utterly beneath them. Strange and funny, if not slightly annoying. Oh, and the garage is closed on Sunday's so you can't pull your car out if you need it that day. On that note, don't bring a car to Rome in the first place; it's nothing but a hassle.",
            "The Hotel Cicerone is a first-rate hotel located within walking distance of the Vatican and Castel Sant'Angelo and a number of good restaurants. The hotel serves an excellent breakfast, the rooms are well maintained and the furnishings and bathroom area very clean. The hotel staff is courteous and fluent in two or more languages. We will certainly stay at the Hotel Cicerone during our next visit to Rome.",
            "Stayed at the Cicerone in November for a short break. The hotel is good quality, friendly staff, spotlessly clean and is in a good location, just a short walk over Ponte Umberto to Piazza Navona or across Ponte Cavour to reach the popular shopping areas. The nearest metro stop is Lepanto and is only a short walk to the hotel. Regular buses depart from the front of the hotel or from nearby Piazza Cavour. The hotel room was a good size and very clean with a good size bathroom and daily maid service with linen change. The mini bar prices are very high, we moved the contents around and stored our own items in there. We did have to request more pillows as the single one provided is like a wedge of rock!! The morning breakfast buffet is 'american style' serving dreadful bacon and eggs, but a generous amount of cereal, pastries, bread, cheese and meats. Check out is at 11am, and the latest check out you can have is 12pm and costs you an additional 10 euros, we took advantage of the baggage check facility as our departure wasn't till 5 and this is free. The only downside is the hotel is frequently used for cruise ship guests so there was always a high volume of people and bags in the lobby, and you did get the feeling that you were not as important as they were. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would consider returning again.",
            "Very good hotel in an excellent location - close to everything, but away from hordes of tourists. Nice restaurants in the area. Breakfast could have been better - you might have expected a bit more variety so at the end of day 3 it gets really boring, but quality of food is good and service is perfect.",
            "We stayed at the Cicerone Hotel for 5 nights in September 2007 as part of a Globus tour. The room was large (by European standards) and quiet. The linen was changed every day and was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was very clean but old and \u2018tired\u2019 \u2013 it needed to be renovated. The breakfast room provided a buffet breakfast but the bread was stale, no rolls (only croissants), lids left off the hot food, and often the tablecloths were stained (from earlier diners and they hadn\u2019t been changed). Because this appears to be a hotel for lots of coach tours, it was crowded and the breakfast staff were not very friendly (maybe they were getting to the end of a long summer?). One morning we were up for a 6:30am breakfast because the coach tour for the Vatican Museum left at 7am. The queue for the breakfast room was very long and when we got in, the room was crowded, some of the serving dishes had not been replenished and it was a scramble for what was there. This was meant to be a 4 star hotel but the breakfast was about 2 star. The reception staff were knowledgeable but again appeared to be lacking any genuine friendliness toward the customers. There was a nice bar and restaurant in the hotel but they were quite expensive. Location was good with lots of restaurants nearby and a 15 minute walk to the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus.",
            "My wife and I traveled for 16 days with 3 other couples and our trip ended in Rome. We had prepaid our vacation 6 mos.+ prior to our departure date only to find out that one couple could stay at this hotel and 3 couples were moved to another hotel. The only explanation that we could interpret was there was water damage on the 7th floor. I personally walked through the 7th floor and no construction/repairs were taking place. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NON EXISTENT..FRONT DESK STAFF APPEARED TO BE TOO BUSY AND NOT SHOWING ANY CARE OR CONCERN. Personally I fell they were over booked as many tour groups were operating from this hotel. Also as a final note our room was located on a main street,(front of hotel) which wasvery noisy.",
            "This hotel is located within 15 minutes of the Vatican & St. Peter's, and only about 1 block from a small grocery store. Our room on the 3rd floor was clean and updated, not 1970s style like some reviewers mentioned. Just don't expect the Hilton. It's smaller & simpler, but you're in Rome, so it all evens out. Cereal, fruit, lots of bread/meat/cheese to choose from at breakfast, plus bacon and eggs. The hotel is also about 3 blocks from the subway, super convenient. There's also a great little pizza place right across the street from the hotel, where we went on a rainy night when we didn't want to walk far. The only \"downer\" was the hotel staff behind the front desk, who were rude even to my elderly mother, who has the manners of Queen Elizabeth and the patience of a saint. Oh well, we saw them little enough. Just enjoy Rome and don't expect a friendly hotel staff if you stay here.",
            "It was the first 3 nights me and my wife stayed to this hotel in our 2-week travel in Italy. This 4 star hotel provided us with calm nights which were really good for us. It was not very expensive comparing to other 4 star hotels as the location is not in the right centre of the city. But the nearest metro station is 5min from the hotel. So the location was not really the problem. The best thing of this hotel for us was the amenities. The slippers were especially great. We took them and used them for the rest of the travel. There were not so many choices for dinner around the hotel...",
            "I took my mother to Rome and we stayed at this hotel for four nights. The location was very good and the rooms were decent compared to most European hotels. The front desk staff were snooty, rude, and seemed uncaring most every time we passed them. The great qualities? The wonderful breakfast buffet! AND the wonderful Bar-Staff, these guys made up for all the other shortcomings, they sure know how to treat a customer. I would say that I have already recommended this hotel and I would probably stay here again, in spite of the jerks at the front desk.",
            "The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are small, filthy and had black mold on the vents. I never took my shoes off because the carpet was so nasty. The pictures of the hotel look fantastic but I can promise you they are not accurate. The breakfast is horrible and the staff are very unfriendly and never made eye contact. The room was stuffy and had a bad odor and the air conditioner wasn't working. The only positives I can come up with is, 1) the coffee at breakfast was good, 2) the location was good. 3) the shower was good. Hardly worth it though, I would have rather stayed outside on the sidewalk, it was cleaner than the hotel! !",
            "We found the Cicerone to be an above average hotel. The staff was excellent. We were there over Christmas and had booked a car via the internet. The staff told us we were paying too much and helped us rent a far more reasonable new car. They also were able to find us places to dine on Christmas Eve and Christmas Lunch...both meals in Rome restaurants are traditionally closed. Hotel Restaurant was also open on those days. We would return.",
            "We stayed three nights at the Cicerone hotel and if you are from the US you will notice the differences right away. For one, a double room usually means twin beds, and no two rooms are built to look the same. The room was just average for it being a four star hotel. The staff was slow to respond to issues too. Our safe didn't work and in Italy you must protect your money and your passport. They fixed it the last day we were there, even though we asked them to fix it the first night we arrived. We also had a room on the 8th floor but the elevator stops on the 7th! It was quiet though, so that was nice. You can't beat the location of the hotel though, as it is within walking distance (15 minutes) of the Vatican City. All in all, it was clean, not luxurious but decent. Beds were hard, towels stiff, flat, flat, flat pillows, but they had plenty of hot water and the toilet pressure was good. Oh, and whatever you do buy a blow dryer in Italy, if you need one. Their's worked like a vacuum cleaner nozzle set to low--resembled one too! The free buffet breakfast was good. Although American style scrambled eggs are so much better than Italian scrambled eggs (Yuck! ).",
            "cicerone has a very good location, a twenty minutes walk to the spanish steps (with stroller), it had a very nice breakfast but the service is a little slow but overall a good experience. there are a couple of good italian restaurants around. the hop on hop off tours also have pick up points nearby. there is an underground 5 min away. some members of the staff were really helpfull. overall a good hotel.",
            "I just stayed at the hotel for 1 week. The hotel was in a great location. You could walk everywhere important in Rome. 6ish euro cab ride to the train station for day trips. Rooms were ok. Beds and pillows were awful that was my only real complaint. Bathroom was good shower worked fine. Tvs were bad too trying to catch up on any news from home was impossible. Wifi was a joke 9 euro a day. Staff was really nice. The free breakfast ment well and was ok for a few days but after 1 week it was starting to wear on me. For the price it was a decent deal there are probably better hotels to stay at but all and all not bad.",
            "I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in September 2005. It is a large, well appointed hotel with comfortable, clean rooms. It is superbly located just off the Piazza Cavour and close to some good shopping streets. It's about 20 minutes walk to the Vatican and the Piazza Navona. Staff are worth a mention as they were extremely helpful and polite.",
            "I was part of a group that stayed 3 nights in this hotel in the Prati district of Rome. That is just north of Castle Saint Angelo and the palace of Justice. Our group was over 50 people and they got us situated and our luggage off the bus and into our rooms relatively quick. The front desk was OK, could have been a little more friendly. The lobby bar is nice but like all hotel bars a little expensive. The breakfast was very good and offered more than just rolls and coffee. The location is great if you are mainly interested in the Vatican and St Peters. It's also only a short walk to the Piazza del Popolo. This is a very nice plaza with 3 churches one of which (Santa Maria del Popolo) has 2 Caravagio paintings. The view from the Pincio is spectacular. From there, it's a short walk to the Spanish Steps. The hotel seems to cater to groups as there were several there. It's a larger hotel and groups do require a lot of rooms. I'm not sure of the price because it was included in the trip. If I was on my own, I would opt for a smaller, cheaper hotel as you spend so little time in your room when there is all of Rome to see. If your group has booked here, you will be fine. The rooms facing the street are a little noisey. The air conditioning was fine as it is up and running in June. The controls take a few minutes to figure out. Room safe, nice bath, all the regular stuff. Heard some complaints about the internet availability, but we didn't use it. This hotel is not convenient to the forum or coliseum as they are a taxi ride for sure. All in all, a good stay.",
            "The greatest area if you want to explore Rome.Near to metro station and only 10min walking to Vaticano and his museums.Many good restaurants around but to find them you have to explore the small streets(there aren't restaurants at the main street). The room was very noisy(mine was from the side of the main street)and not so clean. The Breakfast was great and with variety.",
            "I stayed in Hotel Cicerone with my Mum as we were told it was close to the Vatican. The hotel was lovely and clean. The staff at the desk and the bar were a little impersonal, but this did not spoil our thoughts of the hotel. Very busy hotel with people and tours coming in and out all day. The concierge helped us to book a tour to Castel Gandolfo, the Pope's Summer residence to hear his Sunday address. We were very lucky as we got the last two tickets on the bus for the trip. Also the same concierge helped us to find our way around Rome and to locate an open top tour bus. We were on the wrong side of the city for the shops and other amenities, but we still had three good days of touring. Stayed here in September 2010",
            "My husband and my parents stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and our expectations were blown away. The rooms were quite large (queen bed with desk, pull-out couch and enormous bathroom). I believe that if you stay on the 7th floor you will most likely get a balcony which was a real treat! We slept with the patio doors open every night! The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful especially when it came to ensuring we got on our buses for tours and our flights back home. The breakfast was great which offered a variety of meats, yogurts, cheeses, cereal, fresh fruit, juices and more! The location was a highlight as the area was great for shopping, dining and wasn't as congested as across the bridge where several organized school trips must of been staying. Whether you're there for 2 nights or 7 nights, I highly recommend this hotel as you will get your barrings quickly and enjoy the location. We even found a restaurant we went back to several times during our stay called San Marco which was a 3 mins walk from the hotel. Food and service was amazing. The restaurant across the street from the hotel was also very impressive. Too bad we waited until the end of the trip to eat there! There is also a quaint little deli/store down the road where we bought meats and cheeses and wine and water to have for mid-day snacks.",
            "We stayed here a few weeks ago on the advice of our travel agent. Given the mediocre reviews on TA, concern was mounting. As it turns out, things turned out quite different from the negative reviews posted here, First of all, the room and bathroom were very clean, no mold to be seen. Room was cleaned at least once daily. A/C worked well, beds were comfortable. Breakfast buffet was similar to other hotels we stayed at in Italy: heavy on pastries with watered down coffee - ask for a double expresso or 2. Location of hotel is convenient to Vatican area sites as well as sites across the river. We used mass transit to get to Coliseum, Spanish Steps,Trevi and other galleries and churches. Bus is very close by and subway is about a 2 1/2 block walk. Before the trip, I had not planned on using mass transit, but the convenience of it outweighed any negatives. Some subway cars look like the 1970's NYC subways with graffiti covering the entire cars, while others were spotless. Just ask the front desk for the correct bus numbers to take. The subway has maybe 20-30 stops total, so it's almost impossible to get lost. Front desk staff was over-the-top helpful in straightening out some gallery reservations WE had messed up in Florence. They stayed on the line, on hold, for over 20 minutes and resolved our mistakes. Great Job!

            "I chose this hotel as it had a restaurant, room service and a bar. I knew we would reach Rome very late and wanted to be able to get food when we arrived. I was so glad I had done this as we were VERY late (thank you Easy Jet!!). The hotel is lovely, very clean and not in the least noisy. Staff were extremely helpful, the Concierge staff particularly. Breakfast was average only, the hotel restaurant for diiner was lovely, but the best thing was the location, everything was quite close, excellent shopping just around the corner, and a few fab restaurants also very close by. I will be back next year.",
            "Unfortunately, I was one of the 'bus tours' stuck staying in this hotel. At the advice of our travel agent, my husband and I let Carnival Cruise Lines book our hotel post-cruise in Rome. I know for a fact that we paid $300+ euros for this hotel and I regret every penny. Out of all the places we visited in Europe, this was the most expensive and the worst - the rooms lacked decor, the double beds were two twins pushed together and VERY hard, the pillows were like pancakes, the bathrooms were dirty, etc. etc. I didn't find the front staff rude - mabey they've worked on their hospitality. The helped me find the right busline for the Colissieum and gave me directions on how to catch the bus. The hotel is in a good location within walking distance to the Vatican. Our friends on the same cruise booked a hotel on their own - paid $175 euro and had a balcony and a view of a piazza. Their room was beautiful. I kick myself thinking about how much we paid to stay here - but luckily we were only there one night and only slept in the room. Overall, I don't recommend - bad value for the price. Feel free to email me with questions.",
            "We stayed at the Cicerone Hotel 2 nights and the hotel has a very good location. Our stayed was very pleasant until last night, when I realized that somebody had stolen me a pair of shoes. Is insignificant the pair of shoes, but what it is important was the attitude that took the hotel staff . Nobody worried about the matter and only they were capable to tell me was \"we are so sorry\".",
            "Arrived at hotel via private taxi which I had booked on the internet. The taxi driver could not speak any english but the staff at the hotel were very helpful in translating for us. We found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself was comfortable and our room was very spacious and well planned out. We had our first evening meal in the hotel. The menu was limited but the main course steak was excellent although a few vegetables would not have gone amiss. The dessert was excellent. However the breakfast was very poor. Not even toast. As it was advertised as an \"American Breakfast\" we did expect something better. We found the hotel to be in a very good location within easy walking distance of many attractions.",
            "Very dissapointed with this hotel. The heater in the room didn't work and despite 3 calls to reception with promises someone was on the way to look at it no one ever turned up. Likewise we asked for extra blankets because the room was cold twice and never saw them. This hotel is one of the noisiest hotels I have ever stayed in. there is no soundproofing on the doors and every one has to slam the doors to close them - it was like fireworks for hours on end every night with all the banging. Also there were noisy kids running up and down the halls and in the next room - I had to buy ear plugs to sleep at night. Despite 2 requests for a quieter room, I was told they were fully booked and it was not possible to change rooms. Be warned - stay well away from this hotel.",
            "We booked this hotel pre cruise and it seemed good value for money to us. We travelled on 21/11 so maybe the hotel was a bit less busy. Must thank the earlier reviewer ( Holly i think) who recommended the nearby restaurant Al Palazzaccio. We ate there both nights of our stay- Could get a good meal with good quality house wine for a really reasonable price for Rome. Room- was clean, with wooden floors, toiletries and reasonably quiet ( as we had requested) being at the side of the building. Location- it was a pleasant 15minute walk to St Peters Square and the vatican musuem Breakfast- was fine for this standard hotel, got our tea/coffee within a couple of minutes of ordering both days. Reception- found them professional but not involved- would not have been confident of their interest if we found ourselves in any difficulties . All in all we'd never been to Rome before and felt we could have done much worse.",
            "We purchased a package from our cruise for the day after in Rome. From the internet information, the Cicerone Hotel looked very nice and we agreed to pay the large fee for the six of us to stay there for one night. The location is very good. You are near the Vatican and can walk to the northern tourist spots easily. The property is run down. The rooms are shabby, The bed was very uncomfortable. I asked about getting a cup of hot water for tea and was told that it was not possible! For what we paid to stay here, we did not recieve good value for our money.",
            "From the television stations, including the constant USA bashing Russia Today, (among others) to the completely rude staff do not expect to be treated decently if you are American. This hotel and staff were equally pathetic and an affront to ones senses. I mean that literally. Be sure to bring along some extra deodorant to hand out to the staff. I think the reason the hotel is called a 4 star hotel is because the sign above the entrance has 4 stars next to the name. The $500 per night room was small, shabby and had a great view of the back of some nondescript building where you could hear and see trash being removed daily. The breakfast buffet actually had POWDERED EGGS (when was the last time you had powdered eggs at a $500 a night hotel) and to get the waitsaff to help in any way was a lost cause. The hotel lobby staff was equally as bad. It was a major effort just to get them to recognize we were in front of them asking questions that needed to be answered. Location was not great but is the only possible reason not to give the hotel a zero rating. We have been to many countries before and have never been treated this poorly. This truly was Euro Trash at its best.",
            "Just returned from 10 nights at this hotel. 3rd time we stayed here. We love the location and the hotel. Never had a bad room--always clean, roomy and quiet. We request an inside-facing room. Many reviews indicate the front desk staff is rude. I don't agree with that -- my opinion, just \"Italian-style\" -- not American-style phony. They are all characters. Ask the \"cashier\" for change? Ha - no change available. Each person has his/her own job, so you can go from one to another. I found this more fun and Italian-style charming. Go with the flow... you are in ROME not Indianapolis! Hotel DOES have alot of tours coming and going, but we were on our own and were not around when they came and went, so they did not bother us. This is a medium size hotel, not a mega resort. There is a small bar/lounge area off the lobby. They try an American-style breakfast with scrambled eggs and bacon...pretty good. Also European-style cheeses and luncheon meats as well as breads, yogurt, cereal, fruit, juices and cappuccino. You can't go away hungry unless you want to. Two good trattorias I would recommend. One just across the street, Grotta Azzurra, has great steaks, pasta and THE BEST Pizza Margherita...try it. Around the corner is our favorite, al Palazzaccio. Great Roman lamb, veal & ravioli with walnut cream sauce. Wine great, also. Waiters - very entertaining - Marcianno speaks some English, loves women and is actually shy. We had the best time staying here and would recommend it to anyone who is open to real Roman people.",
            "When in Rome, this is NOT the place to stay. Although rated as a four star hotel, we found it lacked even the class and charm of a normal three star lodging. The beds were the most uncomfortable we have ever slept in--anywhere. Service was not good and the front desk never answered the phone. None of the hotel departments would pick up calls making it difficult to get any information, room service etc. This is a large property that caters to tour groups which may explain the tepid coffee at breakfast and the lack of genuine customer service. We spent over $500 per night USD for two rooms and did not feel this property was worth half the price. Avoid this.",
            "I stayed here as part of a group, and this hotel seems to handle many groups. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. This is located in an area with many good and small restaurants, and an excellent gelato shop 2 blocks away. Those with rooms on the main street complained of noise, but I was fine- expecting noise in a big city. Breakfast offerings were plentiful and varied, and wait staff will bring you espresso or capuchinno if you don't want the cafe american. I was shocked at the prices in the hotel bar: a shot of limoncello was 6 euro, and a simple gin and tonic was 12 euro! Drink at dinner, not the bar!",
            "We stayed at the Cicerone for five nights in August while on our honeymoon to Italy. I anticipated a true four star hotel due to the positive reviews I read prior to booking this hotel. However, we discovered that this hotel was more like a 2 1/2 star. Here is my quick list of pros and cons: Pros: great central location, walking distance to the Metro, the Vatican, and fun night spots such Campo de Fiori. Cons: Rude staff, charge you for double occupancy (in my case 30 euros additional per day) even after you have paid for the hotel via yoru travel provider (in my case orbitz), rooms are extremely tiny even for European standards, rooms feel stale and their bedding feels filthy, and to top it off they don't even give you an iron - instead they charge you 5 euros to iron a single shirt",
            "While the location of the Cicerone is excellent, in particular for those with a special interest in St Peter's and the Vatican, and while rooms are adequate, we (my wife, adult son and I) were disappointed by a number of things. The hotel seems to be aimed mostly at large groups, and is overall in need of some freshening up. The busy staff at reception were reasonably efficient but not very friendly or welcoming. The television in our room was malfunctioning, and an extinguished lighbulb in my bedside lamp was not replaced over the three days of our stay. The toilet seat in our ensuite was cracked, and there was dirt around the airconditioning unit. A slightly musty cigarette aroma lingered. Worst was the appalling breakfast: bread and cakes were stale, fruit was tinned, eggs and milk watery. We would also recommend against the Grotta Azzurra restaurant across the road: the food is cheap but the service uncharacteristically poor (we were brought the wrong dishes in the wrong order).",
            "I have just returned from a seven night stay at this hotel. It was one of the most enjoyable holidays I have ever had. This was the first time travelling on my own and the staff at the Cicerone were extremely friendly and helpful. Arranging tours and transfer to the airport was no problem to the desk staff - I never found them to be rude - always pleasant and welcoming. The room was very clean and the service in the restaurant was first rate. The hotel is close to the Vatican and Pantheon. If walking is a problem, taxis can be found in the Piazza Cavour near to the Hotel - most fares were between 5 and 10 euros. I would definitely stay here again! !",
            "This is a 4 star hotel on the North Side of the river, about 10 minutes walk from Vatican City We paid 310\u20ac for 3 nights (for 2 people) incl breakfast and we couldnt really fault the value. Hotel was lively with Amercian Tourists getting of the buses day and night. Rome City is 20 minutes walk across the river, and Ancient Rome is a pleasant 35 minutes walk. A good location for all of Rome. Number 70 bus takes you from outside the hotel to the train station, (1\u20ac) and a train takes you the Leonardo Da Vinci airport in 25 mins (11\u20ac). However when we landed we opted to get a shuttle to the airport , this can end up touring the city before dropping you off, but we were lucky and were first (18\u20ac each) taxis were quoting 50 - 75\u20ac Breakfasts were typcial continental but good. Hard for me to find any faults",
            "We stayed at Cicerone hotel for three nights April 2012. The staff was helpful and fast, room was quiet, clean and normal size, bathroom was also big. The location is great, Vatican and St Peter are very near. First we thought that we would be far away from the popular \"piazzas\", which are located at the other side of the river but we walked even down to Colosseum very easy. There are many interesting shops at the nearby Cola di Rienzo and every day we visited restaurants around with the highest ranking in tripadvisor and we did not regret even one time. For its money I think it is a honest proposal.",
            "It was a more modern hotel, but it was obvious that they had not refurbished the rooms and bathrooms since they opened it. The tub did not drain properly and the position of the shower head caused water to leak on the floor. The breakfast was great and the staff were easy to work with.",
            "Make friends with the bartenders, they will treat you right. That was the best part of my stay. Lots of tour groups and cruise goers stay here. Hotel was pretty outdated by American standards. Not much charm either. The concierge was helpful at times but others seemed bothered. What I did like about the neighborhood surrounding the hotel was it was not as touristy as some parts of Rome.",
            "Stayed here with husband and friends recently and arrived early for check in, 11am to be exact. No trouble, we were allocated our rooms immediately and able to go out to immerse ourselves in the beauty and culture that is Rome. Staff were most helpfull and the attention to each request and question was efficient and most helpful. Breakfast was good too and our rooms were most comfortable.",
            "Cannot complain about this hotel at all. The location was great. Walking distance to Castel Sant'Angelo and half hour to The Vatican. It might sound long but with views you get in Rome, I didn't complain. The nearest train station to the hotel is Lepanto which is also around a 5 minute walk. The area also has a few restaurants and of course gelati shops. The staff at the hotel were courteous and friendly. The hotel has a nice foyer and on the left hand side there is a bar. The bedrooms were spacious. Could hardly fault it really. A reasonable sized bathroom and was clean. The beds were comfortable and clean, television had English speaking channels. The breakfast was pretty good as well. A variety of food including cereal, croissants, fruit, yoghurt etc. I really cannot say anything bad about it because there was nothing to complain about. If I was going back to Rome I would definitely go back there again.",
            "Stayed at this hotel from Christmas Day to New Year's Day. Breakfast buffet good - cereals, fruit, juices, bread, eggs and meat. Location great - we walked to all of the sites - the Vatican, Colosseum, Forum, ST Peters, etc. Hotel room a bit noisy on street side of building. No free wifi was a bother but available for 7 euros/24 hours. Staff most helpful. Lunch one day in the hotel restaurant was great - salads, shellfish. We'd stay again simply because of the location.",
            "Great location. Close to metro and in a very nice, quiet neighborhood. You can walk to various sites. The hotel staff was very helpful in every way. They anticipated our needs (giving us info that we hadn't even asked for yet) and helped with some personal phone calls by speaking Italian for us. Nice. It was hot and the room had great air conditioning (very cool). Breakfast was very nice. This hotel and another we experienced this summer can't seem to get the bread and rolls right but otherwise highly recommended.",
            "Just got back from Rome! We stayed for 3 nights at Hotel Cicerone with my wife. I was a bit worried before our trip, after reading so many negative comments about Cicerone. Fortunately we founded those comments false. Room was old, but clean. Unfortunately pillows are flat and hard, but we managed to sleep well enough. Breakfast was nice, but bacon lacks salt. Staff is as friendly as everyone in Rome, if you know what I mean. Location is very good. Traffic is not too loud eventhough there is only single glass windows. Compared to Finnish hotels Cicerone is rather 3 stars than 4, but still ok place to stay.",
            "This hotel is large and rooms are nice, aircon a plus. 6 euros to iron a shirt (no irons) was a bit much! There are lots of americans staying at the hotel so english people to chat to. The main restaurant was nice, its 30 euros for 3 course set menu, 20 euros per bottle of wine. We walked to all the sites and back (good to walk off the food!) Things to be aware of in Rome: If you SIT down at a cafe or gelateria, you pay 6 euros JUST to sit down and up to 4 euros service charge on yoru bill (for ice-cream thats a JOKE) We sat down at one place that wanted to charge us 40 euros for 2 diet cokes, 1 water, 2 ice creams (with the service and seating charges), thats insane Gypsies - there are a lot of Romanian gypsies in Rome, KEEP your bags out of site and closed! I had someone stop a guy from taking my camera and my husbands cell phone was stolen!!! Overall Rome has amazing history so the sites are breathtaking, just do your research for restaurants FIRST so you know where you are eating so you dont get ripped off, it can be EXPENSIVE! Venice was cheaper than Rome!",
            "We stayed at this hotel last weekend for my Dad's 60th birthday celebrations. There were 9 in our party including my 8 year old daughter. Our room ( triple) was reasonably spacious but absolutely nothing like the rooms represented on the website - they were very basic a certainly not 4 star. My parents booked the superior double- on arrival were told there was no double and they would need a twin,the room was more basic than ours, very small and the air con blew out hot air and would not turn off, leaving their room like an oven! They were eventually moved the second day after being told several times that their room was indeed a superior although clearley it wasn't.The pillows were so thin and we only had one each- when we requested extra we were told there weren't any, along with no hairdryer or iron. Breakfast was good but very basic and we had to go elsewhere on the first morning as the queue was up two flights of stairs! Overall I was very dissapointed with the hotel. My parents paid almost \u00a32000 for this accommodation and I would not reccommend it to anyone....they seem more interested on how many people they can squeeze in rather than offering good service",
            "I was pretty worried about this hotel from skimming the reviews here, but it was perfectly OK, even a bit better than OK. It is clearly a big group tour hotel, and we were there through a booking agency, but not as part of a tour. Our rooms (a double and a triple) were clean and comfortable. Not luxurious, but not Motel 6 quality either by a long shot. The bathroom was clean and the facilities all worked well. I especially liked the bright bedside lights. After a week touring Italy where the reading lights were so dim it was hard to read, I appreciated the light by the bed. The wireless internet is grossly overpriced at 17 euro for 24 hours, but at least it worked well for us, with no problems mentioned by another reviewer. The breakfast was plentiful and varied, but not terribly exciting. Very typical of Italian hotel breakfast buffets. The espresso was much better than the watered down coffee, just ask for it. The croissants were sweet and bready (why is it impossible to find a crisp croissant in all of Italy? ), and the eggs were reasonable, for hotel scrambled steamtable eggs. However, the very best, and I mean BEST thing about the Cicerone Hotel is that it is around the corner from Al Palazzaccio, a trattoria with really good food, pleasant staff, not expensive, just really tasty. We had some of our best simple meals there. There's a reason that it fills up as soon as it opens. Go at 7 PM, get seated immediately and get 15% off your bill (their \"happy dinner time\"), or wait until 7:30 and wait an hour for a table. Just go! Via Ennio Quirino Visconti 66-68.",
            "We were on a tour as were most of the hotel guests which made the lines at the breakfast buffett terrible on most of the days we were there. The breakfast is only fair and often ran out of food. The rooms were small, tired and worn. The hotel stafff was marginally helpful. The hotel was in a good location for walking to many sites.",
            "Just back from Rome stayed in the Cicerone I can't say enough about this hotel or it's staff.Was a bit apprehensive before I went after reading some of the reviews,but what a pleasant surprise,the room was spotlessly clean,and it was cleaned everyday with a change of both towels and linen daily.We had a room at the front and we were not kept awake any night also it was warm and comfortable and we had plenty of natural light through the large window.The staff could not be more helpful or pleasant.Will definitely stay there again if we return to Rome.",
            "My wife and I spent two nights at the Hotel Cicerone following a cruise to the Greek Isles. We booked through Celebrity cruise, choosing the Cicerone primarily for its location. We were about a 10-15 minute walk from the Piazza Navona and all the restaurants in the area. We were also able to walk to the Vatican, the Castel Sant Angelo, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and other sites. We took a bus to ancient Rome. The hotel was acceptable for our visit. The included breakfast was OK - we stuck with granola and pastries. The eggs and breakfast meats looked a little dubious. The room was very small, but OK for two nights. Be prepared to pay a lot more in Rome for much less than you would in the States.",
            "jusy got back from a weeks stay at this hotel and i do not rate it as 4 star.it needs a refit our room 607 had a very dirty carpet with a lot of stains on it, there was also a big stain on the ceiling and the wallpaper was marked and dirty.the staff were very friendly and helpful the buffet breakfast was ok but boring and they could not make tea or coffee with hot water. i would not stay here again. rod from cornwall",
            "We arrived at 3pm and our room was ready and nice and air conditioned ( it was 34 degrees celcius out ) so we were ready for a shower and a quick rest! The front desk was very helpful and a nice young man carried our bags up for us. The breakfast the next morning was delicious. Hot coffee and milk at your table in an instant,or cappicino made up for you on order! There was plenty of hot food to go around plus fruit and cereal. We stayed for 3 nights and it was a 15 minute walk to the Vatican and close to many other attractions.There is a decent grocery store 2 blocks away as well as other stores that run for about 2 blocks. We would stay here again!",
            "My daughter and I spent 3 nights at the Cicerone Hotel while joining a tour group in Rome. We found the hotel nicely located for us, we don't mind walking. We were with in walking distance to most of the sights that we wanted to see. The hotel rooms were good sized for a large city. No air conditioning yet, which was a bit uncomfortable for us as we are from Maine. We couldn't leave the windows open at night as we were right above the a busy street and it was fairly noisey. My only complaint was that there was black mold growing in the bathroom tub/shower, other than that, we found the room very clean. We should have asked for more pillows as ours were very flat.",
            "It was our first time in Rome and we didn't know what to expect from a hotel there. The Cicerone was excellent--clean and modern. We had a comfortable room with a king sized bed and a nice sized and very clean bathroom. The hotel price included a full \"all you can eat\" buffet breakfast with American-style coffee!!!! Best of all is the hotel's location. It is within easy walking distance to the Vatican and the great shops and restaurants by the Spanish Steps. We also walked to the Colliseum and other City sites. We highly recommend the Cicerone if you are traveling to Rome. Don't forget to try the cappocinos!",
            "Spent 3 nights at the Cicerone pre-cruise (Carnival) from Civitavecchia. This was our second visit to Rome, and I found the Cicerone superior to all other hotels I've stayed at in Italy. Location is terrific - walkable to Vatican City, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain and great shopping just a few blocks away. Bedroom adequate & we got our requested king-size bed, large bathroom and shower, all clean & neat. Renovations still going on based on appearance of hallway on our floor, but I guess we got lucky--no construction noise. Front desk staff could be friendlier but no complaints with breakfast room or bar staff. Buy a drink at the bar and afternoon/early evening snacks are provided - including their *wonderful* marinated olives. Adequate selection & quality in breakfast room. \"Security issues\" noted by other travelers re door-knob with room key attached I've found is still pretty routine in Europe. With number of people coming & going at the front desk though, I got the feeling anyone could walk up and ask for any key in a box and get it. Regardless, I would definitely use this property again.",
            "We found the front of house staff 'aloof bordering on rude and arrogant. The breakfast were nothing to get excited about, the wait staff in the dining room seemed to be under great pressure, at one breakfast we did not recieve tea or coffee even after asking staff several times. Our first night there was a party going on in the downstairs bar with loud music which could be heard in our 1st floor room quite clearly. we would not recommened this hotel to our frends.",
            "I stayed at the Cicerone for three nights recently. The room was adequate, but could have been much cleaner. I don't know when the carpet was last cleaned, and remnants of it clung to my slippers. The bathroom was large and seemed cleaner than the room. The breakfast was awful, with some of the worst coffee I have ever had. I did order the espresso after tasting the coffee, and that was fine. The waitstaff at breakfast were very nice, but the front desk staff were very rude. If they don't want to be in a service position they should go elsewhere. There were several tours at the hotel while I was there, but that was no excuse for the rudeness of the staff.",
            "The Cicerone is in Prati, an area Romans do there shoppin in. It is also near to the Vatican and one can easily walk to the historic centre in 15-20 minutes. It does not rate highly on charm, having a 1980s look to it. Our rooms were baking hot and, despite repeated requests to reception staff, it was impossible to have the heating switched off. It seems that Roman hotels, like Roman apartment buildings, have set dates for switching heating on and off. Opening the French windows to the terrace was only an option when one was not in the room as every bus in the city seems to roar its way along Via Cicerone. Note: colleages with rooms not on the street side could open windows without having problems of noise. Breakfast was uninteresting. The hotel seems to be popular with Japanese package tourists.",
            "We spent a week at the hotel. Nice sized room, clean and confortable. The breakfast buffet was good. The hotel is located in a very nice area to be in. Easy walk to major attractions and good local neighbourhood resturants. Disposable plastic cups, no wine glasses in the room don't allow this to turly be a 4 star hotel, but it is still superior to many others. We had some problems with the tour company that booked us and the hotel worked to get everything cleared up and in order. Great staff that speak english.",
            "We stayed in this hotel at the end of our family vacation. We had actually booked accommodations elsewhere which we walked into and immediately started looking for something else. The Cicerone is what we found. It is comfortable and well maintained. It is certainly not the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in (I didn't walk around without slippers in the room) and I will probably never return. The front desk staff was somewhat helpful, but nobody put themselves out for us. It is close to the Vatican but since most tourist sites are on the other side of the Tiber River, each taxi ride was more expensive than it might otherwise have been. A less hectic and harried search would probably have located a hotel that better fit our needs.",
            "This hotel is decent. Location is OK, not too much around it, but not as bad as some desolate locations. Overall cleanliness and service of hotel is good. You must remember European hotels are not like American hotels, with the luxuries of a strong a/c and centered locations, but I did enjoy my stay. Just being in Italy makes it worthwhile.",
            "Having read the past reviews (on this site) I was a little anxious about staying in this hotel. I am glad I did though as it was lovely! Perhaps I was lucky but my bed was quite comfortable and I got round the \"not so plump\" pillows by asking for 2 of them. I found the front of house to be all very friendly and helpful, perhaps they were responding to my cherry disposition. Ironically the only thing I wasn't that crazy about was breakfast. I thought that it could have been of a higher standard but I did manage to stuff myself every morning before hitting the sights... I would stay there again and I would recommend it to my friends.",
            "We loved the location, close to the Vatican and St Peter's but furniture and linens were quite worn and we had a view of a concrete wall.. It is pricey for the quality of the room. The breakfast choices were good. We stayed here for three days and then moved to the Dei Mellini for the last three days and liked that property much better.",
            "We have stayed at the Cicerone Hotel on 4 occasions. The staff never seem to change. They are really helpful and the position of the hotel is great. Many of the rooms have been upgraded and it is a very comfortable room, certainly not delux but very adequate. The neighbourhood is really safe to walk through in the evening. The hotel is used by many cruise companies for pre or post Rome stays. The hotel can also organise a taxi down to Civitavechia before or after the cruise and the prices you get from the hotel is actually much cheaper than if you organise privately. Breakfasts are great and their is always more than enough to have. Will always use this hotel while in Rome",
            "We stayed there for one night to be near the Vatican....and found ourselves in a rather dismal room that was tired and equivalent of a tired Comfort Inn. It was clean and functional. The bed and pillows were hard, but we have found that to be the case in the two hotels that we stayed in Rome. There is nothing right around the hotel, but it is certainly not a bad walk to the Vatican, to Piazza Novanna/Pantheon...a very pleasant walk actually.. The breakfast food was plentiful but not appetizing at all...the orange juice was strange!! If you are looking for a serviceable place to stay, then it would be ok....but don't get your hopes up about staying somewhere nice...and with the price of the room, you would expect much nicer!! elitha 10/21/09",
            "This location was great! It is close to the Vatican as well as the Spanish Steps and Piazza Navone and the famous Fontana det Trevi. The American breakfast buffet was OK, but it was same thing everyday. I expected some variety from 4star hotel . They don't change the sheets for a whole week we stayd there. The staff were very professional but I missed the friendliness except Giuliana she was very friendly and answered with a smile. For Swidish Tourist! !one of the Staff with name \"Rosita\" is from Sweden take advantage of that oppurtunity if you have probelm with english, she is very nice. Tips!! !If you want to go to the beach then I would recommend you to take the train the red line towards Termini then ask for il Trenino towards Ostia di Lido. The best beach is on Stella Polare. there are very nice places but it will cost you between 8-10 EUR for Entry + sunbed and Umbrella . or do as we did take the free beach you dont need to pay anything for Entry. we paid \u00a85 EUR only for sun chair with little Umbrella mounted on the sun bed \"two in one\". Ask the livewatcher at the beach he is the one who rent them. it will take about 35 minutes to reach the station Stella Polare with the train. and it is very cheap and save to take train in Rome.",
            "This modern hotel is located close to the Vatican and also to Via Cola de Rienza one of the best shopping area of Rome. It is within walking distance of the Vatican, the shopping district, Piazza di Populo, and Castel San Angelo. While the area appears more residential access to sites and tourist areas is easy. There are trattorias and small shops nearby also for pizza or a dinner on your own.",
            "This was the second time that me and wife stayed at the Cicerone, and we are ready to return as often as we land in Rome. The location is superb, specially because it's very close to major atractions in town but still secluded in a very residential area, not too turisty and off the beaten track, but if you want trendy restaurants and boutiques, everything stands at a stone throw. The rooms are confortable, clean and confortable. The beds are confy and bathrooms toileteries surprisingly nice. The staff tends to be very busy, but try a little italian and they will open their hearts!! !",
            "The reason we stayed at this hotel, booked with Insights Tours. Stayed there Sept 10,11, 2006. Rooms were nice. Not alot of restaurants in the hotel's area. \"Beware\" checking out on the morning of Sept 13th, they wanted to charge us for two breakfast's of 31.00E that was included with our trip. Finally they said forget it.",
            "I know the \"star\" ratings are different in Europe from the U.S., but this was like a bad Motel 6. Even when we complained about the filth (see mold in showers, carpets not vacumed, etc) and where upgraded it was bad. The only redeeming feature of this hotel is that it is well-located.",
            "Our family of 4 bked through globus/monogram so it was an all inclusive packge on what rated as high superior . The facility was extremely clean and cared for daily. The bedrms were small but the beds were somewhat soft enough, the amenities in the bthrm was sufficient. The breakfast although on the expensive side was worth it specially if on the move the whole day and the next real meal is early afternoon. There is a wonderful lobby with a bar on one end and a talented piano player (on a grand piano) that couples enjoy, relax at the end of the day and get to do a little dancing. The vatican is a short 7 minutes away passing through the just building and the angel bridge. Beware though passing through the small plaza when alone at night. It is not well lighted and that plaza seems to be a gathering place for odd groups.",
            "Having trawled the web for a nice hotel and failed through the sheer volume of hotels we decided to book through our local travel agent who recommended the Cicerone Hotel. We were not disappointed! The hotel was easily accessible to most of the sights - the nearest being The Vatican. The rooms were a reasonable size and more importantly, spotlessly clean and well appointed. We enjoyed a fabulous meal in the hotel's restaurant which was a little expensive but well worth it . Considering the long walk around the city taking in the beautiful sights, the last thing you want to do is go out to find a restaurant to eat. Diane from Doncaster",
            "Spent two nights this week with my teenaged daughter. The room was OK - small, not fancy. Didn't feel like a 4 star hotel. Breakfast was mediocre at best. Staff was rude and unfriendly, not attentive to our needs, would not supply an adaptor, did not send promised technician to repair hair dryer. But the location was good - easy walk to the Vatican, shopping, good restaurants and gelato. Good Chinese food around the corner. Rome is HOT in the summer!! After being in London and Paris, we were happy with the cheaper prices in Rome.",
            "We found the Cicerone to be clean with a cheerful staff. Our room was spotless and comfortable. The breakfast was good and plentiful. The location was in walking distance (for us) to alot of the attractions, very centrally located. We would certainly stay there again.",
            "We have been guests at the Cicerone Hotel in Rome 5 times. What keeps us coming back? Location, cleanliness and the best Bar Staff in Rome. Marco Tozzetti is not only a great bartender but he is very helpful on things to do and see in Rome. Gianni, Ilaria and Dominico also can not do enough for you. We stopped by the bar boeth before and after dinner to enjoy their company; talk about what we had done during the day and get ideas for our next day. Can't wait to go back. When in Rome, if you don't stay at the Cicerone be sure to stop in and enjoy a drink with them."

            "We purchased airfare and hotel from Travelocity. Purchased room at Mercure in the suburbs. Hotel closed for Christmas so we were booked at the Mercure Arthur Frommer in city center instead. Thank you Jesus. Arthur Frommer located within walking distance of Dam Square, Rembrandt Square, Rijksmuseum, restaurants, shopping and canals. The furniture is spartan but that is OK. Breakfast buffet is pricey but there are plenty of alternatives. Staff spoke English well and they were very helpful. Overall, I was very pleased with the hotel and would recommend for anyone on a modest budget. You will not be disappointed.",
            "The hotel has excellent location- close to train station (only few stops by tram or 10 min by taxi), close to all museums and all attractions you should visit in Amsterdam. If you like walking everything is within walking distance. The museums and art galleries are app 40 min walk (or 10 min tram if you dont want to walk that far), Heineken museum is just around the corner, Anne's Frank museum is 15 min by walk- honestly I couldnt imagine better location. The hotel itself is lovely- its off the main roads so its nice and quiet (we had really good sleep, not disturbed by any noise) and the rooms are simply charming. After stays in hotels that look the same, regardless where you are, its such a nice change as the room was lovely with more of personal touch. It wasnt very spacious, but its Amsterdam, you wouldnt expect lots of space, and the design of the room made up for lack of space. We had breakfast only one morning, and although its a bit pricey as other reviews mention, we were absolutely spoiled with choice. The selection was very impressive, much better in other Mercures. All members of staff vere excellent, very helpful and always there for you. There is simply nothing bad I could say about this hotel and our stay, everything was lovely, some things eg location, better than expected. Definately will book this hotel for next trip to Amsterdam:)",
            "Good location, quiet, yet within very easy walking distance to the main shops and bars and restaurants. Trams 16, 24, 25 run from close by to city centre tickets can be purchased from most shops. Trams are every few minuets, so you are never waiting around for long. On arriving at Schiphol airport, and not knowing our way around, we went to the tourist information desk and bought a return ticket for the shuttle bus, which took us right to our hotel. If you have never been to Amsterdam before like us, then I can recommend you use this or you may never know how to get to the hotel. For 19 euros it was easy. The hotel staff are all very helpful and polite, the rooms are basic and well maintained, and not bad size wise, which were cleaned every day. They have a free safe deposit box, T V with some English channels as well as Dutch. The bathrooms are average in size with shower, however the showers do not have doors, and water goes all over the bathroom floor unless you turn the shower head against the wall, but there is always plenty of hot water. Continental breakfast, with a good variety on offer. Part of the hotel is none smoking, which suited us fine. You must buy a good map, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on the small free maps that are given away. Always be careful of the cyclists, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a dam and seem to have right of way, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to stop if you get in their way. The Anne Frank museum is well worth a visit, but be warned, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very moving experience. The Heineken experience is also a must. For 10 euros you get about 3 hours of fun and drinking. We certainly had a good time at the Arthur Frommer, and can recommend this hotel to the more mature traveller.",
            "Our room was small but had high ceilings and a large window so felt light and airy. It was on the first floor (middle floor) and overlooked Noorderstraat. It was mainly pretty quiet.The bathroom (with walk-in shower) was generous and well appointed. The double bed was spacious and very comfortable and we slept well. There was plenty of wardrobe space and excellent flexible lighting. The breakfast was of a high standard - freshly squeezed orange juice, lovely croissant, eggs cooked to order - lots of choice.. The staff were always polite and helpful. The location was perfect for us, near the quieter pretty Prinsengracht and Reguliersgracht canals, but also only yards from the tram stop. It was easy enough to walk to the museum area and Vondelpark, or along the canals to Anne Fran's House, or into the city centre. Several good cafes nearby. (The Myrabelle deserves a mention here). A great stay. Recommended.",
            "We stayed here in Nov 2009 and although the colour schemes are a little bold, we found this place very good value for money and a good all round hotel. The 3 person room we stayed in was a decent size, clean, and well maintained. The only potential issue was the rather small corner window, which did almost nothing to light up the room (althogh this was acceptable and I belive ours was the only room with the unique window, due to it's postiion on the building corner). We didnt try the breakfast, but it seamed very nice (and expensive at EURO 16.50). I would happily return to this hotel and recommend it to others.",
            "The hotel is very good and clean. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 5 minute walk to Flower Market and other attractions, so very close to the city centre, but in a quiet street. There are plenty of nice restaurants and bars nearby. Staff at reception were helpful and friendly. The only weird thing is that the cleaning lady knocked at the door at 9:30 AM (on the 2 mornings we stayed there) and within one second she was inside the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not very good for privacy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Apart from that everything else was fine. Would stay there again and recommend it.",
            "The hotel is close to tram but far away from the noise. Located on a quiet street, this is a true gem. And it is less than 5 minutes away from all the action. In my opinion it's strategically located between the Museum area, the tourist area (Dam) and the trendy Leidseplein. All within walking distance, no more that 10 min. Tram is about two blocks away. The staff was courteous and Ismael was truly helpful, even though he was a trainee.",
            "Stay in this hotel many times and as always the staff are greater. Only compliant is about the book web site which makes it difficult to book long periods. This stay was for 19 days but had to be broken into shorter say becuase the web site would not let me book it as one stay",
            "the rooms and bathroom was ideal for a short weekend away, the bed comfy and the general condition was nearly new. one poor point was at reception you cannot have a room allocated before 2 or 3pm 9although luggage storage offered), unless you upgrade 30 euros to get your room early. I will assume the hotel is always full and so no rooms are free until once cleaned. also a tea and coffee tray is 5 euros, being a regular traveller its usually the norm to have them available within the room rate",
            "I have previoulsy stayed at this same hotel before with 2 friends and our triple room was fine. Good decor, good beds... this time, I came back for a double room and had a somehow negative surprise: room was much smaller, with a much poorer decor... and very very very noisy - every single morning, we were woken up by the continuous noise of doors, cleaning... really unpleasant. We did get an early checkin, which was great, but the staff was not pleasant with us at all - made crystal clear to us they were doing us a big favor. And that continued during the whole stay. Lobby was recently renewed and looks much better - but not a very good taste, I would say. The room was small, but fair - good equipment, good bed. Bathroom was small as you expect in Europe -and had the basics. Just an important note to women: they do have a hair dryer but it's crap. So if you need a dryer, better take yours, because that things if just for them to put at their website they have a hair dryer. They do have ONE single PC you can use with internet access - but many sites are bloked. And I mean regular sites - I couldnt access my email because the site was blocked (it's my company's public website), and I guarantee there's nothing pron or not appropriate there. Staff just told me there was nothing they could do. At the end, I could at least print my boarding pass there, at least... Price was not cheap, so it's definetly not a good cost benefit relatoinship. The only excellent thing is location - between the center and the museum district, near cannals... really nice location. At the end, the experience showed us that the management and staff really do not care about guests' experience - all those details that show they care lack, at all levels.",
            "This charming hotel in a quiet mews near many attractions, excelled in all areas. The entrance and recepton staff were welcoming and efficient. The bedroom we were allocated had taseful elegant, high quality furnishings with a comfortable bed, pillows and warm duvet. Other room facilites included a mini bar and flat screen TV. The shower room was a good size with a high standard of cleanliness. The breakfast room had been well thoughtout with a large variety of food and the only minor irritation , was no facility for making toast.",
            "Just returned from a fab weekend in Amsterdam. We booked a triple room which initially I had reservations from previous reviews, but there was plenty of room. The bathroom was nice and modern however there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke in there which was slightly off putting. The beds are very comfortable with feather pillows and thick duvet. One thing that let it down was the air conditioning. It was too hot in the night and for some reason the air con kept switching to warm air during the night. It was quite noisy trying to sleep at night with people banging doors when they got in but I thankfully packed ear plugs which blocked everything out. The hotel is in a great location, approx 15 min walk to Dam square which we were happy to do each day. There is a tram stop nearby too which we used once, very straight forward. Overall I would recommend this hotel but I think it's pot luck with what room you get.",
            "I very much wanted to give this hotel five stars, but after a long journey, the first night was farcical - no sleep all night because of the noise from the central heating and then to cap that, deafening work started at 7am on the adjacent building site right outside my window. I fully accept that the hotel has no control over the building work, but it appears that the central heating problem is known to the owners. I know from my own experience of operational management that these things can be difficult to fix immediately, and the commendable staff changed my room without hesitation, but the fact remains I lost a whole night's sleep and, as that is the main point of a hotel, I feel I wasted my money and lost the enjoyment of a day's sightseeing through tiredness. I would have been very upset if I had only been staying one night and had a business appointment next day. Once the room was changed though, the noise - whilst still there - was bearable, and I was able to enjoy the very comfortable bed, good spacious shower and efficient, friendly service. The hotel is extremely clean, tastefully decorated in a modern style and situated in a peaceful residential area, although most attractions were only ten minutes or so away. I didn't try breakfast and I thought having to pay 5 Euros (per day) for a basic tea/coffee facility in the room was rather odd, but maybe that's the way things are done here. Overall, the good points notably outweighed the bad points. Once the heating problem is resolved and the building work completed next door, this will be an easy five out of five and I would definitely come back again. Until then, unfortunately, I can only rate it three stars and advise that visitors proceed with a degree of caution at the moment.",
            "I booked at the Mercure because I wanted a moderately priced hotel not far from the city center. I didn't expect it to great but overall it beat my expectations. The room was clean, the bed was reasonably comfortable. There's a kindergarten just outside so there's a nice cheery vibe around the neighborhood and not a little noise at times (which I personally found rather charming). The front desk staff were cheerful and helpful, though I must say I didn't present any particular challenges. Overall, I thought this was a good place to stay. That said, I didn't love the fact that the closet and bathroom were on a different level than the rest of my room, accessible via a metal staircase. It's tedious to get up in the middle of the night and fumble up the steep stairs (slight digression: Amsterdam on the whole has the steepest stairs I've ever seen. Plan those trips to the bathroom accordingly). My room may have been the only one in the hotel with this arrangement. Or not. They didn't tell me. If they had asked whether I wanted the climb-to-the-bathroom-room I probably would have declined. I also would have had a lot less beer the first evening I was there. At least I got my exercise during the night. One thing to remember if you stay here: keep the address with you. Cab drivers without exception didn't know the hotel by the \"Mercure Arthur Frommer\" name and there are 3 Mercures in town. If I hadn't had the address in my phone to show them they never would have known where to go. Bottom line for me: I would go back happily, but would avoid room 112. Value for the money was better than expected.",
            "The room was small, plain, and clean. The bath was about the size of one in an airplane, but there was a small pub on site, and it was a short walk to downtown. all in all, for the price I was satisfied",
            "We stayed here for 3 nights in November 2010. The hotel is on tram line from airport. Get off at Heinekin Brewery and its a 3 block walk. It down a very quiet street so it was nice sleeping. We did not eat breakfast here. There was a bagel and coffee shop 2 blocks away and also some restaurants in the area. But it was just 3 or trams stops to Dam Square. Front desk was helpful with a map. Would stay here again. Rooms nice and bathrooms very nice",
            "Great hotel in a fantastic location, hidden away in a mainly residental area but just a few minutes walk from the Prinsengracht. Our room was delightfully decorated and very quiet. Comfortable bed and the bathroom facilities were excellent. The TV had a number of English speaking channels and the mini-bar well stocked and not hugely overpriced!! My only gripe is the price of the hotel breakfast, 17.50Euro per person is rather crazy in my opinion - and obviously we didn't partake! There are plenty of local cafes nearby and even an organic supermarket in the vicinity should you wish to purchase food on the go. We didn't sample the downstairs bar - but it looked smart. I'd definitely recommend :)",
            "Stayed in this hotel on probably the most freezing weekend ever in Amsterdam was -15 degrees, also coupled with some snow, Scotland where we left was more tropical. Asides from this the hotel was excellent arrived at 245am due to airport delays the man on reception was friendly and helpful and the rooms were warm. Cleanliness was excellent in the rooms and the staff on reception were helpful too all with excellent English. Only downside was paying for the tea but bearing in mind the temperature I probably wouldnt have took this option if it hadnt been so cold out. The tv had English spoken channels too which was handy. The location was great a nice quiet area but still close enough to the action once figured out where we were going. Would definetly stay here again when I return to Amsterdam.",
            "Booked this hotel as two ,middle aged ,women away for a few days break, after reading recommendations from others on here. We haven't been been disappointed at all. It's in a quiet street away from the main touristy places yet only a short stroll away from everything. Just been to the steak restaurant on the same street which is lovely (too shattered to walk any further after been out all day till six). And now sat watching tv in the room. We booked a privilege room (214)which is great and has tea making, dressing gowns slippers and a large bottle of water everyday - it was only a few euros more booked in advance on the Mercure site. Yes the walls aren't soundproofed ,it's an old building. Do wish they would get some better door closers on the rooms to stop them banging closed though - or only allow considerate guests to stay! We had breakfast at the bagel cafe and broodhuys, both great - broodhuys doesn't take cash and doesnt have any normal English breakfast tea though. We have walked and walked, had a great time and would stay again.",
            "If you want to stay in historic Amsterdam, in an old Amsterdam building, tucked alongside the canals and cobbled streets, this is the place. The rooms have the big windows and high ceilings that you expect from an old Amsterdam house. The light floods into the room. The bathrooms are a little compact, but kitted out with everything you need. The reception team are very helpful. It is a 15 minute walk from Muntplein or Leidseplein if you want tourist restaurants and bars. It is a 2 minute walk to the nearest tram stop. We ate out for breakfast, or picked up a picnic from the one of the many stores/deli's nearby. The buffet breakfast in the hotel is EUR 16 per person, but we did take up the EUR5 a day coffee/tea making facilities.",
            "I enjoyed the location of the hotel, but the room had a very worn out, dated look to it, and the bathroom was ridiculously funky. The carpet seemed unclean, the blankets and pillows very old and uninviting. Most annoying was the low level of sound proofing in the facility--this is a good hotel for people who don't mind the sound of doors slamming day and night. Many of the guests seemed to have little regard for others' sleep; there was lots of hollering out in the hall. The windows could use improvement, as even on the quiet street we faced, there were motorists and drunken revelers passing by in the wee hours of the night. While some of the desk clerks we encountered there were helpful and professional, one was downright rude about giving directions to the VanGogh museum upon our arrival and another was curt and impatient. Breakfast was just so-so; we only ate there once and preferred to walk to Village Bagel on the main street. Unfortunately, the main street leading to Noordestraat was all torn up and under construction, which gave our approach to the property an industrial, unpleasant feel. But once we wandered through the canal streets east of the hotel, we fell under the spell of Amsterdam. We wished we'd opted for a hotel on a canal, with a little more charm. The Mercure Arthur Frommor was just utilitarian.",
            "The Mercure Arthur Frommer is located right on the edge of the City Center, making it an ideal hotel if you're in Amsterdam for work. The staff are great and the facilities are decent. If you go in the winter, the heaters in the rooms tend to take a long while to warm up, so it can get chilly at times. Overall, it was a decent hotel and great value!",
            "Pros: Good location. Very friendly staff. Cons: Hotel is run down. Clean, but need some attention paid to it. Room was really small. Located in an alleyway, which made getting home at night a little scary. Bottom Line: Basic hotel if you're looking for something cheap, but I wouldn't stay here again.",
            "The hotel is located in a quiet side street just outside the main centre of Amsterdam. It is within easy walking distance of the central area of Rembransplein, Dam and Leidseplein, museum area. The hotel is well-served by public transport, particularly by tram with direct lines to the Central Station in about 10 minutes (4-5 stops) and Leidseplein (2 stops/10 mins walk). The hotel is very clean and has a modern interior. The room was well-laid out, the bathroom was clean and modern, there was a wide range of TV channels in several different languages. Quality of sleep was excellent (very quiet area) although I was woken each morning by slamming doors, whether from other guests or cleaning staff I am not sure. I did not take breakfast at the hotel. At 16 euros this appeared to be quite steep. The hotel had 1 internet terminal in the lobby, which was heavily used, and when I did have a chance to use it it was very slow. However this is an excellent choice for a hotel in one of the most popular cities in Europe.",
            "Hotel was ok and in a very good location, but the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac45 per night parking charge was extortionate. We were also advised on arrival that our rate included breakfast but when we checked out we discovered it wasn't and had to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17.50 each per day. We'd have eaten out if we'd known. The rooms and cleanliness were fine.",
            "This is a great little hotel - it's not posh, it just does the essentials really well. The location is great - about 20 - 30 minutes walk to the Old Town and 10 minutes from Leidesplein or Rembrantsplein. It's in a quiet residential area so not much traffic or drunken reveller noise. Rooms are small but nicely decorated. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Breakfast was tasty. All in all, \u00c2\u00a3300 for a double room for 3 days including breakfast seemed like a damn good deal. Would definitely stay again.",
            "We choose this hotel from trip-advisor recommendation. Great choice, best location, very nice and quiet street. The service is very effective. The room was clean and spacious. The hotel was recently renovated and everything is new. Breakfast and breakfast room - a must. In summary, we will be back!",
            "We stayed here as part of package deal and it turned out to be a very pleasant hotel. The location was very good and within easy walking distance of everything. The street was very charming. The hotel was clean and the room was a good sized. There is nothing so special about this hotel, but if you are looking for a safe, reasonably priced hotel in a nice area of Amsterdam, then stay here.",
            "The location is great: a quiet neighborhood, but a moderate walk to anywhere in central Amsterdam and quite close to the museums. Just a few blocks to several trams. Rooms are small (judging from the floor plan, mine was one of the smallest, but comfortable and with a relatively large bath and shower). I think the soundproofing is a bit lacking; I wasn't bothered much by noise, but I could imagine that noisy neighbors in the hallway might be a problem. Breakfast is good, but not cheap. Staff is efficient and friendly.",
            "We stayed for 2 nights and wanted to stay near Leideseplein but didnt want to go over budget. This hotel is definitely off the beaten path, but its not too far from some of the main areas. The plus is that you are in a quiet area and its peaceful to walk around and not crowded with tourists. Very comfortable beds, good size rooms and bathrooms. Internet worked good. Great bagel cafe 3 blocks away around the corner from the hotel. Wasn't in Amsterdam too long so didnt spend too much time in the hotel. But it was all we needed and not to bad of a walk to get places. Would definitely stay here again, however, we may want to stay in a different area if we go back.",
            "Small hotel on a small and quiet side street in Amsterdam. Had to walk a bit to get to the central area but it didn't ever take long. Nice and helpful staff. Good selection in their breakfast bar. Rooms are a bit tight for a family of 3 (our child is 17) but they did manage to fit in an extra bed without too many problems. We were never in the room for anything but sleeping any way. If you like quiet and a little off the beaten path then this is the perfect hotel. We would stay here again. Also...there is a shuttle from the airport to get here and take you back again. It does cost but inexpensive compared to a taxi.",
            "This hotel is located in a quieter area of Amsterdam about a 5 min walk to the main action. It's actually pretty good if you dont want to be around all the sleaziness of central Amsterdam. Price was great about $70 for the room as we booked pretty early. Rooms a little small but beds were very comfy. Wifi a little strange giving you vouchers with access numbers that expire after 24 hours. Still a great midrange option in Amsterdam.",
            "Stayed at this property on March 12 - 15 with a friend. Staff was very nice, although no one offered to assist us with our bags. At the entrance, there's a small flight of stairs and the elevator is tiny. They have a computer in the lobby where you can surf the internet for free. Or you can purchase wifi time via T-Mobile HotSpot in your room...you can buy by the hour and split up your time during your stay. Front desk manager was nice enough to print out my train confirmation when asked if they had a printer (which they do not have a public one). Room was okay...not huge but not tiny. It was comfortable for us. Location was wonderful. We were within walking distance of the Heineken Experience and the main street to catch the tram. There was a supermarket nearby, coffeehouse around the corner and some places to eat. It cost us $11 for a taxi ride from Centraal Train Station to the hotel. I would definitely stay here again. We didn't do the breakfast so I have no comment to offer on the food.",
            "Have stayed here a couple of times. The hotel is basic for the cost and so much more could be done with it based on its great heritage. The hotel doesn't offer much by way of facilitys, expensive breakfast and a small dingy bar but the rooms are comfy dispite being very basic but have some charm about them. The loctaion is the best thing as it's in a quiet residential area next to a small school yet it is only a short walk to all the main areas. That is the main reason I always choose this hotel.",
            "We stayed here for 4 nights and wanted a nice hotel to use as a base when sightseeing around Amsterdam. It was ideal for us! We got a tram from the central station and then a short walk to the hotel. The hotel is tucked away on some residential streets, so nice to be away from the hustle and bustle. Our room was a good size - big, comfortable bed, ensuite shower room (small but newly refurbished). We were out and about sightseeing so only came back to our room to sleep, but had a good stay and would definitely recommend it. The bedrooms are nice and fresh as have been recently refurbished. It was good value for money.",
            "Stayed here for a three night break, had originally booked a standard room, but upon arrival early Monday decided to take them up on their offer of upgrading to a superior room for an extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 per night, and room was available immediately. Stayed in room 112 which is a large room, with floor to ceiling double aspect windows, flooding the room with natural light... Lovely. Bathroom is compact, but everything is there and plenty of amenities which are topped up every day. We purchased a four day pass for the trams, and within a day realised how very very easy it is to use, and the fact the hotel is slightly further out than others, means that you have a really quiet night sleep. Everything is sparkling clean. The reception staff are polite and helpfull, and more than happy to provide you with information on where to go, helping us to print off our boarding passes ... We had their mini breakfast one day ... So we sat in their bar area and Amin (I think) served us in there. Very charming, if we wanted more coffee etc not a problem, just ask. I didn't like having the packet creamer on our coffee tray in our room, not a problem, within five minutes housekeeping presented me with a jug of milk to put in our fridge. I like the fact the hotel decor is different, eccletic and so very clean. Thank you for a lovely stay.",
            "All I want from a city hotel is comfortable bed, big breakfast and great location. Mercury Arthur Frommer was a great choice. 5 min walk to Rembrandt Sq, 10 min to Leidse Sq., and about 10min ride by tram to Central St. ( stop is just 3min away - 2.80eur ). Location is very romantic and safe. Building is in residential area...no traffic...what a blisful sleep accomplished by very comfy bed and soft linens. Rooms are not huge but ok and showers are modern and clean and contains some shower gel,soap etc. Decor is corky and fresh, especially the stripy carpet is really cute. Check in fast, not overly friendly, but decent enough. And breakfast (included in my deal) was fabulous. Big selection of breads, pastries etc. Juices,coffees, fresh fruits, cold bar...more than you need. So overall stay was very pleasant and next time in Amsterdam...I am back in Mercury.",
            "I cannot believe the prior posts. My experience in this hotel was excellent! CHEAP, CLEAN and with FRIENDLY STAFF. Clean air conditioned rooms, bathroom including amenities (soap, shampoo, lotion), very friendly staff always willing to help you with directions and maps and well located (1 1/2 block away from the nearest tram stop). A grocery store is 1 block away, a couple of restaurants are about 160 feet from the hotel and the Heineken Museum is a short walk distance. This hotel is now part of the Accor chain hotels. Maybe those awful experiences I read in the prior reviews happened before this Mercure Frommer hotel acomplishes the Accor standard. I totally recommend this hotel for young people with a controlled budget.",
            "We booked through Airmiles to stay 2 nights at this hotel. The Airmiles pictures definitely make the hotel look more luxurious than it is in person. The fixtures and furnishings in the bedroom are ready for refurbishment and the bathroom needs a deep clean. The location is ideal for exploring Amsterdam and there are tram links close by. Don't hail a cab unless you can speak Dutch because we were truly ripped off; I don't think the taxi driver realised we had been in Amsterdam for a couple of days and had walked the road numrous times when he took the scenic route and charged us E15 for what should have been a 3km journey. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is good - healthy and fresh with plenty of choice, but don't expect service with a smile. General value for money was about average, I reckon.",
            "Stayed for 4 nights at Arthur Frommer. Room was on 3rd floor, facing over the street, at the front of the hotel. We'd booked a twin, but actually got a room with a large double and a single, so we had lots of room. Very impressed with the cleanliness and standard of housekeeping. The beds were supremely comfortable, and the ensuite, whilst compact, was modern, stylish and featured a large shower, with non-stop hot water and plenty of towels. Having read other reviews of the hotel, I'm surprised that people have complained about the noise. We heard nothing at all from neighbouring rooms, and could only occasionally hear doors closing further down the corridor - certainly nothing to cause a problem. The street is quiet. There is a school/nursery nearby, but the noise is only intermittent during the day, and, to be honest, it's a nice sound anyway. Location is terrific. Tram runs past end of the street but we pretty much walked everywhere. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the Oude Kerk and the same to walk to The Jewish Quarter or the Museum Quarter. You're just a few steps away from some of the prettiest stretches of canal. There's a large supermarket a block away with everything you might need and several cafes/ restaurants within very easy reach. The area felt very safe, even late at night. Reception staff extremely helpful and professional, and speak pretty impeccable English. They helped with directions, booking the airport shuttle etc. Only two downsides. (1) breakfast not inc and charged at approx 18 euros pp per day. We skipped this and got what we needed from the supermarket. (2) no tea tray in room but is offered at a rate of 5 euros a day. I thought this was a bit poor - it surely can't cost much to put a modest hospitality tray in the room and it's nice to be able to get a hot drink when you want it. These are the 2 reasons why i've not scored top marks.",
            "good points - clean, comfortable, many languages spoken by polite & helpful staff. quiet street close to romantic canals and friendly bars bad points breakfast overpriced & slow delivery of request for coffee in room (over 30 mins), room smaller than expected but upgrade was possible. summary - excellent hotel for romantic visit to Amsterdam but consider upgrading orm basic room",
            "This hotel was excellent. In a very quiet street, away from the red light district but still walking distance from all the main attractions. Hotel staff were pleasant. It was an advantage having a 24 hour manned reception desk. Close to breakfast spots, museums and restaurants. Definitely worth the money.",
            "This hotel is a hidden gem in Amsterdam. It is in a secluded courtyard just off one of main roads leading to the Dam Square and Central Station. Most of the main sights are in easy walking distance. The Staff were v friendly and efficient, speaking english as one of their many languages. Booking in was v easy. Our Room was clean and airy, the Bed was v confortable, with a good ensuite wc/shower. Breakfast was of qood qualitiy continental style, the waiting staff were good. Eggs were cooked to order. The reception staff gave us good directions to help get our bearings on our first venture out. They also recommended good restaurants nearby, which we did manage to visit. Only down side to our stay was the lack of compilmentary tea/coffee facilities in the room, but these were available from the reception for a charge. We would stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel to others",
            "We stayed here last year almost same time and came again last weekend for 2 nites. Its 200m from tram stop which takes you in 10 mins to city centre, 200m from mini supermarket for extras and 50m from Mellow Yellow, a great coffee shop...... There is no restaurant in hotel only small bar but several to choose from within 500m. We ate first nite at Les Fles on next canal north about 250m & next nite at authentic indonesian on Utrechstrasse, Tempoe Doeloe which was quite special, about 600m. We find eating out in Amsterdam expensive for food and wine but it is too in Lindon! Its 25m off main road so quiet at nite, stylish with a nice courtyard and nice rooms. The room we had on first stay was on ground (1) floor, last weekend was on 3rd floor so not so grand in attic but still well appointed with Velux window. We did not realise room had air con until 2nd nite when we awoke too hot and switched it on. Only disappointment is that no rooms seem to have bath tubs only showers, and the breakfast is expensive unless you are all inclusive.",
            "Stayed in this wonderful hotel for two nights and couldn't have had a more enjoyable stay. Placed in a charming street, within walking distance of canals, shops and attractions, it was spotlessly clean, with trendy decor, lovely bar & restaurant and staff were very efficient and friendly. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",
            "I stayed here for 2 nights this month. The hotel is on a quiet residential street which is within a 10-15 minute walk from the main shopping areas etc. Rooms are pretty spacious and have a nice bright colour scheme. I was given a room on the 3rd floor which was very cosy and quiet. In fact I didn't see any other guests while I was there at all. Breakfast is served in the basement room, with a wide range of food available and I would recommend it. Although I think it is quite expensive if not included in your rate. The staff are very friendly and have lots of info on what to do in Amsterdam. The only downside of the hotel I could see were that they didn't have anywhere to eat or any room service. There is a restaurant just along the street from the hotel as well as some other places nearby though.",
            "Location: Tucked away from main street, the hotel really feels like part of the neighbourhood. Very quiet and quaint. It's a great location, not too far from anything. Easily accessible from three tram lines, 16, 24, 25. At night, after clubbing, if you don't want to wait for the night bus, you can always walk home as well (since Amsterdam is very compact). I was clubbing in Leidsplein area and walked home in 15-20 mins. In the morning, Every morning, I walked 5-10 mins to Munt-Plein (Flower market) and had breakfast along the canal there. Cleanliness: Very clean and recently remodeled so toilet fixtures, beddings, TV, desk, etc are all in great condition. Room/Computer: I was in 308, their top floor, so I had a slanted roof. I have no problem walking around, but tall people might hit the ceiling. There was a PC in the lobby for everyone to use free of charge. Value: Hotel prices tend to be higher in AMS due to its limited availability. Mercure provides a good balance between value, location, and facility. Overall: Very happy with my stay, a cozy room without that boring hotel feel.",
            "I booked the hotel through flying blue miles for 3 nights for me, my wife and my 16th months' son. Everyone was really very friendly, the rooms are extremely clean and nice, breakfast rich and of very good quality and the area, where the hotel is, very quiet. Also it is located close to the centre of the town and we could reach all the places we were intereseted to visit by foot, which was very important especially considering that we were travelling with a small kid. End of the day we were very happy about it and, in case we are back in Amsterdam, this hotel will be our first choice.",
            "The hotel is very good, the staff very friendly. Location is quite good. Not gobsmacked in the city, but close to all of attractions. We were able to checked in before the say-so checking time, and we were asked whether we would like to leave our luggage after we checked out. The bed is AMAZING, the pillows were so nice, it made me want to throw pillows I have at home and get one that is exactly like the ones at the hotel. TV has zillions of channel (maybe not zillions, but it seems like never ending channels). BUT... I requested when I booked that we would like 1 double bed and 1 single, instead I got 3 singles. When asked how come we got singles bed, they nonchalantly that the particular room has been given away, so O well, what can we do kinda attitude. All good, I'm not fussy. Next, we were advised that wifi is available entire hotel. We didn't get it in our room, maybe because our room was kinda underground, so the wifi doesn't get to our area. The most disturbing part is, when I went to shower, there are A LOT of dead bugs on the floor. It seems that (maybe) the room has been unoccupied for sometime and hasn't been clean again when we get there. Overall a good stay, if only there are no bugs on the bathroom floor...",
            "This is a charming hotel in a great location in the central city. It's walking distance to many things, including the famous museums, and a short tram ride to central station. The rooms are small, but comfortable and clean, and have all the usual amenities, including free wireless internet. I did not try the breakfast, since it was rather expensive (17.50 euro), and there were nice bakeries right around the corner. The staff were helpful and friendly, and made me feel very welcome. I would definitely return to this hotel on my next trip to Amsterdam.",
            "Hotel is situated in a quiet part of the city, about 20 minutes walk from the main tourist areas. It is rather difficult to find because of the narrow one-way streets, but is worth the effort. Overall we had a happy experience, except for a shock on check-out when we were charged 90 euros for two days parking. No mention had been made of this at any time.",
            "We hve just returned from a 2 night trip to Amsterdam staying in this excellent hotel. The hotel couldnt have been better. It was spotless and the staff were so helpful and caring and efficient. The choice of food served at breakfast was first class, and there was something for all tastes. The position was also excellent as all the main places to visit were in walking distance. We would definately revisit and would have no hestitation in recommending it to anyone.",
            "The hotel is in a canal belt and easily walkable to the main attractions - the Heineken Experience, Anne Frank and the Rijks and Van Gogh Museums. Its not in party central, which means quiet nights. Also there is a tram stop nearby on the main road. I had no problems getting around Amsterdam from this base. The reception is currently undergoing renovation, which isn't pretty. Hans checked me in and he was courteous and welcoming. The double room was small, but pretty good value for Amsterdam standards, and the new furnishings were lovely. The walls were painted a dark blue, which may not be to everyone's taste but the look went well with the coloured carpets and decor. Lots of restaurants in the area, and there are cafes, a deli and a bagel shop just around the corner.",
            "Hotels in Amsterdam in Amsterdam expensive! This hotel is a great price for the quality and nice and modern. The 1 euro bus/van hop on hop off that runs around and stops anywhere is very very close to the hotel and well worth using. Hotel also really close to the Heiniken factory!!! Worth staying at.",
            "Rooms are clean and look nice but at about 2-5am the pipe works for the hotels central heating fires up and you hear constant noise in the rooms from radiator pipes (even if the radiator is switched off). We stayed 4 nights and were moved rooms 3 times and all the rooms same problems. If you are a light sleeper like me the hotel is not good. You also hear a lot of noise from other rooms as the walls are thin.",
            "We stayed at the Mercure Amsterdam Arthur Frommer for 3 nights in January 2010. We stayed many times at Accor hotels before (whether Sofitel / Mercure or Novotel) and never had to complain. However, Mercure Amsterdam Arthur Frommer deserves one. It took us 25 minutes to check-in, as the receptionist was being rude to a guest instead of trying to help and confort. This caused the guest to complain even more. She was not kind with any of the following guests, including us. Guests in front of us were Gold members and asked for an upgrade. She replied with a straight rude 'no ugrade, sorry'. We asked for a basic info, she replied she did not know. Rooms are good and modern, positions was excellent, in the middle of some of the nicest canals. At check-out, again, a receptionist, this time a loud man, was rude to a guest that complained about high extra charges. Apparently they charge EUR 20 for parking, EUR 5 for internet., EUR 10 for coffe in the room. Again only 1 receptionist and 6 guests checking out. Some guests wanted lo leave baggages at the hotel for a while. Considering the queue, the receptionist could have collected them, and deposit them later. On the contrary he rudely inticated the way to the guests, left the reception, and went with them to a store room very far away. When he came back, looking quite distressed and upset that the queue was getting longer, he entered a room, to exit after a minute. He kept speaking so loud that everybody could hear all other guests: name, surname, details of nights stayed, minibar, movies watched. In short Agreable hotel, but AWFULLY RUDE reception staff. Will not come back.",
            "The hotel is located quite centrally with being in an overly crowded area. You can get a day pass and hop on the tram that stops really close by and takes you directly to the Dam Square. There are a few cafes and restaurants nearby. Leidepleinssquare is about 5 minutes walk. Actually, everything is quite close on foot. The hotel is nice and clean. Check in was fine and everyone is friendly. The only downside are the very small rooms, which do not leave much room for luggage, while the bathroom is fairly large with quite some unused space. Note that there is a school across the street, so when you get a room facing east, you will hear screaming in the morning. All in all a good value. I would go back.",
            "I stayed in a triple room for two nights. The hotel looks nice and is very well located, most attractions are on walking distance. The breakfast was perfect for me, plenty of healthy choices. The only disadvantage was that the hotel was rather noisy on the second night. There is also no double glass so there might be noise from the street. However, I slept very well because of the great beds!",
            "I have visited this hotel three times in the last two years. Always very clean and quiet, excellent breakfast. Rooms at second and top floor are also extremely charming and big, while the rooms at ground floor are very small and those next to the service entry are noisy. There is no price difference really, so first bookings get the better rooms... Public transport is very close and connects perfectly both directly to the city center and on the circle lines around the city.",
            "We took our two children to Amsterdam for a few days in March and were really pleased with this hotel. It is in a great location - a quiet side street away from hustle and bustle, but within easy walking distance of plenty of things to see & do. The hotel was very clean & the staff very friendly, particularly towards the children (who incidentally loved the artwork in the room). The tv able to receive BBC was an unexpected bonus for the kids. Breakfast was typically European but plenty of it.",
            "This hotel was comfortable, clean, and offered great service. The room was smaller than American hotel rooms, but it was enough space for the two of us and the bathroom was bigger than average. Modern details and fantastic customer service at the front desk made this hotel feel like home during our stay in Amsterdam. It is located on a quiet street a block from a canal and is walkable to major attractions.",
            "We stayed at this hotel May 11-13, 2011. The rooms are modern, clean. The beds are ex excellent. The bathroom excellent. There is no restaurant, and the breakfast is a little pricy - but the staff are most helpful and welcoming. The location is not bad, a little walk or tram ride away from most tourist spots. Highly recommend, would not disappoint.",
            "Just returned from a 2 night stay here. Rooms were small - basically just the bed and no room for much else. The beds themselves were comfortable,however, and the rooms were clean. Two of us had rooms on the ground floor and found the noise from reception annoying - the noise seemed to travel along the corridor so clearly it felt as though someone was right outside your room. Also got woken by a banging noise which seemed to be coming from the heating system or pipes. Staff were helpful, friendly and accommodating which redeems this hotel somewhat. Nice hotel but we wouldn't opt to stay here again.",
            "The location is convenient for sightseeing - you can get any of most interesting places on foot, the staff is very helpful and friendly. Disadvantage - breakfast is very expensive, although there is a variety of good meal and drinks. Walls and doors are not sound protected, so if someone talks loudly in the floor hall you can be disturbed and even woken up.",
            "We visited this hotel in late March, and found it to be really agreable. It is in a perfect location - tram stops are a few minutes walk from it in either direction - to Leidseplein or the Dam and all other tourist attractions in between. Or if the weather is nice (it was freeezing last week) you can easily walk to everywhere. Hotel staff were pleasant and helpful, the room was a decent size, with comfortable beds, tv, mini bar, and large shower room. Breaksfast room/Bar was a decent size. Can't fault the hotel at all really.. would throuoghly recommend as it is very comfortable. In a good location, but also benefits from being in a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle. Would thoroughly recommend. Enjoy your stay.",
            "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. It is in a pretty and peaceful location, but within easy walking distance of restaurants and centre. The rooms were clean and modern, but quite small. It was necessary to pay extra for the tea and coffee facilities by the day, which seemed incredibly mean. The room was clean, the bed was reasonably comfortable. There's a kindergarten just outside so there's a little noise at times but at weekends very quiet. One downside was at about 2-5am the pipes for the hotels central heating fires up and you hear constant noise in the rooms from radiator pipes (even if the radiator is switched off).",
            "I am a Favorite Guest Business program member which had pre-paid our stay but entered the wrong A Club number. When I arrived, I asked to have the discount applied and enter to the correct Business card number. The hotel manager refused to give the program discount. This hotel management has a poor attitude toward the customer and it appears the management at this hotel is just looking for excuses not to give you the discount. This same situation happened to me at another Accor hotel and that hotel manager was more than happy to provide the discount. Beware of typos when enter your A Club loyalty number when booking this hotel.",
            "This hotel is well situated in a quiet street. The building is a restored townhouse, and the room was comfortable and clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Free wi-fi is available and works well. I would recommend this hotel to business travellers and tourists.",
            "Stayed in this hotel for 6 nights on a business trip. The rooms are small but very stylishly decorated and with good modern bathrooms and very comfy beds and pillows. The hotel is situated on a quiet residential street which means you get a good nights sleep. However, you're not far from all the sights and it's a very pleasant stroll along some of the prettiest canals to Rebrandtplein and the city centre. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice and good freshly squeezed orange juice. The hotel bar is pricey, but nice for a drink before heading out of an evening. Staff were very helpful with restaurant recommendations and travel tips. I'll be back!",
            "Good, clean room. Clean hotel. EXCELLENT staff was Incredibly helpful from the beginning of my stay until the end. Free wifi in the lobby and in the room (you can use it on your handheld device and laptop w/same free code unlike some hotels who act like wifi is sacred.....it's 2011 and wifi THROUGHOUT THE HOTEL AND IN THE ROOMS should be free. This hotel understands that!). Room is not huge but not terribly small either. If you want to be a few blocks from the heart of the action this is an excellent choice. You're probably 100 yards from the tram stop, a block or so from a grocery store and even closer to a few pubs and restaurants. I stayed in room 120 (first floor no elevator required). GOOD SELECTION. I will definitely stay here again if I'm in Amsterdam. I was freaked out that it may be a mediocre hotel since people bash hotels for silly reasons, however if you need a nice, clean, reliable hotel in a good location this is your best bet. I'd love for it to have been less expensive but w/the way people talk about cleanliness, mice, etc. in other less expensive hotels there's NO WAY I'd take that risk. Thanks for an awesome stay.",
            "Have just returned from a great stay at this hotel. Arrived early at the hotel and our room was not ready. Reception kindly looked after our luggage whilst we went to explore the area. The hotel is set just off the main city centre but all areas of interest are within walking distance. We were impressed with our room. Very comfortable bed and good shower. Breakfast, which was included in our package price, was exceptional. Freshly squeezed orange juice, cereals, cheeses, hams, pates, fresh fruit, all kinds of fresh bread as well as scrambled eggs and bacon. You could also order freshly cooked fried eggs if you preferred. Being English, I do like tea/coffee facilities in the room which are not provided. However, you could book this facility for 5 Euros a day, which is very good value when a cup of coffee averages 3 Euros in local cafes. Overall, a great stay in a very comfortable hotel with friendly staff. Would definitely stay again if returning to Amsterdam.",
            "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. It is in a pretty and peaceful location, but within easy walking distance of restaurants. The rooms were clean and modern, but quite small. It was necessary to pay extra for the tea and coffee facilities by the day, which seemed incredibly mean. Parking was very expensive, but at least there was some available. We didn't really have any choice but to pay it as the street parking was also expensive and I never saw a spare space. We were told of the charges on arrival, so it wasn't a surprise. We ate breakfast at the hotel on the last morning of our stay. There were two price choices, express which was 8 euros and eaten in the bar or the full breakfast for 16 euros and eaten in the restaurant. I would not say that either of these options were good value for money, but Amsterdam did seem particulalrly expensive compared with others I have visited. In summary, I would recommend the quality of the hotel, but be prepared to pay for it.",
            "great Hotel, good quiet location, easy walking to Rijksmuseum, van gogh and lots of others. good breakfast, lots of buffet food. GOOD location, quietness, rooms layout. BAD No lift at street level, so some stairs to carry suitcases. highly recommended to stay in, will defenately go back.",
            "I stayed at the Mercure Arthur Frommer this summer and the temperature went up to tropical hights. It was hell at night altough they claim to have airconditioning. The barman was smelly and was asking for a tip! Brutally! To make things even worse: the night porter was drunk!! I complained to the manager but she tried to blame me!! Never, never, never stay at this hotel",
            "Our room was on the 3rd floor, and had a sloping roof, affecting one side of the bed making it hard to get in and out. Staff were generally ok, except the cleaning staff who ignored the do-not-disturb sign on our room, and chose to make it up anyway. We didn't want it made up, we wanted out privacy. We were out of the hotel at the time but that's hardly the point. The colour scheme of the room was a sort of lime green and a pinky colour. Sort of odd really. Location-wise, the hotel is in a nice, quiet location that seems very residential. It's close to Leidensplan, with lots and lots of restaurants, things to see and do. It's a bit of a walk from the Red Light district, but you could always get a tram. We were very upset to discover that for the rate we pay for an Accor 4 star-hotel, there was no in-room coffee facilities. A sign in the lift kindly offered it to us for 5EUR a night. That';s not reasonable at a hotel of this level.",
            "What a great hotel. Situated in a very quiet residential street within easy walking distance of most of the major tourist sites in Central Amsterdam. The welcome at reception was very warm and amusing (being told the room was the only one where it is advisable not to be drunk upon entry!). The room was immaculate and very comfortable but a little cold to begin with due to the heating not having been switched on, but this was soon rectified. The bar is very pleasant and spent a very agreeable late Saturday evening in the company of the barman and a Norwegian engineer. The tranquility is marvellous compared to some other Amsterdam city centre hotels I have stayed in. I will definitely use this hotel in future.",
            "I spent 3 nights and is just great. Nice location, in the nicest part of the town with beautiful canals. I took a privileged room are just restored so everything is new and confortable. Very nice decoration, good breakfast. It was all great. Friendly service. 5 min walk to rembrandt plain.",
            "I stayed here for two nights with two girlfriends - they even managed to find us a room with three single beds! Spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated and with staff that really couldn't do enough to assist. The bar was lovely. The beds were really comfortable and although we were at the front of the hotel, we were not disturbed by noise even though we slept with the window open. The hotel is in a lovely quiet spot but within easy walking distance of the canals, shops etc. Our only small negative comment would be that there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room (although available from room service). I would definitely return, as would my friends. A truly welcoming place to rest your head whilst enjoying the beautiful city of Amsterdam.",
            "Amsterdam is a beautiful city, hotel was perfect location, very quiet,wonderful breakfasts, really well managed, its a pleasant walk to all sights, flower market very close. felt very safe, did boat trip and really enjoyed it, gives you a great feel for the city. Alot to do and see, so will definately return.",
            "Spotlessly clean,very comfortable bed and really nice staff.If you stay here you will most likely use the trams a lot so you should get a 24hr pass (7 euro) as it is 2euro60 every time you ride. You can also get a 48hr but you have to go to the station for this. Take a look at the little voucher stand in the lobby as we got discount on a few things with these including the beautiful museum of bags and purses. The bar is very nice and we went there a couple of nights, the staff where very good. Didnt have breakfast as it was 17euro and there are too many other options nearby. We tried the 1euro breakfast at the HEMA store and it really was great value. Apart from an issue with noisy heating we couldn,t fault this hotel .",
            "Just stayed for 3 nights with 6 friends & found the hotel to be better than expacted. Having stayed in a few Mercure hotels (generally on cheap & cheerful breaks) we found the hotel to be better than expected. The staff were friendly, rooms smallish but clean (cleaned every day) & the continental breakfast more than adequate (with exceptional fresh orange juice - a machine squuzed them freshly as required). The location was down a quiet side street but near enough for \"hitting the town\", with good tram links although close enough for walking. One exceptional point was that I managed to leave some cash in the room safe & only remembered after checking out! However, they had it safely kept in reception. It is also near (only 50 yards from) a very good \"local\" steak restaurant Steakhouse Piet de Leeuw.",
            "With Mercure you can be confident of a nice, clean room with free internet and excellent breakfast. There's some construction outside the hotel, which made it a bit noisy (but no fault of the hotel). The site was accomodating and professional. The rooms are good for the rates charged and the furniture is comfortable. English TV is an added bonus. The location is within walking distance of the city centre but situated in a quiet setting, away from the noise and stress of downtown.",
            "Actually I liked the location, on a quiet residencial street, and liked the style of building. But the good part stops here... I hated the room decoration. The first room I occupied had a brown and blue painting, very dark and tight. Never felt so bad in a hotel room. Internet connection didn't worked with cable, and wireless was T-Mobile, wich I could not use because don't had a T-Mobile phone and could not use credit card for paying the service due to company policies. I finished using the desktop PC near the frontdesk... After complaining about internet I tried another room where the connection still didn't worked but I could get free access from a hotspot and the room was better, with more space and \"lighter\" green paint. The building itself is charmy, with the help of a good IT pro for fixing the internet problems and a good decorator or architect to redesign the rooms it can get quite better. At least new carpet and paintings... Meanwhile, I would never get back...",
            "We stayed here for a couple of nights in March 2012. Our room was on the second floor and really quite lovely. Very clean, modern, and stylish. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a huge room, but there was some storage space and a wardrobe, which was ample as there were just the two of us and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have too much luggage. The bed was comfortable and spotless, although a word of warning to anyone who considers themselves to be tall: me and my partner are both on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpetite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 side, but even we found the bed was a bit too short as our toes were hanging over the end of the bed! The bathroom was also really clean and stylish, and the complimentary toiletries were a nice touch. Our room did overlook the building work that was going on next door, so although the view wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wonderful, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disturbed by it in any way. And thankfully, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the problem with noisy pipes that has been reported by other guests! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have breakfast during our stay and so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that, but we did make use of the hotel bar, which was really well designed and has a lovely ambiance. The prices were really reasonable too, compared to other European hotels that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in. All the staff we dealt with were courteous and polite, and more than happy to help us out. We found the location of the hotel to be pretty much perfect for us. It only took about 10 minutes to walk into Dam square in the evenings, yet it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far enough away from the hubbub that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly quiet and peaceful for a city centre hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easily within walking distance of the Rijksmuseum and the Heineken experience, and about a 10 minute tram ride away from Dam Central station and the canal boat piers. So overall, I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a bad word to say about this place! I would recommend it to other travelers as a good base to explore the city, without paying the top prices charged by more centrally based hotels.",
            "We (me, wife and adult daughter) stayed three nights in this hotel in mid-April. We were allocated Room 108 which we suspect normally had two single beds but the management had put in a roll-away bed as well. All the beds were fine and comfortable. Linen was changed for the third night. There were some cobwebs and dust visible on the high picture rail, quite a few marks on the walls (from suitcases?) and grubby paintwork around the light switches. All this made the room look a little worn and shabby. The air conditioner didn't seem to cool the room, just blow air around on what was a temperature record breaking weekend (27C). The clean, bright bathroom was huge with a proper full-size bath tub with over-bath shower. The sink/vanity unit was okay, and the towels were clean, fluffy and changed every day. The free in-room safe was a good asset. The mini-bar was well stocked, but the contents didn't entirely match the printed list. There is no tea/coffee making facility in the room. From previous reviews we elected not to use the expensive hotel breakfast bar but to eat at a small cafe a few hundred meters south of the hotel on the main road - that was fine. The bagel cafe mentioned in reviews looked good. Note that the Persian restaurant (the Teheran) mentioned in previous reviews is now closed and looking very derelict. Staff were helpful in providing maps and calling taxis. Although not in the downtown central area it is generally within walking distance of most tourist sights, and easily accessible using the 16, 24 and 25 trams from/to Centraal Station. The car park is small, max imum 7 or 8 cars. In summary the hotel was perfectly adequate as a place to shower and sleep. We booked through Expedia and paid EUR118 per night (incl taxes). Yes, we'd stay there again.",
            "Stayed 2 nights recently. Hotel in good quiet location easily accessible to most things either on foot or by tram. Rooms nicely refurbished, clean and comfortable although the bed was a bit hard and the room at night was very hot, couldn't really open the window because of noise of people passing by late at night in the courtyard behind our room. We got a good deal which included breakfast which was fine - plenty of choice, but don't expect anything cooked apart from hard boiled eggs. Recommend getting the two day tram pass at the Central Station in the Tourist Information Kiosk and don't panic the queue moves really quickly with their number system! Good idea to go on a guided bus tour first then you can choose which places you want to visit, we ended up missing a couple because we did it on the last day! !",
            "We have just returned from this hotel where we stayed for 5 days. Our room was a bit too small for what we've expected, we kept bumping into furniture around the bed. It was clean, but some things were a bit shabby, like the shower not working well, and the door missing some paint. All in all it was an ok experience. The location is well, some 5 tram stations from the Dam Square, reachable by stroll. Noise in the hotel was a bit of a problem, as well as the window that was a bit old and couldn't close entirely. Staff were ok, but i must point out that the guy working in the bar was extremely rude and unpolite, not wanting to give me a cup of hot water for my medicine at 23:45 saying that he was done with the work (the bar works until midnight) and making all sorts of faces, and gesticulating in a not proper way. We didn't have breakfast so i can't comment on that. Including all, it was a bargain considering the prices in Amsterdam but i really think it could have been much better.",
            "Stayed three nights at the Frommer in September 2011. Being out from the city center and 100+ yards off a busy street, it was amazingly quiet at night. But that 100+ yard walk brought you to a tram stop that could get you into the center in five minutes, and the hotel is closer to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum (and the Cat Museum!) than those nearer the Dam. Breakfast is not cheap at e17.50 but has a great variety, and if you're an early riser, it opens at 6:30. Bed comfy, and what matter more in a hotel. If I return with my wife next year, we will definitely stay here.",
            "Great place to stay, lovely smiley staff, clean rooms, great sleep, no noise at weekends. It is not in the centre of Amsterdam, so consider that if you want to be closer to Dam Square etc. However, it is a short walk from the museums - Gogh etc - and Vondel Park, and is very close to a tram stop on Vijzelstraat that takes you into the city centre proper. We didn't have the breakfast, it seemed pricey to us, but instead ate out every morning.There are several cafes etc nearby and we had breakfast at Vlaamsch Broodhuys, Vijzelstraat 109 - check their website, they sell a huge variety of artisan breads to die for, plus coffees, pastries, croissants, fruit platters etc. We also ate at Myrabelle, Vijzelgracht 1, a lovely pub that does really nice moderately priced food. A great place to stop off at in late afternoon/early evening for an aperitif if you are returning to the hotel. The other place we liked was De Blauwe Hollander, Leidsekruisstraat 28. It serves typical Dutch food at a reasonable price and was packed when we went on Saturday night. It's not fine dining and the food reminded me of British comfort food, which was perhaps why I liked it! It's in the middle of a really lively (in a good way) area.",
            "Fairly quiet location in easily accessed position near Tram routes (less than 5 min walk). Small rooms typical of Amsterdam but spotlessly clean and well appointed. Hotel only does breakfast but this is fresh food, of excellent quality and variety and staff are very attentive and friendly. Do not expect a pool or Spa.",
            "This property was my first stop after an all-night flight. They had a room ready for me at noon when I finally crashed. This property is just about finished with a thorough remodel. My room was great (two single beds is always a surprise to an American!). The bathroom was brand new and clean. The walls and carpet were freshly updated. I would have loved to have stayed here for my entire visit. It's located a block off of a main street, which makes it nice and quiet at night and it's far enough away from the seedy downtown area that you get a feel for the real Amsterdam. A very nice hotel.",
            "I spent two nights at this hotel and I would recommend it for everybody, who wants conquer Amsterdam. The location near Prinsengracht is very good. It's a 15 minutes walk to Dam and Central Station. And there is also a tram station in 3 minutes walking distance. The hotel is cosy, the rooms are very stylish and well appointed. The bathroom is not to big, but enough. The breakfast is adequate to this category of hotel, but a bit expensive (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac 16,50). There are many nice cafes just around the corner where you can get better and cheaper breakfast. The whole hotel as well as the room and bathroom are very clean. The personnel is very friendly and helpful. All in all a very good hotel to a fair price.",
            "Can't believe the two reviews I've just read. Just returned from Mercure Amsterdam (April 04) and it was fine. Staff very courteous, most comfortable large double bed I've ever had in a hotel, clean, etc. Also clean WC and 'wet style' shower. Nice white fluffy towels. Only thing wrong was no tea or coffee making facilities, but they had satellite TV. Hard to find hotel though, when you arrive at airport, train to Amsterdam Central and then Tram 24 or 25. Just ask, ask ask! the natives are friendly. Thoroughly recommended.",
            "Nice hotel, although the decor is a little wild. Nice location, quiet overnight hours. Good restaurants within walking distance. The staff was EXCELLENT. Very professional and courteous. My only complaint is the rooms are tiny. Yet, you could hold a dance in the shower. Why not make the rooms larger? In order to change my mind I had to go out in the hallway...",
            "The hotel is located just south of the centre of Amsterdam and is easily arrived at on Trams 16, 24 or 25 from Centraal station (the stop to get off at is Wetteringcircuit). It appears to be in a very safe area. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the Heineken Experience. The service we received for fantastic. Hans, on the main desk, was particularly helpful. The rooms are cosy but then you are in Amsterdam so you will only be sleeping there. Only two issues with this place - firstly you can only eat in the hotel at Breakfast time - there is no room service or restaurant. The second issue was that Tea and Coffee making facilities are not provided as standard so you are charged \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 per day for a kettle etc.",
            "We found the Mercure because of it's association with Novotel - it exceeded our expectations and was a great value for a family with small children. Great location near the Heineken Experience, beautiful and spacious room, very helpful staff. It's very hard to find a single room for 2 adults and 2 children, but they can accomodate with advanced notice. We made reservations online and got an awesome rate, but didn't know if they'd have a room for 4 until we arrived. Fortunately, a room with 4 twins was open. There was plenty of space, even with all those beds! Breakfast was filling, although their regular dining room was under construction. The only down side was the street noise from below - but that just helped us get up earlier and get on our way.",
            "I chose this hotel because of its location. The staff is polite and helpful, they made sure to make feel wellcome. A thoughtful detail of the hotel also is give a password to the wi-fi with the expiration only in chekout day, don't forcing the gess to every day ask another password. There is a computer and a printer in the louge (the use is free). My room (208) was spacious and clean, the special pillow (3 per person) and the bed were very confortable. The shower has a constant temperature but whitout much pression, just normal, And had no door, so it left the bathroom a little wet. The place is quiet and near every interesting points includ from the train station. from less them 2 blocks you can find a pub, a mini market, a restaurant and a coffshop. the hotel also has a park in open space.",
            "They took a Merc ure chain property and droped in in a quiet, side street location, differentiated it with modern quirky furniture, and created a great hotel experience. If it weren't for the small Mercure Hotel sign, you wouldn't even know the hotel was there. Walking distance to Heineken Experience, Albert Cruyp Market, Museuamplein, and you can walk to Dam Square in about 20 min (or take the 24 tram). Staff pleasant, and I was promplty checked in to a double on the third floor. Room had modern conveniences, including large bath, fridge, flat screen with international channels, and a windw with shutters. Several wifi options are available, with the cheapest being the broadband connection at the desk for 9 euro per 24 hours. There's a small bar downstaris, and a breakfast room which is simple, but ample.",
            "Why do the advertise with a/c when they switch it off at eleven in the evening? When I complained to the night-receptionist I could't understand a word he was saying. I think he comes from Pakistan or something. The general manager did't listen to my complaint she was more interested in her ugly little dog.",
            "The hotel was within walking distance of the whole city; we didn't have to travel by tram except for our arrival and departure. The bed was extremely comfy, the staff very friendly and helpful, the breakfast plentiful (included in our deal), the room small but more than adequate. It was freezing in the city (the canals froze over for the first time in 15 years) but the room was warm and cosy - we didn't experience any of the radiator noises that some other guests mentioned. The bar was a really welcome spot after a day or night out. The wines were very reasonably priced, the staff extremely friendly and the atmosphere very relaxing. Our room backed onto the street where the school/kindergarten was, yet this was absolutely not a problem. The kids started making a noise around 9 am, by which point we were up and about, getting ready for breakfast. Even if we'd been lying in, the kids wouldn't have disturbed us - the noise was very much of a background nature. All in all, I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel to family and friends with no qualms."

            "This was our first trip to Barcelona and the last leg of our Europe trip. My husband and I didn't have a large budget so we opted to stay outside of the main tourist area in order to get a better rate for our 4 night stay. This hotel is what I would say on the edge of the tourist area but still definitely in walking distance to all of the sightseeing. It is located about a 10 min walk to the main areas and about a 15-20 min walk down to Las Ramblas, etc. We even walked down to the beach, which wasn't bad at all! But we like to travel by foot to take in the culture. :) To get here we took the train and metro and it was very very easy and inexpensive. To leave we opted for the taxi service because our flight was at 6am. Both great options for to and from the airport. The front desk is very helpful and there 24/7. The rooms and lobby are very clean and modernly updated. The halls are very quiet, which is great for long days of being out and about. The hotel is very safe and there were absolutely no signs of theft. Our room itself was HUGE - king bed, couch, desk, big dressing area, huge bathroom. It was great for the last part of our trip! I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are look for a dependable less expensive place to stay.",
            "Recently renovated hotel. Well done. Good reception, atmosphere. Excellent, very friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast. Overall very positive impression. We had a triple room. Unfortunately the triple rooms face an internal courtyard which is covered. So no fresh air circulation. With all our systems off, we at one moment had an internal room temperature of 29 degrees. So, in the midst of winter, we switched on the Airco. Call me a complainer, but I do not like sleeping with Airco either. So, if you like to sleep in a warm room, do go there.",
            "Booked U232 Hotel as part of an Expedia air/hotel package not knowing what the hotel would be like. Had read the reviews which sounded good. Without reservation I can now highly recommend the U232. We had 3 rooms on the 2nd floor. Each room had a different layout but each one was finely appointed, exceptionally clean, with great storage for your bags, free wi fi, and one of the best bathrooms of all the hotels we stayed in over 14 days. The front staff were always extra friendly and helpful in recommending restaurants or places to visit. Bedding was comfortable as well. The hotel is located in an upscale neighborhood and within a very short walk of the nearest metro station. Rooms were quiet even from the hospital nearby never disturbing us with loud ambulance sirens or street noise. From our balcony we could view the nice college campus across the street. Would certainly stay here again.",
            "My wife and I stayed at the U232 for 5 nights while we were on holiday in Spain. Location - The hotel is located on the western perimeter of the Eixample district, very close to the Diagonal (a street that runs diagonally through Barcelona). The location, though not in the main tourist area, served us quite well during. The \"Hospital Clinic\" metro stop is about 100 meters from the hotel, so when we didn't want to walk somewhere, we were able to get around very easily. It wasn't always easy to find good restaurants in the area, however, so we ate elsewhere in the city on a couple of occasions. Room - Our room was very clean and a reasonable size. We certainly didn't feel that it was too small for our five-night stay. There was also ample room to put away our clothes for the duration of our stay. The washroom was nice despite a small amount of water vapor damage that was visible on the ceiling (I don't know why they don't use bathroom fans in Spain, but that would likely take care of the issue). The shower head produced an absolutely amazing \"rainfall\" shower. I had some trouble with the AC controls, it seemed that the choice was either on or off. Our room was in the back of the hotel and was very quiet. Service - The service from the hotel staff was good. They always had time to answer our questions or make recommendations. The hotel also provides its guests with free high-speed internet. Overall, we'd recommend the U232. We had booked this hotel well in advance and got a good early-booking rate for our room. Any rate you can get under 130 euros per night (breakfast not included) during the peak tourist season should be considered a bargain.",
            "Stayed at this hotel for 4 days with two other couples before taking cruise. Was very pleased with this hotel, it was better than expected for the price. Each of our rooms were different, all totally adequate, very clean and modern. Excellent air conditioning system and none of us heard a noise at night.Our room had two bathrooms which was completely unexpected, one with tub, 2nd with shower. Both completely done in tile and dark marble, really modern and chic. The front desk staff were all excellent and very helpful regarding sites, restaurants and general enquiries. Our room included breakfast buffet, we all enjoyed it daily, lots of selection and good quality of foods. Don't know if it would be worth the 14 euro if it wasn't included but it is definately a good addition when included. The front desk staff put us on to one nearby restaurant that we tried. It was called Maitea and is just two blocks away on Casanova Street, an easy 5 minute walk. We took the recomendation and tried the place about 9:00 PM one night. What a great place!!!! We all had a great time in the atmosphere. The owner, Nickolas was a great guy and very helpful. He spoke great English and we had a great meal with wines there. They specialize in Montaditos. These are small pices of breads with different toppings, some hot, some cold. All are unique and many were truly amazing.They keep coming with different plates and recipes of these and one can sample whatever you like. Very reasonably priced and a great local atmosphere may it a highlite for us as an eatery. The hotel staff have cards with directions if you're interested, ENJOY....... We all would definately return to this hotel and will recommend it to our friends who plan to travel to this great city..............",
            "Clean, modern, comfortable. Good location...easy to get on metro and just a couple stops to all tourist areas. Nice staff. Free internet. Great price and value!! Would definitely recommend to all and would stay again myself for sure. Loved it!! This was the first 3 days of a girls trip through Spain with friends, and this was our favorite hotel of the trip.",
            "I like the hotel, but you have to ask for a room with a window on the outside, otherwise you will be disapointed. But if you choose the hotel only for sleeping in a very clean and very nice room, you don't need for a window, chhose this hotel !",
            "After LONG flights from Seattle ~ we were immediately soothed by the friendly and helpful staff allowing us to store our luggage in a secure room so that we could get out for a walk-about to shake off our jet lag. We found every amenity to be 'spot-on' and the location just perfect for us. We enjoyed the buzzing activity from our balcony but our friends said their room facing the back was very quiet compared to ours. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with them again and recommend them to friends wanting an intimate, friendly hotel.",
            "We have just returned from the lovely U232 hotel in Barcelona after a four day break in this beautiful city.Ideally situated for the major sights and a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city.Whilst there we suffered an unfortunate experience while out one evening and the hotel staff, particularly Manuel pesich,went out of their way to help us.Their kindness and understanding is something we will never forget.We would recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to return one day soon.",
            "This hotel may be a little out of the way but it is still close to everything. Our room was amazing, especially for the price. It had a wonderful bar which was appreciated after a hot and busy day sightseeing. Would definitely recommend thi shotle.",
            "The hotel was a great value. It was well located, a few minutes walk to the diagonal. The hotel rooms were clean, not too small, beds were comfortable, nice bathroom. The hotel was lobby was modern in design. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The staff added to the entire great experience we had staying at the hotel. Parking is conveniently located next to the hotel, and the hotel offers a discount on the parking fees. Many nice options for all dining experiences within easy walking distance. I would stay here again.",
            "Pretty good location, just slightly out of the centre. Which, actually is quite handy as a lot of Barcelonas tourist locations are spread out to all parts of the city and this hotel has a metro stop pretty near by. I've stayed here on more than a few occasions now and have always taken the 'top rooms' (as they are referred to by the hotel). They have beautiful terraces and the most amazing enormous 'roman style' marble baths. (absolutely perfect for romance etc...). Apart from these rooms, the hotel is typical of Barcelona. Breakfast is NOT included, despite the exorbitant price and the service is adequate.",
            "We love this hotel! When we were deciding where to stay, we thought U232 might be a bit too far away from everything we wanted to see (we are very active sight seers!!!). Don't let this be a factor because the hotel is in a perfect location! It's in a quiet area, but with very easy access to all parts of town due to close proximity to the subway (very safe). My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights after ending a 12 day cruise. Our first visit to Barcelona. Friends had stayed here and they highly recommended it. We are so happy we listened to them! Our room (#908) was large, very modern, clean and just lovely. Great air conditioning system. The large bathroom was done in beautiful black marble, and had a huge tub next to windows that opened onto a very large private balcony (of course, you could also access the balcony from the sliding glass window in the bedroom!). The staff was outstanding! Very helpful in explaining how to get to places and tips on what to do and best times to do it. And they helped us get the 3:00 a.m. taxi ride to the airport! Good computers/printers downstairs that guests may use for free. We will be going back to Barcelona, and will again stay at Hotel U232.",
            "We liked this, small, modern hotel very much. The desk staff was great, spoke english well, very helpful with directions and suggestions. Our room was spotless and comfortable,, although it looked out only onto an air shaft (no view, but very quiet). We didn't get the breakfast, but the lobby bar was very nice. Separate room with two free internet terminals and printer was great.",
            "We stayed for one night as apart of a stop over in Barcelona. Its about a 20min walk from the city centre but very near to the Hospital metro station from which is fast to get anywhere. We parked in the public carpark under the hotel that was about EUR 20 for 24 hours after a hotel discount. The hotel is quite modern and well decorated in dark wood. Our room was a standard one but was well decorated a of a good size and had a nice bathroom. Everything was very clean. We did not have breakfast as our rate did not include it and it was quite expensive but there are a number of local cafes and coffee shops so getting breakfast and lunch was no problem. The area felt safe. I would be happy to stay again on my next visit. It was a very peaceful experience compared to the crowded city.",
            "i stayed here for just one night to see FC Barcelona with my 6 yr old son. The hotel is a short walk to the metro stop, by short i mean less than a minute !! Staff here (2 ladies on the daytime shift) were absolutely superb and so helpful. The room was nice and there is an excellent toiletries/ grooming kit provided so you need nothing - not even a toothbrush !! The only negative point i can say is that i had a room facing inward so there was little natural light. Beds were soft and comfy - overall a very pleasant stay for less that \u00a365 ! !",
            "We recently stayed in this hotel in Barcelona, based on the Tripadvisor reviews we thought it would be fantastic and i have to admit we were very dissappointed. The staff we found were quite cold and non welcoming. In terms of the hotel, yes it is a business hotel and therefore lacked in terms of facilities if your trip is for leisure, there is no area to relax in the sun or terrace area, even the balconies didn't have chairs. Beware also breakfast is \u20ac27 for two people and a whiskey and coke at the bar \u20ac12, so this hotel is very over priced. Down the street we found a little cafe where a beer was \u20ac1.90 to put things in context. Oh and the bar shuts at 11pm - even for residents The hotel is a good 25 minute walk into Las Ramblas although the metro is fantastic if you don't mind getting two trains, however if you want to be in the centre of things, this hotel is far. On the positive side the beds were very comfortable and the hotel is quiet. wish we had more good things to say as we usually book on the advice from tripadvisor, but not this time",
            "I stayed in this hotel for 6 night at the beginning of august, one day i did find a bed bug crawling in between the 2 single beds... i didnt know what it was at the time, when i came back home i woke up with at least 100 bites all over my body... i went to the hopsital and the doctor told me that i have been beaten by bed bugs.... i had to stay at the hospital for some injection... and i am totally traumatised..... so obviously i will never go back to this hotel. I have just called the hotel and they just told me \"thanks for acalling\" thats it.... i am sorry but this is not enough..... i am very upset and disapointed....",
            "My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel 5 nights and we really had a pleasant time! The hotel itself looks really nice and comfortable. The room was really nice decorated, but maybe a little bit too dark for my taste. The bathroom has a little rain shower and provide you with all the amenities you need. The staff was friendly and helpfull. The bar is nice, but really expensive. The location was good too. In walking distance are a lot of restaurants, bars and clubs. The subway - which will bring you to the centre, the harbor etc. - is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. A cab ride to the airport will cost you about \u20ac 40,-.",
            "The hotel isnt in the heart of the main touristy areas, but in a nice quiet part of Barcelona - within walking distance of everything - an easy 5-10 minute walk to the main road where the \"hop-on\" tours stops and a short distance from bus # 59. The decor is contemporary with dark colors, cocktail bar in the front entrance. Easy jazz music playing softly throughout. Super fast free internet with a printer. Rooms were very modern. The place was immaculately clean. The staff were very pleasant, extremely friendly and obliging, helpful with directions, recommendations and other needs. Multilingual so I did not have to embarrass myself trying to speak Spanish. Restaurants, shops, cafes and supermarkets all nearby. From the service, to the room to the location, I could not fault the U232. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.",
            "We slept one night for business. The hotel has a nice trendy moderne atmosphere that is very cosy ( wood, dark colors on the walls). Room very nice with flat screen, great bedding, free internet ( VPN not compatible) Price was 110\u20ac including breakfast ( fresh orange juice) Minibar filled and not too expensive. Location is maybe not the best, but still in a busy area with good restaurants around Would go back - definitively",
            "My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in September. This hotel is less expensive than most since its in a quiter part of the city. Although its only a 10-20 min walk to most sites. The staff is helpful and the rooms are clean. The bathroom was excellent and appears to have been recently renovated. There is free WIFI. We didn't pay extra for the breakfast but there are plenty of places to eat in the area. Overall we would recommend saving your money by staying at the U232 rather than pay extra just to be a liitle closer to the city center (Barcelona is an easy city to walk around).",
            "This is a wonderful NN hotel which provides great value for the price. We were able to stay in one of the rooms on the top floor which was amazing. There is a large king size bed with a HUGE washroom complete with a jetted tub and two rain showers. The room also has a large patio with a table for dining and lounging. The only downside to this hotel is the location. Although it is still quite central, it is a little bit out of the way. This is easily overlooked though if you can get one of those top rooms.",
            "you have a separate room for your loggage and clothes. good location for shopping.dont waste time for shoping in the city center. close to the hotel there is a big shopping mall and so you can find many other shop in same street. car parking is not free and there is not any elevator from parking to the hotel",
            "hotel is located in very nice area. Not crowded, but 1 minute from metro station L5 and about 15 minutes from La Rambla street. Very friendly staff, good service, rooms exactly as on pictures. Reasonable price. Breakfast is impressive. Good choice of dishes in nice decorated place. Highly recommended. Free internet access.",
            "The hotel is very nice and well placed in the center of the city but the triple rooms have no view, are very cleistofobic and the price is very high for such a case.When we booked the room (by web bookiing) there was no indication that triple rooms are only interior ones.",
            "We spent two days in Barcelona and wanted a hotel near the hop- hop-off Bus Touristic. The hotel is a short walk from stops for both bus routes and close to the metro, very convenient and very comfortable. It is not in a tourist area and so we got a better price and a nicer room for our money. The hotel helped make our too brief visit a pleasure.",
            "We seem to have different priorities than many visitors to Barcelona -- we explicitly wanted to stay in the Eixample, and be near to the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia. We were following the Ruta del Modernisme guide book, and were interested primarily in the works of Gaudi, Domenech i Montaner, and Puig i Cadafalch. However, if you're looking to spend time in the Barri Gothic or visit the waterfront, expect a 12 euro cab ride. The metro, however, is right around the corner and easily accessible. We did not have the breakfast, although there are at least 6 bakeries within a block of the hotel, so if it's unappealing to you, many things around the area should suit better. The gentleman working reception when we arrived was a bit reticent and uncongenial, and after quite a bit of travel, this was unfortunate. For instance, one of our keys didn't work in the door, and we didn't discover until two days later that it had been coded for a different room. Once we were able to enter, however, we were unable to turn on any lights. If it's common to have to use one's room key to turn on the lights in hotels, I have somehow yet to have encountered it, and it would have been nice had the gentleman at reception told us about this detail. So, if you stay at this hotel: your room key turns on the lights, and it must remain in the light lock for the entire time you expect the lights to be operational. However, the woman at the desk in the evening was friendly and helpful, and even helped us a bit with both Spanish and Catalan pronunciation. The woman tending the bar is certainly at home in the chic design boutique hotel environment, and mixes excellent drinks. And when my husband fell under the weather with allergies (which are apparently uncommon in Barcelona), she was sympathetic, and helpfully attempted hot-toddies to soothe his throat, though she was unfamiliar with the practice.",
            "We loved u232. From the very start till we left the staff could not have been more polite and helpful. The welcome drink was our best cocktail in Spain in their very chic little bar. The rooms were so comfortable, the breakfast was tasty and fresh, and the location was brilliant if you don't mind using the metro. We did walk to the wharf on the first day but after that used the nearby subway for easy access to everything Barcelona. We loved our dinner at local pizza restaurant and went to a tourist flamenco performance which was good fun and not too expensive for the show and a simple meal for 25\u20ac. Best was wandering the streets and being gobsmacked by the incredible buildings. Of courseLa Segrada Familia was mind blowing and well worth the entry fee.",
            "Excellent place to stay on a lovely trip to Barcelona. Rate didn't include breakfast and we didn't really speak to the staff so can't comment on this but everything else was excellent. Gusto's by the metro is a great place for a pizza, eat in or out.",
            "First Impression: verry Nice. We travelled to Barcelona for Vacation. For us as Students a verry nice designed Hotel. The staff was verry helpfull. They try to arrange everything or you of you want. We did not use any meals. Supermarket is arround the Corner. Nice Central location. Metro 1 bloc away, Sagrada 20min walk. Free use of 2 computers in lobby with connection to internet and possibility to Print",
            "We stayed at the U232 prior to a Mediterranean Cruise. We spent two nights in the hotel. It was extremely clean and the staff was very helpful. We were greated by Manuel and he made must feel very welcome. The staff that we came in contact with spoke very good English. The room was very nice and the bed was very comfortable. We felt that it was good value for your money. If you are a traveller from North America, I would recommend that you pack a couple of facecloths because they are not available in many European hotels - that is the case in this hotel. We did not find any really good restaurants in the immediate area but just around the corner there is a grocery store where you can pick up a lot of snack foods at a reasonable price. We returned to the hotel for one night prior to our return flight to Canada and had another nice room. It faced the main street so it was not quite as quiet as our first room that faced a courtyard. both rooms were a nice size and bright. Ferran was very helpful in assisting us to confirm our flights home when we were not able to access the sites on the computer. All in all, we were very pleased with the personnel and the rooms.",
            "U232 is classy, clean, and centrally located. It is very stylish, yet completely affordable. The room I was in might have been TOO comfortable. The beds were amazing and every day I woke up to the sun shining in through the door to our balcony, which overlooked the beautiful tree-lined street. The staff is very nice and friendly, and the little bar is a nice touch. My friend and I would grab a drink and olives at the hotel before heading out at night. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby, and you can walk to some of the main attractions in Barcelona. Additionally, the metro is about a two minute walk from the hotel. I would definitely stay here again.",
            "lovely helpful staff and a great breakfast at a reasonable price - a boutique - ish feel , well appointed rooms with huge beds and lovely bathroom. The bar is small and friendly and not intimidating to sit and wait alone in - and the reception staff are very obliging, Clean, freshly done up and classy - recommended",
            "I would stay here again. It is in a great location for a great price and very clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is free wifi. The bar is nice, and on the second floor there is a cute lounge area as well. Yes, the furniture is somewhat cheap, but modern decor at an affordable price is going to mean cheap Ikea-style furniture. The only real downsides were that the shower and sink were very slow to drain and the shower head was so strange it was hard to actually get the water on your body instead of hitting the front wall of the shower. Otherwise, this was a great hotel. There is a nice closet and ample drawer space, and also a desk and side chair. It's not a big room, but if you're in Barcelona staying in your room then you should go home anyway! If you stay here, you MUST go to Maitea for tapas! It's only two blocks away and AWESOME!",
            "U232 is in a residential area of Barcelona. There are good cafes nearby for lunch and breakfast & I don't think breakfast is of good value in U232 (14 euros per person). Hotel rooms were good, bathrooms were very nice. No tea & coffee making facility and there is no provision of kettle, etc. Reception staff was brilliant. Hotel is well connected with public transport therefore you can go out late in the night. Would stay again!",
            "We stayed at Hotel U232 for three nights in July. I had been a little concerned about the hotel being located away from many of the tourist sites but the hotel\u2019s close proximity to the Hospital Clinic Metro stop really makes it a non-issue. We checked in very late in the evening as our train from Pamplona did not arrive until close to 10pm. The gentleman at reception gave us a few restaurant recommendations for restos close to the hotel (there are many). The one thing I appreciated the most from check-in was being told how to get in contact with the front desk (dial 55). At both of our hotels in Madrid and Pamplona, no instructions were given for dialing the front desk and it was difficult trying to figure it out. The room d\u00e9cor was everything it appeared to be online. The bathroom had a little wear and tear but there was ample room for toiletries around the sink. Unfortunately, we were not able to access the free wifi from our room (#405). There is a business center downstairs with two computers and one printer, which would come in handy if you wanted to print out your boarding passes. I would not hesitate to recommend Hotel U232 to friends and I would absolutely stay here again.",
            "We stayed for 5 nights taking into account the Spanish workers strike last month and had a great time there. U232 is a great little boutique hotel with excellent service and the quality of furnishings and detail is extremely good for the price. If you're looking for a more personal service than the larger chains in the city, then this hotel is defintely worth a look. I'd advise to ask in advance to get a room overlooking the comte d'urgell rather than the dark courtyard. Guests ranged from business types to affluent Americans, so peace and quiet is pretty much guaranteed. Location is absolutely fine as its only a 20 min stroll to Las Ramblas - and who'd want to be too close to the equivalent of Leicester Square anyway?! The Eixample district is clearly affluent with many cafes, bars and restaurants nearby so take a good look around. All the staff are very helpful and speak excellent English if your Spanish is a bit ropey. The only thing it lacked was an iPod docking station in the rooms, nothing more. If you want a quality hotel in Barcelona, but don't want to break the bank then book into U232. Highly recommended.",
            "Stayed here last month dor 3 days as I was inBarcelona for a business trip.My room was nice bit dark as it was on th backside therefore it was very quite though.I used some room service reasonaly priced and fast delivery.Reception was the ladies were very kind the guy could was ok. Location is great very close to the metro because of that to all the sites in Barcelona. Would stay again here.",
            "Just returned from a 3 night stay at the U232 and it was wonderful, nothing to fault at all. The hotel is exactly as the website photos show. The lobby area is lovely and relaxing, especially with the ambient music playing. The decor is very clean cut and contemporary and the hotel was only refurbished last year so still has that new smell about it! The staff are very helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious, spotless and you're guaranteed a good nights sleep in the huge comfy beds. Great location and close to the metro station. Check out an amazing tapas bar in walking distance called Cerveseria Catalonia for the best tapas in town. We had 3 glasses of red wine, 5 beers and all the tapas we could fit into 2.5 hours which cost around 50 euros, a bargain for the quality of the food. An excellent hotel, I would definitley go back.",
            "i have just return from a 4 days trip to Barcelona and i was looking forward to write this review. I booked this hotel based on the reviews i have read and because it wasn't in the center of the city near to touristic areas and to be honest the hotel was the best choice of this trip. It is in a quiet area, near the metro station, a few good restaurants and bars are in the area where you can find only spanish people and not tourists. The staff can make you any resrvation for a restaurant or help you accordingly. The first impression when i arrived it was a cosy entrance and friendly staff (well done Manuel) the room was OK for single use (comfortable bed and pillows - clean - mini bar - big flat TV) and it was really quiet even it was near the elevator. The bathroom was clean and it had everything you may needed (the only thing missing in order to make it perfect was a pair of slippers), the shower was big and in marble. The breakfast was excellent, fresh fruits, a lot of choices and traditional mediterranean breakfast. The staff was also very helpful and kind. In the hotel there is free wi-fi connection so you can be online most of the time. if you decided to book a room there, note that you can negociate for the price. I made the reservation on November and when i contacted them by email, they gave me -10% on the internet rate + -10% for early booking. Certainly i return back in U232 for a 2nd visit!",
            "Stayed here for 5 nights and the room is great with two twin beds and two bathrooms, truly a luxury for how much we pay for. One downside is the room has a window facing inside and is dark in the morning that didn't bother us. It is very closed to Metro and great cafe for a quick breakfast. The receptionists are very friendly and knowledgeable. We will come back again and stay here.",
            "We enjoyed the peace and quiet of this hotel. Free internet/computer in their small business center. Requested and received very quiet room facing back. No view, but, more importantly, no noise. Attractive, very clean, smart looking. Hotel stored our luggage for a day before we officially checked-in. Located a bit too far from Las Ramblas to make the walk all of the time, but metro is a block away; most often it required a connection to our destination. About 1.5 blocks to food market, smaller version of La Boqueria. Definitely recommend if you don't mind being a tad away from the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas. For us, that was a plus.",
            "U232 doesn't look like much from the outside, but the unassuming exterior belies an absolutely polished, well-kept interior. We had a room with a small balcony onto the main street (Comte Urgell), but the glass door was remarkably soundproof. That combined with the blackout curtains made for very restful sleep. The room was very, very small, but tastefully appointed and didn't actually feel very cramped. The only thing that was a little strange was the shower. All black marble, which is very nice, but there's no light inside the shower, and there is this funny little window that opens into nothingness (an alternate universe? the twilight zone? some kind of ventilation shaft?). It would be nice if there was a bit more light in the shower, but other than that, a very nice (but tiny) bathroom. This hotel could be improved by offering a free breakfast. We decided to not pay the ~14 euro each day for the breakfast buffet, which looked decent, but not remarkable. Other hotels of this standard that we've stayed out throughout europe offer rooms for a similar price, but include breakfast. This seems like an easy thing U232 could do to improve its attractiveness to all travelers. Finally, it's in a great neighbourhood- slightly out of the main downtown bustle, but with LOTS of amazing restaurant options nearby (though look those up in a guidebook - the ones the front desk suggested were rather underwhelming - the ones suggested in the Time Out guide were especially great).",
            "we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights if you want a room away from the road then ask to be on the back of the hotel very very quiet ,very helpful and speedy at reception, a 5 min walk from the metro station and a 15 min walk from the aerobus which costs about 5euros each to and from the airport or 25 to 30 euros in a taxi, we didnt eat at the hotel for breakfast turn right outside the hotel and 2 doors away is pans (a bit like subway) they sell bagettes for 3.50 euros and you can sit outside in the sun, we didnt walk to las ramblas but i should think its quite a distance on foot ,well situated for the metro to fc barcelona ,would definatly stay again",
            "We were a bit worried about the distance of this hotel from the main tourist areas, but this turned out to be a blessing as we really enjoyed the neighborhood and the hotel itself was top-notch. Our room was on the 2nd floor and faced the back so we didn't have a view - but we did get an extra big balcony. Curiously, there was no patio furniture, so there was no way to really enjoy it other than lean out. This is a very design-y hotel with really nice furniture by Zanotta, Artemide, etc. There's a bar downstairs and a breakfast restaurant (though we opted for neighborhood cafe's instead). If you are taking the metro from the airport, the light blue line actually takes you to the nearest stop (Hospital Clinic). This same line takes you directly to the Sagrada Familia. All other sites are 2-3 transfers away. Friendly staff and great amenities as well (love the heated towel rack and box of personal grooming kit you get upon check-in.)",
            "We booked a \"Top\" room at the U232 (as part of a trip celebrating our wedding anniversary) based on the photos displayed on the hotel website. We expected our room to have a shaded terrace with cushioned chaise lounges as displayed in the advertising for this type of room. While we were given a room on the upper floor, our terrace was open to the elements and was furnished with two canvas deck chairs and did not even offer an umbrella for shade. The temperature was in the 85 - 90 degree range and the terrace was so hot we could not use it at all. We asked to be relocated but were told it was not possible. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, the location was quiet yet accessible to all tourist sites and the metro, and the breakfast was very nice. However we were very disappointed that our TOP room was not what was advertised and not what we expected despite paying the higher rate.",
            "Good, clean, comfortable hotel away from La Rambla. Only a five minute bus ride into the busy Barcelona city. Close to some really lovely restaurants/ tapas bars etc. Staff were really helpful and friendly. Our room was upgraded so we ended up with a suite which was just what we needed after three weeks travelling by car around Italy and France. Breakfast buffet had a wide selection to suite all the different types of international travellers.",
            "I stayed at the U232 for a trip with my friend ,arrived early and got allocated our room straight away.room was lovely with everything you would need,all toiletries and proper hair dryer.we booked for b&b and the breakfast was great .everything you want to set you up for a day of sight seeing.staff were very friendly and spoke good english, and hotel had a nice relaxed and safe atmosphere to it.would definately stay again.",
            "When traveling to Barcelona, we were expecting a pint sized hotel room because thats what you typically experience throughout Europe. When we arrived at U232 we are pleasantly surprised and the size, decor and cleanliness of the room. Had a large King Bed, large bathroom with all the amenities, Ikea-esque decor, flat panel television and tons of storage for baggage. To top it off they have a free business center with computers and printers. The staff was also extremely helpful, they spoke english (which is pretty hard to find in Barcelona) so they made numerous phone calls for us (ordered us pizza, called the post office for shipping, etc). It was close enough to the shopping line and Las Ramblas to walk and had a great little cafe kitty-corner from it for coffee or pastries. We loved this place and would definitely stay again if we went back to Barcelona! !",
            "We had a wonderful experience at U232. The front desk staff, especially Laia, were great. The room was wonderfully designed, comfortable, and spacious. We were only a block and a half from a metro stop. The only slight concern is that it's not located in the city center, but with the metro so close, it's easy to get around.",
            "The U232 was modern, clean, and comfortable, although the rooms were small by American standards. The free Wi-Fi was spotty, and the shower temperature was tempermental. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. Look for special rates that include the breakfast! It's close to the Metro, but nothing else! If you want to go to Placa Catalunya, it is quite a trip. Recommend taking the (cheap!) taxis if you are in a group. We didn't find many places to eat, shop, or sightsee within walking distance.",
            "Lovely rooms, great location but the staff was a bit unflexible as we had to check out at 12.00h not even 3 minutes later (the hotel hall was empty so no big group waiting for rooms to be cleaned). I wasn't asking for an hour extra but a few minutes to finish packing.",
            "Everything you want from a hotel stay. The room cannot be faulted, with a spacious terrace, super comfy bed and the best hotel bathroom (two rain-showers and bath) and stylish decor. Our favorite part was the excellent service. No sucking up or insincere 'hospitality' just good old honest professionalism and friendly personalities. Absolutely worth every cent.",
            "Great hotel room spec - very friendly welcome from staff who are not only helpful but knowledgable about the area and amenities.We stayed for 3 nights in a U232 room with an enormous super king size bed and private terrace. Quiet outlook at the rear of the hotel away from the main road. Breakfast was plentiful and varied catering for most needs. Unable to fault anything about the hotel and the service we received and highly recommend a stay here.",
            "Great hotel , very close to metro or only 10-15 mins walk away to main tourist areas. Rooms were of good quality and very clean. Service was excellent with friendly helpful staff. In business area but did have a few good restaurants nearby with lots of cafes for breakfast. Pleasant bar in hotel for early evening beer. Didn't eat in hotel so can't comment on food. Rooms were quiet so had good nights sleep. Definitely recommend especially when rates were so good.",
            "We stayed two nights before and two nights after a Royal Caribbean cruise. Being centrally located it allowed us to walk to many places; public systems within a few blocks. The hotel is relatively small, recently updated with adequately sized rooms (very nice bathroom), efficient personnel. Bar is excellent, Breakfast a bit pricey at 13 Euros but good. A number of small resturants are nearby.",
            "We stayed here during peak season, and at under 200 quid for 4 nights the price is fantastic for central Barcelona. Anywhere nearer to La Ramblas at that time of year costs an arm and a leg! It's a short walk to the tube station, a couple of stops and you are at La Ramblas. Tubes run til quite late, but after that taxis back to the hotel are reasonable. The room was nice - nice bed, good size bathroom and mini bar restocked every day (drinks not included) . Would definately stay here again next time.",
            "I really enjoyed staying in the U232 hotel. It was modern and cean. The staff were very helpful and the rooms were a good size and nicely decorated with black beams on the ceiling and a well equipped black marble bathroom (once you work out how to use the shower controls - one for water and one for temperature, not hot and cold like I first thought - but that could just be me being useless). I have stayed in Barcelona many times in the past and normally stayed down near the port or the Ramblas however this hotel was slightly out of the 'tourist' centre which I really enjoyed. There are some really nice bars and restaurants near by (my favourite was Maitea Taberna, it is a must if you are staying in this hotel, only 2 minutes walk and great food. Read the reviews on this site). Although I did walk to the Ramblas from the hotel one day I would probably recomend the metro if you want to get about without blisters. There is a stop only one minutes walk from the hotel (called Hospital Clinic) which will give you quick access to the whole city. Travel Tip: I would definitely recommend getting a T-10 ticket for the metro, it saves you a lot of money and makes travel so easy. As the name would suggest you get ten trips on bus or metro and can be used by more than one person (just leave it on the top of the barrier for your friend to use behind you). Every time you use the ticket it tells you on the display how many trips you still have left...",
            "I loved the 232. A very stylish, boutique hotel without the stylish boutique hotel prices! We paid around \u00a370 bed and breakfast per night. The hotel is in the Eixample area of the city, a bit quieter than the hussle and bussle of the tourist area but still only 20 minutes walk from the Ramblas or 2 minutes on the metro which is only 2 minutes walk from the hotel (Hospital Clinic station). The hotel provides great breakfast (cooked and continental), a great gym and a superb roof terrace. There's a bar on the ground floor serving drinks and snacks. There's a good selection of local bars and restaurants in the surrounding area. The staff are friendly, the decor is wonderful. I'll stay here again.",
            "We stayed here for the second half of a 10 day trip to Lisbon-Barcelona last Autumn. The weather was great and so was U232! Although our particular room was a bit small, with no view to speak of, the beds were very comfortable, the air conditioning was good and the bathroom very clean and modern. The front desk staff were lively, comical and very helpful, and the female bartender made hefty drinks.The location is great, a block from the Metro, in a nice neighborhood, and you could be in the Ramblas in 20 minutes walking. We walked to la Sagrada Familia, etc. and there are nice restaurants in the area of the hotel, there was one 'inoteca that is a wine store in the front and a large restaurant in the back with very tasty food. Ask them at the front desk about it. If you're there for several days, don't miss the chance to go to the picturesque nearby seaside town of Sitges, only an inexpensive 30 minute train ride from the Central Railway Station. When in the Ramblas, don't miss the Plaza Garibaldi, a very beautiful palm lined courtyard and fountain which is great for taking photos.",
            "Very pleased with our recent stay. The staff were helpful and courteous (someone had obviously been smoking in our non-smoking room and they quickly arranged for another; we later saw that they were airing out the first room) and the location was safe, centrally located, and near good restaurants. Our room was very quiet, clean, and tastefully decorated with a decent bed/mattress and a terrific bathroom. Very good value. There are plenty of cafes nearby, so that you can skip the 14 Euro buffet breakfast.",
            "I took my husband here for a surprise trip for his 30th birthday. The rooms were a really good size, they were stylishly decorated with excellent showers and really comfortably beds. It felt like the place had only recently been refurbished but I don't think it had. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful, recommending some excellent places to eat and visit. The only slight negative would be that this is about a half hour walk from a lot of the central touristy places but to be honest that was a bonus for us as it was nice and quiet in the evenings.",
            "We reserved two rooms because we were traveling with our college aged children. The wifi connection was great so our kids were fully entertained. We reserved one of the hotel's \"top\" rooms which had a shower which didn't work properly. The hotel could not get it fixed over the Easter weekend and moved us to a beautiful room with a good view and plenty of room. The staff was helpful, and the hotel has an attractive bar area for grabbing a drink before or after dinner. Very good restaurants in the area, including 2 by a restaurant owner with a last name of \"Olive.\" The staff will be able to direct you. It was so crowded in city center that being a metro ride away was a pleasure. Would return to the hotel.",
            "We were looking for a hotel away from the tourist areas but still very accessible to the sites of the city. U232 was perfect for us. The Metro was very close and we were within walking distance to wonderful neighborhoods. The rooms were small but very well appointed and comfortable. The staff was terrific and went out of their way to help us enjoy the stay. Each afternoon we really enjoyed getting a bottle of wine and heading up to the rooftop terrace.",
            "The U232 is a lovely, clean and convenient hotel. My wife and I would certainly stay there again. The staff was friendly and helpful. Georgina was especially awesome. She always greeted us with a smile and her English was fantastic. The location was adequate. The hotel lies 1.5 blocks friom the metro. My wife and I thought we would walk every where and would have little need of the metro. we were wrong. Still walked a ton but the metro is an absolute necessity. it is cean, fast and on time. The T-10 card is a must. The room was smallish but it served our needs as we really only slept there. The bathroom/shower was fine. Really no complaints at all. Cafe el fornet is just across the street. We ate breakfast there every day, usually <10 euros. We did not eat or drink anything at the hotel so can't comment on that. there are several small grocery stores and a large Dept store well within walking distance. the dept store (on Av Diagonal) has a large grocery store. Tip: Had wallet stolen while getting on the metro at 3 PM returning from Parc Guell (Lesseps). Three A-holes surrounded me as I was getting on the metro (one in front blocking my way, one on my side and one behind). It happened very quickly (seconds). I recognized what happened immediately(as this scenario was described elsewhere) but they timed it perfectly an jumped off the metro just as the door were closing. I had my wallet in a bottoned pocket (cargo shorts) but that did not help. USE A HIDDEN MONEY BELT AND TAKE ONLY THE CASH THAT YOU NEED. Be careful, this happened at 3 in the afternoon not at night. otherwise, we felt safe and never had a problem. Have fun. Would go back to Barcelona and U232 in a heart beat.",
            "We went to Barcelona for a weekend and chose the U232 as it was not too expensive but still in a nice area. The hotel is 5 minutes walk fom the metro (Hospital Clinic) and you can be in the heart of Barcelona in less than 10 minutes. The room was clean and stylish, it was a good size with a huge and suprisingly comfortable double bed. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as it was an extra \u20ac14 each per day. There are a couple of cafes towards the metro stop and we got good breakfasts for less that for both of us. The only other negative thing was that the bathroom towels were really hard, not just a bit short of fabric softener but like nearly doormat level. Still, the staff were pleasant and we left quite happy. I would go back.",
            "I only decided to write this review to point out that if you need to iron your clothes, you can't have an iron or ironing board brought to your room. You need to use their ironing service. Hence my 2 star rating for service. Otherwise, the hotel is very stylish, modern and clean. And the staff speak impressive English and are friendly.",
            "This really is an excellent hotel. Well run, with efficient staff. Quiet rooms in back, nice breakfast room. However, the location is quite far from Gothic Quarter and major sites, and the tour bus does not stop near here. There is metro line 1.5 blocks away, but it does not go anywhere you would want to go, and you have to transfer, with long walks between lines. It is about 6 long blocks to other more convenient metro- and if it is hot in summer, you will not have pleasant walk. For solo travellers, consider a better location, especially for returning at night. The neighborhood itself is pleasant and has many restaurants, but you will not have convenient access to touring.",
            "Arrived at the hotel after just being robbed in Barcelona. Was about 2 minutes away by car when I got a flat tyre at a traffic light. When changing the tyre, somone stole my wife's handbag and made off as a pillion passenger on a scooter (someone who was pretending to help). Later found that this is a common scam, an organised group slashes your tyre and waits for you to stop. Then someone else diverts your attention (the guy on the scooter) while someone else steals your bags etc. Anyway, on to the U232 Hotel.... On checkin, the guy was sympathetic and immediately said he would upgrade my room. Got a fantastic room on the 9th floor with a huge balcony with dining table and sofa. Bathroom had a huge marble bath around 6 feet long with patio doors which opened directly to the balcony. Bedroom was absolute luxury and after the ordeal when we arrived, we felt like staying in the hotel room all night but decided to venture out regardless. At reception, we were given vouchers for a free coctail at the bar. The hotel itself was very luxurious, very well presented. The public toilet was spotless with fresh linen for drying your hands. Also had an internet room with free access on 2 PC's. We didn't eat in the hotel but did notice prices were reasonable for a city location. Basically, the hotel staff and the hoitel ambience made up for what could have been a disasterous trip to Barcelona. p.s. I did get my wifes bag back after I chased after the culprit and pulled him off the bike...",
            "When searching hotels for a two night weekend stay (ex cruise) we did not feel the prices in the city center (Rambles area) represented value in any form when averaged at \u00a3200 per night (double). This location -only a short walk to the Metro station - with a choice of at least three breakfast eateries on the way with endless selections to eat for a few euros - getting into the centre in 15 minutes meant we saved a small fortune. Our room was a good size with large bathroom and all cons necessary. A very comfortable bed and all very clean & I am quiet particular in this area! Any questions at the desk were politely & informatively answered with a smile and maps to help on our first visit to the city. All in all apart from the breakfast cost which we declined as not value which was a good decision as explained above - we feel this hotel deserves the acclaims given by fellow travelers reporting on this site.",
            "Excellent, stylish hotel, staffed by very friendly and helpful professionals. The rooms are modern and well appointed, with a good sized bathroom. Lots of cafes and restaurants within 5 minutes walking distance of the hotel, and the main city attractions are accessible within 20 minutes walk or via the metro system just a few minutes walk from the hotel. Highly recommended.",
            "Far enough away from the busy centre but conveniently placed by the metro and within easy walking distance of Las Ramblas. All staff were friendly and helpful, particularly Fernanda who was in charge of reception during our visit, and who responded very helpfully to our e mails before our stay. Our room was of a good size and very comfortable. We will happily stay again.. Kevin Hurst",
            "We stayed at this hotel on our trip to Barcelona for our 1st anniversary. Small but stylish room with a balcony and the hotel was only a block or so from the metro. And everything we did was within 4 metro stops so while not located in the city center the hotel is definitely in a great spot. The neighborhood was wonderful -- there were cafes, bars and excellent restaurants all within walking distance. The staff was nice and generally helpful but they did forget to give us our wake-up call on the day we left. That was the only negative of the hotel. I would definitely stay there and recommend it to others.",
            "I booked this hotel for both a before and after cruise stay for a group of older adults and paid the sizable 20% non-refundable deposit. I did read the location statement on the company website which states that it is in a quiet residential neighborhood home to some of Gaud\u00ed\u2019s most famous works\u201d. After adding a former stroke victim to my group, I decided to do some more research. I did a google street view of the hotel address and found the area did not look residential at all. Further research indicated that to get to Barcelona City Center was more than most older adults in my group could handle. It involved walking 100 meters (more than three football fields) to the subway and a two subway ride (1 transfer). By now I was skeptical about the safety of the walk to the subway and decided to move my large group to a sister-hotel of this company. I knew I was in for complaints from my group about the location of this hotel. Hotel U232 not only would not transfer my deposit to their sister hotel, but when I wrote them and requested a refund, they responded by billing me for 4 euro cents.",
            "I just spent another few days in BCN and stayed (for the 3rd time) in U232. The hotel is amazing! Very cosy and elegant. Very nice lobby bar and friendly staff. One of the hotels I want to go back and back again. Just feeling on the right place there. Room 711 features a great balcony/terrace with city views. The location of the hotel is one of the best about it - situated just 5 minutes from Via Diagonal and 15 minutes walk from pl. Catalunya or 5 minutes by taxi. Just take a look on the hotel website and You'll get an idea!",
            "This is a boutique style hotel in Barcelona , close to the Metro which gets you downtown in 10 to 15 minutes. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly. The rooms are beautifully decorated in a modern chic style , including flat screen T.V , MiniBar and Air Conditioning. Our teenagers had a twin room which had 2 beds and a seperate sofa and still ample room for luggage , they also found the free wifi a bonus. Our own room had a huge king size bed and a luxurious bathroom which included one of the best showers we have ever seen.The bar area is also in a chic style , with good service , the only downside to our stay was probably the inflated price of the drinks in the bar, which probably accounted for the lack of people using it which resulted in a lack of atmosphere ; the management would be well advised to drop drink prices and encourage more customers and create a Buzz !",
            "This hotel is an excellent value, very clean and modern. Excellent free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. Breakfast was not great and is probably the only area where the hotel didn't meet or exceed expectations. There are numerous shops and restaurants surrounding the hotel which is very convenient.",
            "Stayed for 2 nights and must say was pleasantly surprised. Large rooms, nice and clean. Nice bathroom with shower and bath and also english speaking staff so checking in and out is easy. For the price, you get a great stay in a convenient place. One train from Sagrada Familia and 2 from beach. 25 minutes walk from La Rambla. Had a great stay and would use them again.",
            "We stayed here for three nights and the only criticism we can think off is that the location means that to do anything in town you need to take metro (only 2 minutes walk away) or taxi. Before leaving we read up on the immediate area and it sounded lively and full of bars. It has some life but as much we expected (this for many could be a positive aspect). On to the hotel itself. Modern design, bit dark but stylish. Our room was excellent, huge bed, plenty of space and a good bathroom, nicely designed with view from bathroom to bedroom. Breakfasts were great and all the staff helpful and willing. Would recommend U232 with only the warning about the location.",
            "Nice hotel. Comfy beds. Easy access to both metro and buses. Staff at reception very pleasant and helpful. Restaurants, shops, cafes and supermarkets nearby. More Positives Good nights sleep free internet access with a printer for the residents gym on 10th floor with the added bonus of an open air leisure area beside it. Negatives A little out from La Rambla and beach. However a number 59 bus provided quick and easy access.",
            "Thanks to this hotel and it's location we were able to spend time away from the crowded tourist traps and experience real Barcelona: warm and cosy restaurants, locals watching football at their neighbourhood bars etc. However, the hotel is not actually that far away from the sights, Barcelona's excellent and cheap metro system will take you anywhere in the city and the Hospital Clinic station is located only 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel is decorated with unique, modern style inside out the hotel. The reception staff was friendly and we got some excellent restaurant tips as well as instructions how to reach different sites. The free wireless network is available everywhere in the hotel, but the idle time is set very short and you may need to reconnect quite often. Perhaps the only minus for this hotel experience was the breakfast. Even though the basic selection was adequote, the quality of food was not consistent. Warm dishes at the buffet were not warm enough and the local tomato sauce for bread should be available all the time.",
            "We stayed at U232 for four nights. It was our first time in Barcelona and we enjoyed our stay at U232. Here are some pros and cons: Pros: - Very good value - Close to the metro (approx 5 mins walk) - Travel times via metro to the centre are approx. 15 - 20 minutes depending on where you go. Metros go every 2.5 minutes or so. - Good sized rooms (we stayed on the 6th floor overlooking the court yard in a U232 room) - Clean, modern and very quiet. - Very helpful staff - Free WIFI - Late checkout (noon) - Close to Maitea Taberna (good value and quality tapas) - Supermarket and ATM around the corner. Cons: - No iron & iron board. There are laundry facilities available but at high prices. Approx 8 Euros for washing and ironing a single shirt. We ended up buying a travel iron at Carrefour. - No clock in the room. No big deal when you are on holidays but somewhat surprising. - Relatively expensive breakfast. Better value breakfast options are available across and down the road. - The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a double glass window. Inside the double glass appear to be some blinds which can be electronically adjusted. However this did not work for us. Not a big deal for us, but we found it surprising that it could not be manually adjusted. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at U232 and would recommend this hotel.",
            "My boyfriend and I have just returned from u232 after a week's stay. It is a really nice, clean and modern hotel. Rooms are of an excellent size and are of a high standard. The hotel is ideally located for the metro, and is a 20 minute walk away from La Ramblas. It is worth buying a T10 card which allows you 10 trips on the metro and can be shared. The roof terrace is a gorgeous space to read, sunbathe and have drinks with some jazz in the background. I would definitely stay here again!",
            "Arrived @ 11 am, and was able to check in straight away. Staff friendly and polite. Our room was on the 10th floor and just as we had imagined it would be, clean, modern and very spacious. Bathrooms nice only down side was that one of the showers did not work and the one that did was slow. One big down side for me was that we were unable to have the use of an iron in the room as the hotel only offer an ironing service. Hotel location only one block away and very easy to use! We had a T10 ticket and this lasted for three days for two of us and the cost was under 9 Euro. I would recommend this hotel as all in all we really enjoyed having it as a base for our city trip.",
            "We stayed at this excellent Hotel for two nights to attend the first U2 360 Concert at Camp Nou. The location was just superb. 15minute taxi to Camp Nou. 2 minute walk for the underground station to expore the city of Barcelona. There is a caferteria just as you go out of the Hotel on the right and a supermarket around the block on the left. I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff is nice. The hotel is clean and the location as mentioned above is simply superb.",
            "Nice hotel for the value. Rooms were over sized for European standards. We had a room on the top floor with a great terrace including table and chairs. Small fitness room but offered if it's on your list of musts. Not sure why you'd place 15 or 20 euro for breakfast when there are great little coffe shops within a block or two.",
            "Hotel U232 just rocks! I was recommended to stay at U233 by none other than fellow Tripadvisor travelers (of course - who else do you actually trust with great travel suggestions?). After having read the rave reviews, I made my reservation through Wonderlandhotels - which in itself was an absolute pleasure to deal with - one of their representatives, Ali was fantastic, and could not have been more helpful. U232 is so centrally situated and within convenient walking distances from all major attractions. The Hotel itself is spotless, and very swish. Great interior design - and everything worked! The rooms were a pleasure - and the housekeeper staff were excellent and thoroughly impressed me. The little touches added to one's comfort and just made the experience that much more pleasurable. I must make special mention of the wonderful front desk assistance we received. No request was too much trouble. In particular, I must single out Mr Sebastian Elorza who really was fantastic in giving us general touristy kind of trips, and in particular, his recommendations as to which restaurants to visit. Two of them, namely el Pintor and Paco Meralgo hit the nail right on the head - and were really great gastronomic experiences . To Sebastian, all staff, and management, a HUGE thumbs up - you guys are doing a fabulous job. Many thanks, Dirk, 17 on Loader Guest House, Cape Town.",
            "I stayed for 8 nights at this hotel in April 2011. My stay here was fantastic. I loved the staff, loved the ample size of the room and loved that I was far enough away from the downtown that I had to walk 30 minutes to get anywhere (although this might not be for everyone). The staff spoke English very well and seemed to either want to speak English or Catalan as they were very proud of their Catalan heritage. The staff were also very eager to help one out to find a nice restaurant and I took them up on their offer on more than one occasion. There were 2 slight downsides: a) the room pointed at nothing, but hey! I don't stay in a different city for a perfect landscape view b) Breakfast was way too expensive, and so I didn't pay for it. Next time I stay in Barcelona I would come back to this hotel as I really enjoyed my stay here.",
            "Drawbacks: - The location is a bit far fetched; for example, It takes approximately 30-45 minutes to walk from the hotel to Plaza de Catalonia - The noise from the street Urgell. The first night we had a twin room at the second floor with windows out against the noisy street Urgell. However, we were able to change to a quiet double room the following four nights. - Our room was a bit small, however the bathroom was okay Advantages: - Nice interior - Friendly staff - A lot of accessories in the bathroom - Free Internet",
            "We grabbed a three day break in Barcelona just before Easter. The hotel was a pleasant surprise - very helpful staff and the rooms were clean and comfortable- would def stay here again. Dont be put off by the distance out of the centre - thats a plus - either grab a cab(Euros8~10 to the center), or take the Metro for aro Euro1.40 for a single trip (its a short walk of about 200m). Good Friday was really busy at all the attractions (as all the shops were closed) good idea to take the tour bus to get your bearings.",
            "Lovely hotel. Staff very helpful. We arrived after midnight and wanted a drink the bar was closed but the receptionist gave us a map and showed us where to go. They also booked a dinner and show for us. The rooms were very very clean and the decor was great, good hairdryer, powerful shower, mirror and lighting good. What more do you need!",
            "U232 offered better service than most 5* hotels we stayed. Everything was just right for us. - Friendly, always helpful staff that speaks English - Very accommodating when we switched rooms because of the street noise. (Barcelona - - was very noisy because of the soccer world cup celebrations.) - Breakfast was very nice, with something for everybody - The entrance and the rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean - Free PCs with fast and reliable internet connection, which we didn't have in any other hotel in Spain. - Parking is available right next door I don\u2019t think that Barcelona has another hotel that offers that much value for its price. We payed 90 Euro with a great breakfast and welcoming drinks. The location didn\u2019t seem that great in the beginning, but we realized that by taking the bus instead of the subway (2 bus lines are just 2 minutes away and those buses covered all our needs) it was easy and cheap to get around.",
            "I have become a regular visitor to this hotel thanks to its exceptional value for money. The hotel has a modern look to it but with all the warmth of the latin people. The rooms are excellent and there is also plenty of options to hold small/medium sized meetings with clients. Internet is free of charge ! Only negative side is the breakfast, a bit expensive for what you get. Should be improved and certainly increase the variety to offer. Would recommend both for business and leisure, better for couples or small families.",
            "We stayed here for 2 nights on a recent holiday. The hotel staff were helpful and efficient. The hotel lobby is warm and cosy. Our room had a balcony and was of a good size. The decor was of good quality and the room and bathroom were very clean. The location of the hotel is approximately 30 minutes walk to La Rambla, however, there is a metro stop only 2 minutes away. There are numerous shops and businesses in the area. The area is quiet at night, so you will need to travel to more lively areas to find a nice bar or restaurant. Free wifi is available also. Overall, a great stay and excellent value. I would stay again definitely.",
            "A very positive experience. The hotel offered a very good rate for a fully cancellable booking - under \u20ac85/night. We arrived early in the morning, but the hotel let us have our rooms immediately - greatly appreciated after an overnight flight. Desk staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms are stylish and comfortable. (Smallish by American standards, but just fine actually) Wifi Internet is free, and there is a computer center for printing boarding passes and the like. The location is slightly off the beaten path (in Eixample about a 20 minute walk from the Passeig de Gracia) but take advantage of that and view the beautiful Beaux Arts architecture in the neighborhood. It's also nice to have some distance from the Rambla. I did not eat breakfast at the hotel (there are inexpensive cafes right on the corner) and there is no gym. I would happily stay here again.",
            "We stayed at the U232 in Barcelona June 1-3, 2011 and had a great experience. We arrived very early in the morning, hours before check in, but the friendly and helpful staff stored our luggage for us, gave us the wireless code, and a comfortable place to sit and relax. By the time we'd had a cup of coffee and checked our email, our (spacious) room was ready. If I was forced to find one fault, it would be that something they used in the hotel (an air freshener or cleaner?) was a bit overpowering. It was located in a nice area with easy access to anything you would want. I would gladly recommend this hotel.",
            "the hotel is very calm, with pleasant jazz background music in the common spaces, excellent accessibility Internet, public transport means to walk, rooms and lobby very fashion and clean, You can reach all points of interest of the City with Metro located at 50 meters from the hotel",
            "Stayed here for 4 nights and really loved it. Check-in went smoothly and personnel is very friendly and helpful. The hotel and rooms look like new; it's very clean and tidy. In the room there are all kinds of bathroom amenities offered. Metro stop Hospital Clinic is only like 100metres away and there are nice places nearby for breakfast or midnight snack (probably also for lunch and dinner, but we were not at/near the hotel during the day).",
            "Just stayed here with my husband for two nights and were so glad we chose the U232. We went for the \"top room\" which cost half as much as a standard room in many hotels off La Rambla. Location turned out to be good, actually, if you don't mind hopping on the Metro--only a block from the Hospital-Clinic Metro stop, which is just a few stops from the train station and also the Segrada Familia. The room (908) was absolutely fantastic. We loved the huge private balcony on a corner, with 180 degree views over the city. The bathroom was very spacious with a shower I would love to have in my house--two shower extensions, plus a rain shower. The hotel was stylish and very clean, with helpful staff, a business center with free internet access and a printer. Oh--and breakfast was really good as well...great coffee."

Prepared for a charming, homey place, we immediately knew we had chosen badly when we saw exterior and lobby. Tacky and shabby. Maybe OK for a business traveler on a budget. Breakfast was dismal, with boxed cereal and some yoghurt. Bad location for anything but business. Manager was very nice and quite helpful. Internet was free and worked well.",

Once they meet you, the staff remembers you forever! Am writing this review late,(January 2011) because we recently stayed at an upscale hotel in NO and it paled in comparison. Upscale was not nearly as comfortable, nor was the service as good--and no breakfast included. Hope to stay at Quality Inn New Orleans again this year.",

In addition to reasonable rates, you get free hot breakfast buffet, free internet, free local phone calls, reasonably priced garage (catty corner), a location that is a reasonable walking distance from the French Quarter and downtown attractions, and an excellent and friendly staff. This is an ideal place for a New Orleans visit, business or leisure.",

The desk staff and housekeepers are unbelievably helpful and friendly. They're a great resource for finding excellent places to eat and the best/safest places to tour. Although the rooms and hallways seem in need of an update everything was very clean and comfortable. The breakfasts were probably the best I've had at a Quality Inn and are a bit more extensive than the typical doughnut and cereal continental breakfasts you usually get.",

They went all out to make sure that my stay was comfortable and provided all the information that I needed to get around town. The location was only about three blocks off of Bourbon St. and close enough that I walked everywhere. Business at the conference center and meals in the quarter were all an easy walk. I would stay here again with out question.",
            "I just loved my stay at the Quality Inn and Suites last night. My husband, myself and our two college age sons stayed in 2 rooms. We were there to see a Hormets game and the Arena and Superdome were just blocks away. The staff was the best ever based on my previous traveling experiences. This is not a 5 star hotel, but for what it is and the price, it''s the best bargain in New Orleans. I was somewhat worried as one reviewer was afraid of the neighborhood. I was with 3 large men but I would not have been afraid if I was with girl friends. The area is well traveled and I saw no transients. Mr. Stanley the general manager upgraded both my room and our sons' room to suites at no additional charge. Parking was close and was only $14 a day, I have paid $30 at the Doubletree and Sheraton. I plan to return there in June as some old college buddies are getting together. We will all be staying at the Quality Inn and I know we will have a great experience.",
            "Great place. Like many other people, we were upgraded (he said because we were staying several days) and we were checked in early. The room had 2 queen beds, a couch and an easy chair and was very spacious. It also had a microwave, fridge and cabinets and was very clean. We were close to the elevator and there was no issue with a loud bell. Housekeeping was very good and kept the room clean and well supplied. The breakfast was great--except the eggs!!!! They were overcooked and had an odd texture--maybe they were dried? We couldn't eat them, but they had hard boiled ones as well that were perfectly done and peeled. They also had either bacon or link sausage, cheese cubes, grits (good--need salt), pastry, muffins, waffles, cereal, juice, coffee, water. It runs until 9:30, or 10:00 on weekends and is kept well stocked. All in all a great hotel at a super price (comparatively speaking).",
            "I recently shared a room with a friend during our recent attendance at a meeting in New Orleans.The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.. The breakfast was very good. ; the rooms were clean. We were given a room with almost separate queen beds.Each \"room\" had its own TV., And the location 3 blooks from the French quarter couldn't be better. The convention center is about a mile away, but that makes for a nice brisk morning walk",
            "We booked this hotel because of the reviews we read on Trip Advisor and because of it's value. We were very pleased with our stay. The staff is very friendly, making it a point to say hello and greeting you with a smile or by your name. The free breakfast was also good. It was a nice selection of breads, \"make-your-own\" waffles, breakfast meats, cereal, yogurt, muffins, juices, tea and coffee. It was well stocked and neatly presented at a buffet bar. There is a parking fee, but very reasonable. Everything is pretty much in walking distance, we did not use our car at all during our stay. The room was clean, minor cosmetic issues, but overall a comfortable room. I would definately stay here again.",

I would say that in this country, I have never seen such helping and good staff anywhere in any hotel. No doubt this hotel is number one in New Orleans. Also it is pretty safe and walkable to all the important conference venues and tourist places.",

            "Nice hotel in a nice location. Very close from the town action and from the street car stops. Breakfast was OK, taking into account that was included in the price (we've paid 80$/night). After staying the first night in a room just besides the elevator, on next day we were moved to a more distant room to avoid the elevator's noise. Stanley, as already mentioned, is very helpful and very friendly and the 5th point is entirely for him (otherwise I would have rated as a 4)! We'd definetely go back if we go again to New Orleans.",
            "It wasn't the huge hot breakfast that made me rate this hotel excellent. Although the selection of waffles, grits, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, pastries, muffins (the chocolate ones are yumO), bagels, bread, cereals, fruit, yogurt, juices & of course, tea & coffee was certainly the most impressive I've seen yet at a value hotel. It wasn't even the no hassle complimentary King bed upgrade. You know how with most hotels you have to practically plead for an upgrade and staff act put out that they must consider this incredible favour? Not here, they don't have any of that negative front desk staff attitude at all! It was the truly friendly helpful staff that will always stand out in my mind. From the very first person to greet us, to all the front desk staff. We were always warmly greeted when we came into the lobby, & given many great suggestions. This is unique to any hotel we've stayed at.\u00e2\u02dc\u00ba The hotel exceeded my expectations. I figured, it's New Orleans, they get a gazillion tourists, they must be sick of answering questions & recommending places, and we're no different than all the other tourists. Plus, the exterior pictures of this place don't necessarily say \"Welcome\". But don't judge a book by it's cover. The staff were completely welcoming. They treated us like we were special. I simply couldn't ask for more in a hotel. This kind of service is what I imagined famous southern hospitality is. You've raised the bar, Quality Inn & Suites (Downtown New Orleans).",
            "We stayed here based on tripadvisor recommendations and they were quite accurate. There was a mix up with our room so they bent over backwards to fix it. I am a clean freak but this older hotel suited me just fine. Beware of the $17 parking fee though. Overall a great rate for a great location.",
            "Like other reviewers, I was excited that I had gotten a great hotel for a cheap price, but I was sorely disappointed. Great customer service goes a long way, but it does not make up for the hotel's issues. The Good: The service really is as good as everyone says. Art (a popular man at the front desk) is fantastic at his job. He really does go the extra mile. He anticipated any issues we might have and acted accordingly. He was very helpful in setting up tours and airport transportation, and provided valuable information about the area. Also, breakfast is included and is pretty good, even for the picky eaters in my party. Our room had two bedrooms, connected by a bathroom. It seems like it was a one-bedroom suite where they just made the living room into a bedroom. We were very happy with the room. The Bad: The hotel is quite old and needs renovating. The photos are more flattering than they should be. The location, while a 4 block walk to Bourbon, is located in a pretty sketchy area. In order to get to the bars and restaurants, you have to walk through a really ghetto section. Even though there were three of us travelling together, we had to take cabs home because it simply wasn't safe enough to walk home. Across the street is a vacated office building, and there are several parking lots nearby. This would be fine if we had no intentions of going out to dinner or for drinks at night, but no one wants to be that stressed on vacation. Overall: The hotel is a good value for a family or a group who has no intentions of leaving the hotel in the evening. Otherwise, bring ear plugs and just stay in the quarter. As a young woman who loves travelling, safety is always my biggest concern. Great customer service is not worth a lack of safety.",
            "I settled on 4 stars overall for the Quality Inn. If I could use half stars, I would have settled on 3.5 stars. There is a lot to like about this place. The location in particular is great. Easy walking distance to the french quarter/bourbon st area. It is also very good value for the location. In truth, the rooms are only average. Decent size, but a bit worn and dark. Very small bathroom and a bad shower. Overall I would say the are serviceable- not terrible, bu not great either. Breakfast is ok, but if you want a good brunch my advice is skip it. Valet parking is actually up the road... not really valet either as you are expected to drive it up yourself and pick it up. There is parking out the front to unload luggage. The valet is ok value, but just beware that it is not on site (or even all that close by) and is not technically valet. Overall, good value, good location, average rooms and half valet parking. I would recommend Quality Inn with a few reservations.",
            "Definitely agree with other positive reviews. Close enough to walk to the French Quarter but far enough away when you need a break from the zaniness of the Quarter. One block west of Canal Street which provides convenient walking access to streetcars and the Quarter. Hotel room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was adequate. Hotel staff were friendly and professional. We arrived around 10 am, well before check-in, so they stored our luggage and made sure we had a room by 2:00. They also let us check out late, around 2:15, and called a cab to pick us up at 5:15 for the trip to the airport. I neglected to get the name of the desk manager that helped us on check out day, but he was the best. Will definitely stay here again next time we visit NO.",
            "We chose this hotel based on reviews, and while we did, indeed find the staff very courteous and delightful (they were alway polite and helpful), there isn't much they could have done for the hard beds, leaky faucets, and broken safe. Pros: - Average (but free!) hotel breakfast: continental offerings plus eggs, grits, a meat, and a waffle maker - Courteous, polite staff (I'm not sure I could say that enough - they were very good!) -Clean, decent accomodations and decor -Within walking distance of French Quarter and streetcar lines -Felt safe -Subway restaurant right next door (we didn't use it, but someone might!) Cons: -The bed was as hard as a dry river bed at the end of a 100-year drought - we could not sleep and got up in pain every morning. We almost changed hotels for this one reason. It actually affected our ability to enjoy our trip, because we hurt too much to walk everywhere! That's how bad they were. (And we're pretty healthy, well-exercised people!) -The bathroom faucet leaked all over the counter constantly -The bathroom ceiling tiles were offset and the ceiling fixtures rusty -We're used to sleeping with a fan running (white noise), but there was no \"fan\" in the bedroom. The AC control is in the living room of the suite, and it was quiet (ok, ok... I know, I 'm complaining about a hotel room being quiet at night?? Sheesh!) Overall, a nice place in the daytime, but we would not be able to stay there again because of the beds.",
            "I can't say enough about the great staff at Quality Inn. Everyone was so friendly and went out of their way to help us secure cabs several times....not an easy task during Mardi Gras parades. Room was clean and he location is great ..........you just can't beat the price. Would absolutely stay again.",
            "The Quality Inn & Suites is #1 for good reason. My brother and I stayed here for 3 nights, Oct 22-24. We wont even entertain the idea of staying anywhere else when we return next year. Stanley, the General Manager, was outstanding! I booked my reservations through a travel web site, they web site stated that parking, $17 a day, would be comped by booking through them. Needless to say, It wasnt. I explained the situation to Stanley, and he said it wasn't a problem and he comped the parking anyway. When we needed directions to different places around New Orleans, Stanley was there! Not to be overlooked, his staff was outstanding as well, very friendly and nice. I could not have asked for better service from Stanley and his staff! The hotel itself does not look like much from the outside, but dont let the looks fool you. The inside of the hotel is nice and clean, as were the rooms. Although the bathroom was a little small, lets be honest, how much time do you actually spend in your hotel when your in New Orleans anyways! The hotel is also only 3 blocks from Bourbon St! The continental breakfast is perfect fare for starting your day, its actually more like a full breakfast buffet than a continental breakfast. Waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage, fresh fruit, cold cereal, coffee, tea, juice, pastries, assorted yogurt, etc. With that said, a big thumbs up to The Quality Inn & Suites, New Orleans LA. We will be back, count on it! !",
            "Stayed here two nights. As per other reviews the hotel is great value in comparison to costs of other hotels in area. Only a short walk to French Quarter and streetcar to Garden District. Parking is provided in nearby garage at cost of $17 which hotel will charge to your room. This compares to regular 24 hour parking rate of $29. Room was comfortble and clean. New Orleans is an expensive place in and around the French Quarter for accommodation, meals and parking but if this is the area you want to see then there is no point in staying in the suburbs. The QI is excellent value and a great spot to spend a few days without blowing the bank.",
            "The location proved to be perfect for attending the Final Four, as the hotel is close for walking to any of the city's main neighborhoods but also close to the streetcars. The breakfast was extensive, the rooms and hotel overall were clean and well kept, and everything else one would want in a good hotel stay was experienced. But it was the staff that really made our stay and the place excellent. Our rooms were upgraded for us upon our arrival with particular attention paid to the access needs of my 88 year-old father-in-law. And it just got better from there. It was, by far, the friendliest most helpful staff I've ever encountered at a hotel.",
            "Ditto with everyone's comments. This place is the best deal out there. It's definitely not a 5 star hotel but it is perfectly fine for a great stay in a great city. The management and staff are helpful, the rooms are clean and comfortable, the breakfasts are more than adequate with hot items too (sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs), and the location is just ideal - within easy walking distance to everything. To top this all off, the rates are so reasonable too. The rate for one of our evenings was considerably higher than the rest of our evenings but the hotel had no problem adjusting the rate to make it consistent with the rest of our stay. We very much appreciated that. We got lucky booking the last available rooms for the week we were visiting and we are so pleased we did.",
            "We chose this hotel based on the reviews and ranking on this site. It wasn't as close to the French Quarter as I had hoped. The room had an odor in which there was an air purifier going when we entered the room. Soon after, someone came in and removed it. The sink was stopped up and the water drained VERY slowly. The staff was great and very helpful and the breakfast was a plus.",
            "Booked a 2-night stay here based solely on its TripAdvisor rating, and we weren't disappointed. After a long drive down from Memphis, we were welcomed, upgraded and checked in and then shown the way to the parking garage, all of 50 yards past the hotel. Our smoking suite on the 9th floor was nice and spacious, bizarrely none of the windows can be opened so you are relying on the aircon to clear the smoke - not ideal. Yes, this is just one step up from a motel so some things are a little shabby - the net curtains in the room were filthy, and the windows themselves are dirty and look badly finished. But the core product is absolutely fine - floors and bedding are clean, furniture is in good condition, and the breakfast is a small step above the average due to the availability of hot food. Unfortunately the juice machine was broken and no alternative was available. However, as with previous reviews, it's the staff that make this place. They are abundantly friendly, happy to chat and full of useful information too. Considering the number of soulless chain hotels in the vicinity, this is a very good option if you're on a budget or you want something a little different. Just a block from Canal Street and 3 blocks from Bourbon, the location is ideal and seems safe enough. Highly recommended.",
            "Not fancy, but a good value. My room actually had no window which was a little strange and somewhat disconcerting, so you may wish to ask about that when you check in. But the staff were very helpful and went out of their way to improve my stay. When I complained about the small pillows, they bought me a new, bigger one still in the bag.",
            "My wife and daughter (who was moving to NOLA with a new job) booked this hotel from the road because of its location and price. Now they cannot stop saying enough good things about their stay at this place. At first they did not know how many nights they would be staying (it ended up being 8 nights). After the movers arrived with my daughter's stuff, one new white pant suit had been damaged. Someone on the staff offered to take it to the local dry cleaner and then the manager, Mr. Stanley, kept at it till the problem (which the hotel obviously had nothing to do with) was resolved. Seriously, where do you get this kind of service these days? My family said the complimentary daily breakfast served was terrific and varied. The entire staff was outstanding. Now that our daughter has moved to NOLA, this hotel has won our stay during future visits for a long, long time to come. With a manager and staff of this caliber, no wonder so many of the reviews mention the staff as being so helpful and caring. Keep up the good work!",
            "Arrived off ship late morning for a 2day stay of new Orleans. Offered us our rooms if we wanted to wait 25 min. Upgraded us to King Size. Very friendly front desk staff. Continental breakfast excellent even included scrambled eggs, sausage and waffles. Staff in the dining room very efficient and personable. Location to Bourbon St. very close by as further into the French Quarter about a 10 min. walk. Hotel is older and not modern but had a lovely upgraded bathroom. It is not a luxury hotel but if looking for a comfortable place to stay we all enjoyed it.",
            "The customer service was exceptional. It is an older hotel but in very good condition with lots of charm & character. We were upgraded to a mini suite which was on the corner with a great view of the bustling downtown area. We walked to French Quarter & Riverwalk.",
            "We visit New Orleans at least once per month and have stayed at almost all of the major hotels there. Once we discovered this hotel we discovered our home away from home. Great location, as one can walk to all attractions, French Quarters, River Walk, Superdome, etc. The staff, beginning with Mr. Stanley' are the best. Never have we received customer service like we enjoy at this hotel. We travel very often and I must say a frequent traveler willl not be disappointed with this hotel. We have never had a bad experience at this hotel and we have stayed there numerous times. I can see why tripadvisor has it ranked #1. We will be down for the French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest, and we will be staying at the best hotel in New Orleans, Quality Inn & Suites Downtown.",
            "WOW, The most amazing service, made me feel that I stayed in a 5 star hotel or better! Stanley, the manager, greeted us and remembered our names for the rest of the stay. He took care of us and really made everything to make sure our stay was excellente. The room was clean, big and very nice. Perfect location and we felt very safe walking home(about 10 minutes) from the French district at night. We enjoyed our stay so much we decided to extend our stay. Thank you Quality Inn and Stanley for a lovely time in Nola. ( A lot of hotel could learn a lot from this one when it comes to customer service).",
            "This hotel does not look like anything special and it does not have a courtyard or any New Orleans architecture but the service and location are great. The manager Stanley and his team do a fantastic job of making you feel welcome and like part of the family. They are very knowledgeable about New Orleans and all that goes on there. This is a multi-year award winning hotel. Located just two blocks from the French Quarter it is very convenient to all major attractions and street car lines. But it is just far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon and Canal streets. I have stayed here 3 times and I would highly recommend. A complimentary breakfast is included.",
            "We stayed one night at the Quality Inn in downtown New Orleans and were extremely pleased. The staff was very accommodating and friendly and went above and beyond with everything. The parking was reasonable and they also gave discount vouchers. The rooms were modern, clean and the beds were very comfortable! Our room was a little small but it was still ok for us. We also had a mini fridge and a kitchen sink. They also had hot breakfast from 6:30 am- 9:30 am. The location was also nice.",
            "We have stayed at this hotel 3 times now and were pleased each time. Each time the front desk staff have been helpful and pleasant. The rooms have all been clean and well equipped. The free breakfast is varied and quite complete. And the distance to the French Quarter is close enough to easily walk, but far enough to be quiet. We would recommend it to anyone traveling to New Orleans.",
            "If you're looking for a hotel with an impressive lobby and room service, this isn't it. However, if you're looking for a hotel with a fabulous location, clean rooms, comfortable beds, and a great price, this is the one you want. Oh, and you'll be treated like a VIP here, even if you're paying for the cheapest room they have. We stayed Wednesday night through Friday night and were upgraded from a queen room to a king room at no extra charge. Everything we asked for was provided quickly and with a smile. Every member of the staff we interacted with was friendly, helpful, and seemed to love serving their customers. The location for this hotel couldn't be beat. It's about 4 blocks from Bourbon St. (far enough away so it's not noisy) and within an easy walk from some of the best restaurants in New Orleans. Plus, it's close to the Streetcar lines, which will take you to many of the best parts of the city. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants great service, great location, and a great price.",
            "Obviously, this motel is a great place. I just wanted to add that the front desk folks are the best I've ever encountered. We needed to store our luggage the morning of our check in and it was not a problem whatsoever. Mr. Stanley, as mentioned, is super friendly. The location isn't in a shady area as a previous poster claimed. We felt perfectly safe walking back from the Vampire tour we took in the French Quarter! :)",
            "This is a great location to Bourbon Steet and the French Quarter. The staff was very nice. The breakfast was average. Rooms were clean but the beds were lumpy due to mattress pads that had seen better days. Overall this hotel was a great deal for the money.",
            "We stayed at this hotel last February (Superbowl weekend) and will stay there again. We went with a sports group to New Orleans and had a fantastic time. First and foremost, don't confuse the fantastic ratings this hotel gets with expectations of being pampered like you are paying $500/night. The entire appeal of this hotel is based on Service, Location and Value. You can't beat this hotel in any of these features in New Orleans. In terms of service, I've never met a more enthusiastic group of employees who want to do nothing but give the very best customer service. The people working the desk could have been swamped with a hundred people checking in at once and they are just as eager to help the next person or to recommend a spot to eat. The \"continental\" breakfast goes well beyond your standard bread and cereal breakfast. You will save at least $10/person/day on breakfast alone. If you have any issues in the room their response time is minutes, not hours. Location is just about perfect. Close enough to Bourbon street that you can walk there within a couple of minutes but far enough away (and tucked into a side street) to block out the noise when you do want to go to bed. We were there the night the Saints won the superbowl and even though the party was going on well past 5am, you wouldn't know it when you went to sleep. Value you just can't beat when you factor in the other 2. Our rate was about $100/night and that was about $30/night cheaper than any other hotel I could find near the same location. Without everything else, it's your standard Quality Inn, and if you go in expecting that you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
            "This is a nice property located two blocks from the French Quarter. It has the amenities one expects from this chain - clean secure rooms at reasonable prices, comfortable beds. The complimentary breakfast is better than usual for a Comfort property. What set the place apart for me was the extraordinary staff. They were always friendly and helpful, without being intrusive. When we arrived they gave us walking directions for the places we wanted to see, along with tips to help assure our safety. The people here were.... great.",
            "We booked here because of Trip Advisor reviews and it was #1 for us also. It was within walking distance of the French Quarter and all of the points of interest we had time to do in 2 days. They also recommended the best tours, which we did with a van ride of the city and a walking ghost tour. All were rated 5 stars for us. Breakfast was also both hot and cold foods which was more than enough to get us started for a busy day. They even let us stay beyond the checkout time to walk the streets as we didn't need to catch our cruise boat until after 12pm. The room was actually 2 rooms which turned out well for us as one was a snorer. All we had ordered was 2 queen beds. Recommend it highly.",
            "Don't ask me how this place gets its rave reviews. Yes, the Reception staff are friendly but personally I'd rather have a clean room. The bathroom was dirty with old hair in the basin plughole. When I dropped the soap on the floor, it came up covered with long brown hairs. Well, I'm a blonde and my husband has a crew cut.... Towels were old and stained. The room itself was a good size with comfortable beds but the decor was old-fashioned and glooomy with a very strong smell of furniture polish. Reception staff were friendly but the porter literally tried to grap my husband's suitcase out of his hands even after he had said that he preferred to wheel it himself. On the plus side, the location is excellent; less that 5 minutes' walk to the French Quarter. All in all, a resounding \"OK\".",
            "We had four nights hear and really loved the place. Highlights include the buffet breakfast (hot and cold food, including a fantastic waffle maker) and the really helpful staff who helped us with some itinerary problems we were facing. The location was fantastic because it wasn't right in the French Quarter, but was only a short 5 minute walk to Bourbon Street and all the craziness that exists there. It was great to get away from the noise when we wanted to sleep. The room was huge and had two TV's and a mini kitchenette and a lounge room. The place was more like an apartment that a hotel room.",
            "Hotel is very close to French Quarter, however about 2 blocks in the wrong direction. The immediate area around the hotel is basically a business district, unfortunately in some immediate areas its a slum -- abandoned buildings, shady bars, low-rent liquor stores, etc. Lobby, staff, breakfast area are all fine, in fact some members of the staff are excellent. Real downside of this hotel is actually a City of New Orleans problem -- road construction immediately outside the hotel; this included jack hammers and cement saws at 3AM. The staff did an excellent job of re-locating us, refunding our room for the night, and refunding all parking fees for the entire stay -- however if we ever return to New Orleans, we'll likely stay somewhere else. If not for the road construction this hotel would have been a fair deal for the price -- road construction really ruined it for us.",
            "Stay here! The staff are top notch, it is very close to the French Quarter, but far away enough that you can have some quiet. The room we booked was upgraded (without us asking) for us and we stayed in a mini Suite with kitchenette, sitting area, bedroom area, both with flat screens and cable t.v. The breakfast was more than adequate, and the space very clean! Although it isn't an \"updated\" hotel, we were so comfortable there that we will always stay there when in New Orleans. Best part about it is they are not even aware of their #3 ranking of the best hotels in New Orleans (out of 148!) and were so humble to find out! Stan (the manager) greeted us by name EVERY time he saw us and made us feel at home! Kudos to the Quality Inn, it was well worth every penny spent!",
            "We stayed at Quality Inn & Suites for 6 nights first week of Sept/11. Booked direct on-line at the hotels website and got a great rate. Upon arrival we asked to be upgraded and were given room 210, a large front facing room. Beds comfortable, pillows smallish and ok but a full size pillow would have really helped our sleep. The room was large with 2 queens and a sofa and chair. Small fridge great for keeping water cold. Our only complaint about the room is the single pane windows did not keep the noise out, which was from the flapping of the flags hanging near the window. And flap they did during our entire stay as it rained buckets and the wind was ferocious. Staffs at the hotel are very nice and service focused. The morning continental breakfast is a notch better than most, and more than adequate although repetitive every day. We liked the very short 5 min. walk from Bourbon Street to the hotel which allowed us to leave the noise behind. We would stay again.",
            "I am originally from New Orleans and have visited back frequently. My GF loves the city and enjoys returning as much as possible. I've stayed in many hotels in New Orleans and with many travels. This hotel is definitely a top notch place to stay. You get exactly what you expect and more. They upgraded my room to a suite for no extra charge and because it was available. The free breakfast was great and filling. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The location is right in the heart of downtown New Orleans. The hotel is also located more in the CBD area vs the French Quarters. We felt very safe at night walking to and from the hotel. I am definitely staying at this hotel again. It's very good to know and experiences hotels like this one. Last but not least, the price was great.",
            "The manager and front desk staff treated us, and all the guests, like royalty over the course of our stay. During long weekend stay, the manager made reservations at 4 different restaurants for us, opened up the fitness center during off-hours so we could sneak in a late night work-out, and ran through countless city maps with us. Although the rooms were fairly basic the suites were very large and the maid service was always very on target. The location was one of my favorite aspects of the hotel. It was a couple of blocks into downtown, between the French Quarter and Garden District, and was walk able to all my favorite spots including Magazine Street, Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Du Monde, etc. And, due to its slightly off the beaten path location, it was cheap, quite and felt like a hidden gem. The unique, welcoming and very accommodating hospitality staff was like icing on a cake. Love this great find, and amazingly priced steal!",
            "What a find. We arrived at the hotel while there was filmiing for a movie a few blocks away (The Green Lantern); the movie crew changed some street signs around the hotel so it was a little tricky to find but it was worth the effort. From check in to check out everyone we met went out of their way to make sure we had what we needed and their suggestions on restaurants was spot on no matter what our parameters. The breakfast was presented very well, fresh and clean--the hot food was hot, the cold was cold. The French Quarter was two short blocks to Canal, cross Canal and one down to Bourbon--close enough yet far enough away from the tumult. Safety along the walk was not an issue. Very nice room with microwave and refrigerator and more than enough towels in the bathroom--not the paper thin ones either. These folks have their act together.",
            "I never expected anything as good as this.It was our very first trip away from Europe and i didn't know what to expect.I have to tell you now that none of the hotels i had ever been was as spacious, clean and comfortable as this one.The staff was amazing, extremely friendly and helpful.The location was absolutely perfect, just a breath away from the French Quarter. The breakfast was an absolutely wonderful surprise. I was used to continental breakfast consisting only of coffee, toast and marmalade but this was something else. It had EVERYTHING. Whenever i go back to New Orleans (and i will) i'll definitely stay in quality inn & suites downtown again.",
            "The manager, Mr. Stanley and his complete staff went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our vacation. Great 5 star service. I was given great advice on restaurants and local sights. We were allowed to check in early, about noon and our room was changed on our second day to better fit our requirements. The hotel itself was basic, no antiques or courtyards , but very well maintained. Great location, walking distance to the French Quarter. The`area was safe for walking, even late at night. Decent breakfast buffet, hot eggs and sausage or bacon, fresh melon and fruit along with your standard pastries and waffles. Well worth the money.",
            "They far exceeded our expectations! As soon as we entered the hotel, the front desk clerks and day manager greeted us warmly. We arrived at the hotel several hours early to see if we could drop off our luggage. They gladly took them and asked for our cell phone numbers. They told us that we could check in early and would call us as soon as they finished cleaning the room. They even gave us a map of the area and directions to places of interest. They knew the area well. About an hour later, (still a couple of hours before our check in time) they called us to tell us the room was ready. And that our room was upgraded! Later that evening, we wanted to go out to \"Mothers\" restaurant. \"Art\", (one of the manager/clerks) not only showed us on our map where it was , but also showed us the safest route. He was very informative and helpful in too many ways to list. The next morning, we were greeted warmly by manager & staff, had a delicious breakfast and the manager even called a taxi for us. Wonderful experience. Only problem we had was the internet. We were on the 7th floor and couldn't connect. We had to go to the lobby area to connect. But all in all, the best hotel staff we have EVER dealt with. By the way, the rooms were comfortable also.",
            "I have no complaints about the Quality Inn & Suites Downtown. We arrived late to the hotel and the manager on duty upgraded us from the double room we had booked to the queen suite. Sweet! The room was spacious with two TVs (one in the bedroom and another in the sitting area), a small couch and chair as well as a fridge, sink and iron and ironing board. The bathroom was clean and spacious. The shower had good pressure. The bed itself was comfortable, no complaints about bad sleep. There was no view but we also weren't in the hotel often anyway. The room and the hotel was very quiet. WiFi is available and the connection is on and off, but mostly sufficient if one just wants to check e-mail, etc. The staff at the hotel are super nice and attentive. When we were leaving, we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel until later in the day, and the staff called the taxi for us, which was waiting when we returned to leave for the airport. Breakfast at the hotel is complementary with the room - it's fairly basic and rudimentary (plastic plates, cups and utensils), but sufficient and serves the purpose. The location of the hotel is not perfect (perfect would be inside the French Quarter), but it's very close - about 7-8 min walk to Bourbon Street and the rest of the French Quarter. It was also safe at night - at no point did we feel unsafe. I would highly recommend this hotel, it's nothing fancy but it's more than sufficient if one is looking for a comfortable clean place to sleep that is close to all the attractions and won't break the wallet.",
            "Let's start with the location ... it's close to a streetcar stop and convenient to the French Quarter. How's the room ... it's comfortable and equipped with just about everything anyone could need ... a refrigerator, microwave, desk, sofa, iron and ironing board, and hairdryer. And what about the service ... well, it's fantastic! From the minute you walk in the door until the time you check out, you are greeted warmly and treated like family by the entire staff! When you factor in the delicious complimentary breakfast consisting of scrambled eggs, grits, freshly-made waffles, bagels, bacon, sausage, cereal, toast, juice, and coffee ... it's an exceptional value as well. It's really no surprise this hotel is rated #1 ... it's well deserved.",
            "We recently visited New Orleans at for the French Quarter Fest in April and had a wonderful time and a great stay at the Quality Inn & Suites on O'keefe St. Short walk to French Quarters, convenient to trollies and visits to Garden district, riverfront mall and six block walk to the new WWII museum. The staff at the Quality Inn always make it a joy to visit, they have a great full breakfast included and the rooms, while not fancy, are comfortable and serviceable with coffee maker, microwave, frig.in small kitchen area. Great for families on a small budget. Hotel needs some updating but for the money and friendly, helpful staff it can't be beat.. We went to the fest with a number of friends from our neighborhood and all that stayed at the Quality Inn were quiet satisfied with the rates and service. \"Can't be beat for price and service\"",
            "Only 2.5 star rated Hotel but with such accomodating staff, clean rooms and away from Bourban Street - it's a very good place to stay. A free breakfast with room, Checking in early was no problem and we even got a room upgrade to a suite. Once again thanks to Stanley and his team - this was real service, not the pretend stuff you often get in Hotels!",
            "We stayed here for two nights while visiting New Orleans. When we pulled up to the hotel, the young man out front was very helpful with our luggage and guided my husband on where to park. We found the rooms to be clean and comfortable. My son really enjoyed the bag of spicy chips left on the made beds. There was a microwave, refrigerator, and two tvs in our double room, which was really nice for my husband and son. The front desk worked with us on getting a room close for my sister-in-law. They also gave her a suite a no additional charge! We also asked them for an opinion on a bus tour and they not only steered us in the right direction (forgive the pun), but they also booked it for us! The hotel provides a hot breakfast, the location was convenient (we were able to walk to The French Quarter), and they had laundry facilities so we were able to catch up on clothes after being on the road for several days. What I really appreciated was when the hotel staff sent my son's writing journal back to our house (priority mail and at no cost to us) when he forgot it in the nightstand of our room. Overall, we found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The location was convenient and the hotel and room were comfortable and clean. We would definitely stay here again. A good value and friendly people!",
            "We picked this because of TA erviews and the Quality Inn did what it says on the tin. It was easy to find with the help of a SatNav (GPS), We were able to park temporarily outside to check in and offload luggage. We then moved the car to the secure parking about 100m away which was a valet parking arrangement. We didn't move the car for 3 days but there were in/out privilages for $17 per day. It was a one block walk to Canal and another 2 blocks to Bourbon. Even at night the walk felt safe. We even walked past John Malkovich who was having a fag on the sidewalk outside the Roosvelt (that's a cigarette to you Americans and Malkovich's lawyers!). Room was a surprise. Not much bigger than an average hotel room it consisted of two separate bedrooms either side of a bathroom and wardrobe area with a fridge and microwave. One bedroow had no windows so was a bit dingy. However there were two TVs and we were very comfortable there for 3 days. Staff were very helpful. Breakfast was good with bacon, eggs, waffles etc. Overall we were happy with the choice and in view of its location I think it's worthy of the TA rating.",
            "Hotel is very convenient location - a short walk to Canal Street (maybe 1-1/2 blocks) and then a short distance to Bourbon Street (maybe 2 blocks). My wife and I had a reservation for an economy room with AARP rate and requesting a quiet part of hotel. We arrived after 11 PM and the nice guy at the front desk, George, took note of our quiet-room request and searched for changes he could make to the room assignment. I think the hotel wasn't full and he upgraded us to a larger room which seemed to be in a good location. The next morning there was a very nice complimentary hot/cold breakfast buffet with most anything one could want including waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, yogurt, cereal, and multiple beverages. The staff seemed alert to diners' needs because, without my asking, they helped me first with my waffle and later with something else. I thought the price for the covered parking garage (about 1/2 block away) was a little steep but we had only one night in New Orleans and asked George if our car could remain in the garage until after room checkout time the next day. He said it would be okay, so that made the $17 (plus two valet tips) seem not bad. While checking out, I heard the manager talking on the phone with someone about discounting the parking fee but I didn't pursue discounting ours considering that we were able to leave the car in the garage after checkout time and because we thought the total overall cost of our stay was reasonable. We checked out around 11 AM and the hotel kept our bags in their office until we showed up with the car to retrieve them about 3:30 PM. The middle-aged fellow who helped us get the bags to our car seemed like a very nice fellow as was the manager and all staff we encountered.",
            "We stayed here as a pre-cruise hotel. The room was large with two queen beds. The beds were in separate rooms, each room with its own flat screen TV and a bathroom between. The breakfast was good and more than continental. The staff was VERY accommodating and friendly. The hotel is located about 1 block from Bourbon Street and Canal Street in the downtown area next to the French Quarter. The location is too far to walk with your luggage to the cruise port so I recommend a taxi which is $7 per person. The hotel staff was nice enough to call us a taxi. Without luggage, the walk is doable down to the Riverwalk, casino and restaurants at the port, or you can catch the streetcar on Canal Street. The only places to eat dinner around this hotel are in the French Quarter. We didn't venture out very late so I don't know how safe the area is at night. There is a Subway sandwich shop attached to the hotel but it closes early. If we had to do it over again, we would choose to stay closer to St. Louis Cathedral, Cafe Du Monde, Riverwalk and the casino. There are several hotels down there but I am sure the price is much more.",
            "My wife and I visited New Orleans for the first time and stayed at the Quality Inn & Suites for 4 nights. I chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor ratings and price; other than that I was flying blind and had no idea about location, etc. My experience mirrored most of the reviews on this hotel. We arrived at about 10am and stowed our bags so we could get around. When we showed up later in the afternoon the manager offerred to upgrade us into a King Suite which was very comfortable and spacious. Breakfast is included - has eggs, fruit (not just garbage), free internet, microwave, refrigerator so you can save money for splurging on more fun things. Every staff person we interacted with from top to bottom was polite and customer oriented. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from the French Quarter and a 10-minute walk to the St.Charles St. Trolley which for $3 takes you to the Warehouse district (museums), Garden District, and Uptown, so even without a car you can see a lot of the great neighbohoods without paying big bucks for transportation. This is a no frills place, some things are looking a bit dated, mostly clean, but with a friendly and accomodating staff, great location and a rate at least half of what most surrounding hotels are charging, if you are value-oriented and were planning on spending most of your time experiencing New Orleans rather than hanging out in your hotel room watching ESPN, staying here is a no brainer.",
            "We enjoyed our stay here. There were a few quirky things that occured such as the housekeeper kept taking all our soap (used and new) and would leave us with none. After the first 2 days I would get soap from the front desk and hide the unused one for the next day. Weird! During breakfast on the last day we were there there was an \"altercation\" between a staff member and another person who came in off the street. There was a lot of screaming and shoving, but the front desk staff came around to restrain their staff member and the other guy left. Again...weird! But it is New Orleans. If you need a place close to the French Quarter and other activtiesto get a goods night sleep then this hotel will meet your needs. It was clean and the staff were overall helpful.",
            "Was expecting good things from this hotel, especially after all the great reviews on Tripadvisor...and we were not disappointed. Arrived to the hotel at 8am after travelling overnight. Mike at the front desk apologised profusely for not having a room available for us but offered us free breakfast and to hold our bags. We availed of the breakfast, which was lovely and headed out to the French Quarter. The hotels location is great, less than five minutes to Canal Street and the French Quarter. When we arrived back to hotel our room was ready, comp upgrade to small suite. Had a small sitting area with separate TV , bedroom and small kitchenette with microwave and fridge. Like the other reviews, it really is the staff that made our stay. All are really friendly, helpful and always smiling! Breakfast is plentiful and better than other hotels. My husband was given a tray one morning to bring breakfast back to bed! The night staff are especially informative on where to go and what to do in the area. We checked out after 3 nights at around 5am, checkout was smooth and without asking for it we were given fruit and pastries to take with us, they even apologised for not having any hot items! The management should be very proud of their staff, some of the best we have come across.",
            "I searched and searched for hotels in new orleans, and after booking and canceling 2 hotels after reading the reviews on trip advisor. I read the great reviews on Quality Inn and Suites and decided to book there. The ratings were dead on the staff was friendly and treated you as if you were in a 5 star resort. the rooms were clean and comfortable, parking was only $15 per night 1/2 block away. location was close to everything. it was a great stay. will stay again.",
            "I didn't catch the front desk receptionist's name but he was amazing! He let us check in early and even upgraded our queen room to a king when he saw that I was traveling with my rather tall boyfriend :) and even apologized for the room not being too roomy so he made our parking complimentary. He was so eager to suggest places to dine and where the great jazz music is performed. We had a fantastic stay! The customer service was really refreshing since we didn't get much great service from around that area. Would definitely stay again!",
            "you cant beat the place close to everything clean and great customer service. we got there early and were able to check in with an upgrade to a 2 rooms. breakfast was awesome and plenty....we will stay there again for sure. thanks to Dada he was great",
            "Stayed one night....liked our room, breakfast, and location of the hotel. We stayed out late, and felt safe walking back to our hotel from Bourbon Street. The staff was friendly and very helpful in giving us directions to different places we wanted to visit. Although we weren't in town long enough to use it, there is a Subway restaurant connected to the hotel. Parking was also convenient (parking structure 1/2 block away with valet service). The hotel as well as the area was not busy during our stay.",
            "We found this hotel through tripadvisor, and the reviews did not let us down. A great value and the most incredibly friendly and help staff we have found in any hotel on our trip. The full breakfast was plentiful and tasty. The hotel was quiet, and just a block from the French quarter. If you are driving, make sure to ask about the secure parking available (for an extra fee) across the street from the hotel.",
            "I, being a member of the working class, know what it means to get a \"job well done\" from bosses and clients. I want to give one to Mr. Stanley Mascair, CHA, General Manager and staff. I've stayed in hotels and motels before and the service was adequate to bad. Mr. Mascair treated my wife and I like we were the only people in his hotel. The rooms are nice, comfortable and clean. Convenient parking and close to all the main reasons you visit New Orleans. Even if it isn't the most convenient location for future visits, we will stay there!",
            "Just two blocks from the edge of the French Quarter. A quick 5 min walk. No need for a car. Room was nice and clean. Bathroom looked to have been recently remodeled. Good water pressure. Got a free upgrade to a small suite. Breakfast okay but certainly nothing fancy. Best part was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Must have interacted with 5 or 6 different staff members and they were all great. Helped us with advice, directions and the exchanging of bicycles we rented from a third party for the day. They were very helpful and accommodating.",
            "I chose this hotel after reading the many positive reviews and was not disappointed. The location is great, quiet street but not far from the French Quarter and business district. As someone else has said, upon entering the lobby one afternoon, the man who checked me in greeted me by name! I was amazed! Another plus was the convenient and reasonably priced parking garage right next door.If you are in town for a few days,leave your car and walk or take the trolley around. The breakfast is nothing to write home about, but adequate, and can save a couple fifteen to twenty bucks that they would spend eating elsewhere. The room I had, with two queen beds, also had a sofa and chair for reading, a desk and chair, fridge and microwave. Overall a great choice for an expense-concious trip to NOLA.",
            "Stayed at hotel in December, on arrival everyone was very helpful, but as many have said the rooms are so old and outdated in need of an urgent refurbishment, the bathroom fittings are all old and worn, our friends stayed at the Hotel Monteleone in the French Quarter for less than we were paying !! How this hotel got so high in the ratings I do not know, breakfast was OK but what is annoying is there are not enough seating areas and this then spills over into a lounge area, when the tables are vacated they are not cleaned or wiped down by the staff who stand there watching. The area is not very nice, my wife would not walk round on her own during the day and I must say we were very uneasy at night looking over our shoulder all the time, lots of drunks around, New Orleans was not what I expected , Burbon Street now has sex shops etc and shops selling cheap alcohol which attract lots drunks. I would not stay at this hotel if I return to New Orleans...",
            "I found the motel on Trip Advisor and it was great!! If you drive you park 1 block away cost $15.00/day. Reasonable for NO. The front desk staff was extremely freindly. Very helpful to assist in making your visit great. Room was clean. We got an upgrade because it wasn't real full. Your one block from Canal Street. By a all day pass $3.00 on the trolly. You get to Trolley all over the city. Royal street is a fun street to shop. Bourbon street is 4 blocks easy walk. If you like sea food. Acme Oyster house is 2 block. Riverfront shopping area has good resturants. Oceana Resturant just off Bourbon. Ask for upstrairs. Quieter and alot of locals eat there. We were so glad we found this resonable hotel, great service, and walking distance to all the great sites. Pick this one. Enjoy NO",
            "This hotel was recommended by a coworker who frequently travels. I wanted to find a place in New Orleans where I would not get taken for a ride. From the minute we arrived Mr. Art was wonderful, honest, and took the time to make recommendations. The hotel is a short walk to Bourbon Street via Canal and just also within walking distance to Harrah's.",
            "Pretty much everything about this place was great. The stand out thing about this hotel are the staff - I could gush about them for hours! From the moment we arrived, weary from travelling and way too early to check in (or so we thought) not only were we checked in immediately, but also upgraded to a king room - we were not expecting this at all! From then on the service just excelled, we didn't walk past a member of staff without a greeting, a smile, \"do you need anything\" etc. All tours they will book at the desk for you, full breakfast (it's good!) and close enough to walk safely to Bourbon st without having to be close enough to here it at night (I've read in previous reviews about the area being a bit sketchy and \"ghetto\" - not the case!) Excellent, book it!",
            "To contradict the last review, we are in our 60's and never felt unsafe in this area of New Orleans. It's a great location just minutes from the French Quarter and the main stopping place for the Streeet Car to the Garden District. We were lucky to get an upgrade from the very efficient manager (Stanley), he loves the Hornets! and he can also advise on eating places etc. Also all of the staff were effective and friendly and the rooms were very clean. he hotel advertises a Continental Breakfast, it's more than that, Bacon, Eggs, Waffeles, Yoghurt, frest Fruit, orange Coffee, etc. etc. it is very good. Only one slight problem, if the people in the next room have an early shower, you can hear the shower running.",
            "I just returned from a trip to NOLA, and I was unpleasantly surprised by the Quality Inn. This isn't because the hotel was inadequate. Rather, it's because I chose the hotel based on TA's ranking system and expected something better. It isn't. On the plus side, it's reasonably well located, clean, has very friendly staff, and is well-priced. On the negative side, it is in desperate need of a make-over, the rugs are shabby, the rooms are dated, and it has almost no amentias. Also, the location is just off Canal Street in a very business-like district...no charm here. I think the problem must be in TA's rating system. I booked this hotel based on TA's recommendation, and I expected the #1 rated hotel in a city to be significantly above average. This isn't...it's just average at best. So, my recommendation to anyone thinking about this hotel is don't expect too much. It's a non-descript hotel in a non-descript part of the city that is reasonably priced. As for myself, if had known what the hotel was really like, I probably would have opted to spend more money on a nicer place.",
            "My wife and I drove from Tampa, Florida to spend five days with my brother-in-law who flew in from Boston. I saw the #2 rating on Trip Advisor and read the testimonials. Very accurate high rating. These folks can't do enough for you. The beds were very comfortable. They match or exceed the bedding in some of the fancier places I've stayed in. The hotel is very clean. Location is really handy to everything. You can walk to the French Quarter. It's very close to the trolley as well. The parking rate was cheaper than the other hotels I checked out. What a GREAT VALUE!",
            "This is the best Quality Inn I've ever stayed at. Amazing location, nice rooms, good breakfast, but the staff is the key. I've stayed at 4-5 star hotels that couldn't match this staffs attentiveness, friendliness and overall good character. Whoever's in charge of the HR, you should be commended. This is how every hotel should be run.",
            "I've been a bit lax in finishing my reviews from our recent trip to the US, but when I think back to this hotel, it's all good. We arrived early, and while our room wasn't ready, we checked our bags and parked the car with directions to Royal st (courtesy of Mr Glen running up to the lights with a map so we didn't have to walk back to the hotel). There was an away Saints game on and Royal street was shut off with a big screen and vendors cooking on the street. The sights and smells were fantastic. Welcome to New Orleans! When we headed back to the hotel to check in, Mr Stanley advised us that we'd been upgraded to a suite as it was the first room available. Nice! The room itself was spacious, and the a/c worked a treat. Oh, and our bags had already been delivered. We ate breakfast here both mornings of our stay, which was simple but tasty (love those waffles! ), and added even more value for money to what already was a reasonable price place to stay. It really is the staff that make this place. How many hotels remember you by name whenever you walk in and out? I would have no hesitation recommending this place to anyone.",
            "I had to go to New Orleans for a medical society conference and the room prices ranged from $150 to $300+/night. Plus all these fancy hotels have the irritating routine of charging around $16 for internet access. I got a room with a queen bed for $98 and on arrival they voluntarily upgraded my room to king stating that the queen rooms are relatively small and since I was spending a week there, they were trying to make my stay more pleasant. The staff was unassuming but very friendly and efficient, and they were genuinely trying to help and not pushing for tips. On check-in they handed me an internet cable free of charge at it was long enough to reach the important places in my room. The room was clean and the daily service impeccable (even though I don't leave tips). The shower was great, the towels clean and soft. There was an extremely quiet refrigerator in the room and a microwave. It took me 25 minutes to walk to the conference center but it was a pleasant walk and with a busy schedule that was my only exercise anyway. The front desk clerk also volunteered to book an airport shuttle for me. They also had a decent continental breakfast including some healthier fare too (eggs, fruit, milk, cereal, grits) besides the usual refined sugars. Overall I saved a bunch of money and did not regret it for a second.",
            "My husband and I stayed here after reading reviews here. We weren't disappointed! Everything from check-in to check-out was great. The location is great - only a few blocks from the quarter, but easy to get to via car (we had a friend pick us up in his car several times). It was quiet - there were some large air conditioning trailers across the street due to some construction on some water pipes, but it created some great white noise my husband and I didn't mind at all. Check-in was great. The manager, Stanley, is a joy. We arrived at 9 am, way before check-in. They held our luggage for us so we could head out for breakfast and get a start on our vacation. Our room was ready around 11 am, well in advance of the 3 pm check-in time. The room was great. You're not getting anything ritzy here - if you want that, there are so many other hotels up on Canal St. that will be lavish. The room was clean and functional. There was a fridge and microwave, which was great the couple of times we brought left-overs back to the room. The bed was comfortable. It was a bit small, but for what we needed it for, it was ample. The breakfast is nice for what it is. We didn't eat there every day, but it was great, and I've had much worse at other hotels of this caliber. Staff and general service were great. Finally, check-out was fabulous. Check out is at 11, but our flight didn't leave until 3:30. We asked to keep our bags locked in the back, but Stanley let us check out late, for no charge. We would definitely stay here again - it was a great value, a great stay, and in a great location.",
            "This hotel was my first stop on a two week road trip to visit my family and we only stayed at hotels in the \"choice hotels\" family. This one was BY FAR the BEST. I can't describe the level of service and hospitality staff provided us from the moment we arrived to the time we left. We arrived 2 hours before check-in because we wanted to explore New Orleans and they were soooo accommodating. They were able to get us one of our 2 rooms straight away and held our bags or the 2nd room, all while being so apologetic about not having a 2nd room available even though they weren't required to. At least two staff members helped us with recommendations and the layout of the city. I was most impressed with the gentleman who helped us with our bags. Not only did he take of our family of 6 bags, he also sat down with us and provided us with a \"his special map\" of the town. He sat down with us and hi-lighted places to go, eat and see. They could not have been nicer. The hotel itself was a short walk to Bourbon street and the French quarter, which was ideal. There was secured garage parking a block away that was reasonable priced. The amenities at the hotel were great, the room was impeccable and the hot breakfast was perfect. This is the only hotel I will stay at or recommend in New Orleans. You will not be disappointed!",
            "We're just coming back from a wonderful 3-night stay in New Orleans. From the moment we checked in, we were warmly welcomed by the staff and by the terrific day manager, Stanley. He and the front desk staff made sure of our comfort the entire stay and it addressed us by our names the entire time, which made our stay very personable. We checked in very early and when we were not initially happy with our view, Stanley got us into another room in minutes. Stanley offered us a free upgrade to a larger room the next day when one was available, but we decided that we were perfectly fine where we were. Free breakfast was a nice start to our mornings in New Orleans and the Quality Inn's location cannot be beat! We were within a few blocks of Canal Street, St. Charles Ave and Bourbon Street (and the French Quarter). We were also literally 2 blocks from the streetcar stops for St. Charles Ave and Canal Street. We didn't have to rent a car at all during our stay... cabs to/from the airport, walking through the French Quarter and streetcar to Magazine Street and City Park. We could not have picked a better hotel (especially at the price). Highly recommended for the excellent and accomodating staff and great location!",
            "Short walk will get you to all the action, and even walking distance to the stadium. We went for a football game and when they found out at checkin that we were cheers for the Saints, they upgraded our room - nice! One block away is a convenience store. Room has a fridge so you can stock up on some items for the trip. We only paid about 100/night, never needed a cab, breakfast was included and front desk was super friendly - can't go wrong! Would recommend to anyone. Fancy -no, but in New Orleans, who is hanging out at the hotel anyways? ?",
            "for an affordable, comfortable stay i would recommend this hotel,the staff make all the difference and though this is an older city hotel they went out of their way to accommodate us. i would recommend it to anyone and their comp breakfast included waffles and eggs, quite a suprise. great folk,great staythanks!! !",
            "My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in March 2011. We arrived after being in transit for 40 hours and were thoroughly looked after on arrival. The hospitality at this hotel is amazing and such a great location, only 5 mins walk from the French qtr.",
            "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay - nobody claims this to be a 5 star hotel - but the service lifts it above its relatively humble origins to provide an enjoyable, convenient, clean and comfortable stay. We really appreciated the friendly and helpful service and would definitely recommend staying here.",
            "If I had seen this place from the outside without reading its reviews, I would have passed it by. But I'm glad that I didn't. To begin with, the staff was very friendly and helpful. They take a lot of time with you when you have questions about the area. One guy even had an inventive way of opening wine bottles when asked. The rooms were very comfortable with a fridge and microwave. One person in our group got a mini-suite which gave the group a small sitting room to visit in. The location was great. We were only a few blocks away from Bourbon Street and a couple of blocks away from a CVS. Really, to get some rest at night, I wouldn't want to be any closer to Bourbon Street. Breakfast had good choices including some hot foods: eggs, grits, waffles.",
            "Great location. The hotel is old but that for the price, I wasn't expecting a lot. I was pleasantly surprised. The bed was comfortable, clean, bathroom spotless. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and made us feel very welcome. I would recommend this hotel.",
            "The manager here is friendly and very attentive. He remembers customers by their first names - makes you feel right at home! The staff is very friendly and professional as well. This hotel is very conveniently located to the St. Charles streetcar, Harrah's and the french Quarter. The room was very spacious compared to the small room in the upscale hotel I stayed at in the French Quarter for business.",
            "This hotel deserves its number one ranking and it is a credit to the manager and his hard working team. The location is very good, walking distance to all major sights in French quarter, the rooms were a good size and very clean, but what makes this place is the staff. Very personal service, we were upgraded to a queen suite which was a nice surprise. The staff were only too happy to talk about the city of new orleans, with tips on where to go, best resturants etc.. We booked a swamp tour through the hotel which was great. The best advice was to head to Frenchman st and avoid Bourbon to see the real NO nightlife. Highly reccommend",
            "Stayed here during mardi gras. The location is great for its price. You are a block away from the parade routes and the much more expensive Roosevelt is down the block as well. Front desk was friendly and helpful. They upgraded me to a bigger room at no charge and without asking. Breakfast is included in the rate, standard fare but does the job. The shower in my room was a bit slow to drain, I guess that was my only real gripe. The walls feel a little thin, so i'd recommend a room away from the elevator, it makes a loud beep every time its passing a floor. If you are a light sleeper, youre likely to be startled by it if you are sleeping near there. Furniture and stuff is a little dated, one of the drawers in my dresser was beat up, could use a renovation soonish. Overall, the location, the friendliness of the staff and the value make it for a good stay in a very expensive time of the year to stay in the french quarter.",
            "The Quality Inn is pretty much perfect for a stay in NOLA. The staff is great especially Mr. Art the night desk clerk. Nothing really fancy and no pool, but for the money exceptional. Clean rooms, fantastic staff, close to the Quarter and Mother's. Save your money on a room, stay here, and spend your cash out doing things. When we checked out the general manager shook our hands and said \"I know that you are leaving, but if there is anything that we can do for you please feel free to let us know.\" They are awesome and really nice people. They have high speed internet in every room, but I didn't take my laptop. No problem, they will let you use their computer in the office. The breakfast in the morning is simple but perfect to get your day going. I would highly recommend this place to pretty much anyone. If you are looking for a deal and don't need an ornate marble floored hotel stay here for sure.",
            "The location of this hotel is excellent (far enough away from the partying but close enough to the partying!) and the staff are super-friendly and always willing to help in any way. We stayed in a fantastic room (suite) and it was very quiet. We got a perfect night's sleep every night. The room was clean and comfy. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to others.",
            "My sister and I took a girl's trip to NOLA for 5 days. This hotel wasn't overly fancy, but it was exactly what we needed. The location is good, just a short walk to the French Quarter (but beware some of the streets at night - still a little sketchy walking). The thing that really made our hotel experience great was the staff. Special thanks to George at the night desk - the restaurants he recommended served the best food we ate all trip. He was freindly and straight-forward, genuinely helpful. An unexpected bonus was the room layout: One bedroom, then the bathroom area, then another bedroom with a door that closed off the rest of the hotel room. We didn't get a suite, but we each essentially got our own room. Great for one person who is a night owl and one who isn't. The beds and pillows were comfortable, and everything was clean. Outside traffic for one room and neighboring door slams for the other disturbed sleep some, but were reasonable and to be expected. Overall, a really good experience.",
            "I confess that I was hesitant to book this hotel since prior experience with Quality Inns did not lead me to expect actual quality, but I carefully read the TripAdvisor reviews and decided to take the plunge. I'm so glad I did! My husband and I, joined by two friends from Australia, enjoyed five terrific days and nights in New Orleans, based at the Quality Inn & Suites. We took a bus from the airport that deposited us less than 3 blocks from the hotel. The staff had selected rooms across the hall from each other and let us look at them before we checked in to make sure they were acceptable, which they were. (On the phone, they had said the room with two queen beds is small but it was much larger than they had described!) Everything - common areas, bathrooms, bedding, hallways - was quite clean and fresh smelling. The \"continental breakfast\" was extensive with eggs, grits, and waffles in addition to muffins, toast, fruit, yogurt, cereal, juice, coffee, etc. The coffeemaker in the room created an acceptable brew too. The location was great - one or two blocks to the Canal Street and St. Charles streetcar lines and easy walking distance to all of the French Quarter. Every member of the staff we encountered was gracious, friendly and helpful. Directions and restaurant recommendations were cheerfully given. And the price just can't be beat! I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone who does not require fancy accommodations.",
            "We booked based on the positive reviews and were very happy with the standard. As we are on a budget, we'd looked at hostels and cheap B&Bs but they all seemed to have a lot of negative reviews and difficult locations. The location of the hotel was excellent. In a safe area but just outside the french quarter. We walked in every day. It's also great as you can get a cab without getting stuck in the traffic of the French Quarter. Service was excellent. All staff were so friendly, all the time, ready to help and eager to hear about your day. Room was very clean and housekeeping came everyday. I would stay here again in a flash-BEST VALUE IN NEW ORLEANS! !",
            "I recently returned from a four night stay at the Quality Inn and Suites New Orleans. Upon arrival I was greeted by two very friendly staff members who not only got me into my room four hours before check-in, but upgraded my room from a Queen to a King at no charge. The room, while small (think NYC hotels), was clean and very well laid out. The room was equipped with a microwave, a refrigerator, TV, and a safe. The refrigerator came in very handy for storing left-overs from the huge portions served in New Orleans. The bed was very comfortable\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the pillows were awesome. The free wi-fi was very easy to use. The daily breakfast bar had a good selection and was always well stocked. The location of the Quality Inn and Suites is also very convenient. You aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t right in the midst of the party that is Bourbon St\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.but it is a very short walk (five minutes.) The Riverwalk/Casino area is about 3/4 of a mile away, but it is an easy (flat) walk. If you are going to a game at the Superdome\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it seems to be about \u00c2\u00be of a mile away as well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6again, an easy walk. Very close to the hotel are multiple little shops as well as a CVS and a Walgreens to stock your refrigerator during your stay. What makes this hotel truly special is the staff. Every single person I came into contact with went out of their way to assist me, recommended restaurants and attractions, and made it a point to wish us well on our daily journeys out and about\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and greet us with a hello every time we came through the front door. If I am ever fortunate enough to head back to New Orleans, I will definitely stay here again.",
            "We stayed at the Quality Inn for 3 nights and it was excellent in every way! The reviews we read on TripAdvisor were accurate. Our room on the 3rd floor was nice and a good value for the price. The location was perfect - 2 blocks from the French Quarter and the streetcar line. The General Manager, Stanley Mascair, and Janell at the front desk, took care of us personally with info. about the city and recommendations and maps for sightseeing. The breakfast is very good and was more than just continental. There were eggs, sausage and grits in addition to the usual waffles, cereal, fruit, etc.",
            "This hotel is great. It is right in the middle of downtown, walking distance to all the major areas (french quarter, riverwalk, Harrah's casino, jackson square). We had first booked a room with a queen bed, but the front desk lady said that bed would be small, and automatically upgraded us to a king bed with no extra charge. She also gave us a discount for the parking garage. The room is nice, clean and neat. It has a nice little kitchen area too with a fridge and microwave. The exterior of the building looks old and it can deceive people from booking here, but don't let the outside fool you. The price is reasonable too. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting to New Orleans."

            "This small hotel is nestled down a quiet city street and is convenient, affordable, and clean. As with most tourists, we spent the majority of our time outside of the hotel. However, we did make great use of our private terrace for a little happy hour before returning to the City for the evening.",
            "Good location, good rooms, perfect staff We stay at Hotel Grifo and really enjoy it.. The hotel is in a small street near the main street via nazionale.. The location was perfect.. Walking distance from the most important spots of the city! (5min from the Colosseum!!) Nice neighborhood where you can find very good restaurants, small shops, supermarket, etc.. The room was a little bit small but in the city center you can not expect more.. Comfortable beds and clean rooms.. Chamber maids very friendly, and a good breakfast.. The staff are super helpfull!! They will show you where to eat good food and give you good tips how to visit Rome! (Roma pass is a good deal!! ) We will stay again here on our next trip in Rome",
            "We spent 3 nights here exploring rome Jan 2012 & could not of found a better hotel for the price etc. Staff were helpfull , room clean, & heating was fantastic, had to turn the heating down as our room was boiling hot & for January in rome thats fantastic. Room was small but everything was there & after a days sightseeing we slept like a log. Roof terrace was a bonus. We recomend this hotel.",
            "This was by far the smallest hotel room that we have ever stayed in! There is barely any room to open your luggage. And the bathroom...the toilet seat was broken, which was taped together and the shower - you can stand in and that's about it...there is no room to move around (not even to wash your hair). If you are just looking for a place to sleep, then this will do it. There is no frills about this place. There is a metro stop near by, so that made it easy to get around Rome.",
            "We stayed at Hotel Grifo for 2 days before going on our cruise. Alessandro spoke very good English and that was a plus. He was full of information and gave us lots of advise on what to see and how to get there. The hotel rooms were small but clean and breakfast was included. That was great. Hotel is within walking distance to the Colesseum. I would stay at this hotel again if I am lucky enough to get to Rome again. Thanks to the staff at Grifo",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Grifo during our two week trip to Italy for the first time! We arrived and were immediately assigned a room but were moved without hesitation when we discovered our air conditioner was not working. We were very appreciative of the assistance as we were not used to the kind of humidity and heat! Our newly assigned room was on the top floor of the main building and while the hotel does offer a small elevator, we chose to take the twisting, winding stairs up to the top for the experience! It was fun! A little scary on the way down, but fun! The breakfast in the morning is exactly what you would want before a long day of sightseeing. They offered a nice variety and we always left full and satisfied. Everyone we encountered at the front desk was so kind and helpful. They were always genuinely interested in our day and wanting to know how we were enjoying the city. They always suggested the best restaurants and the best spots to have some gelato. We asked a ton of questions, always asked for directions and never once did they make us feel like we were a bother. This is a cute little hotel in a perfect location. Surrounded by tons of restaurants and within walking distance of some pretty amazing sights. You can't go wrong staying at the Hotel Grifo!",
            "The Hotel Grifo is wonderful!!! Their rooms are simple but exceptionally clean and spacious. The most impressive part of the stay was how resourceful, kind and hospitable the staff were. Everyone throughout the stay treated us like guests to their own home. I will surely stay there the next time I visit Rome. Kayte del Real",
            "The hotel's location is brilliant being a short walk from most of the city's most important monuments.. its in a quaint cobbled alleyway which give it the only sense of character it has. The staff are very friendly.. and when we forgot something in the room they kept it for us until our return to the hotel 4 days later which was very sweet of them. We did opt for private bathrooms which is great because the showers on some floors are on the other side of the floor.. and its not really what u want to b doing while on holiday. The rooms are a little small, but you might get lucky and get one with a cute balcony or one of the most spacious rooms. I would opt out of breakfast.. stale cereal adn a few bits of bread really wasnt my thing.. Overall the hotel is excellent value for money, close to town, pretty surroundings.. near the main train station and you couldn't ask for money for that price.",
            "As the first place I slept in Rome, the Grifo has a spot in my heart b/c from start to finish, it was a relief. We had never been to Rome for vacation, w/ all arrangements made by us. Hours of reading bad online reviews had driven us to spend more than preferable for our first 2 nights in Italy. Jalel at front desk spoke English. He and other Grifo staff were very kind, helpful, and on hand. I knew to dispense w/U.S. notions of room size for that amt. of money but it was fine, just slightly thrift-shop regarding the decor. A comfortable room, and bed especially. Some storage space in the closet, a clean, decent sized bath w/a tiny shower (tall, big or heavy people wd be vexed), and a pleasant breakfast room with a variety of continental choices. The Grifo serves the tourist trade but is tucked away on a side street and feels cozy to come back to. Colosseum and Trevi Fountain are @15 min. walk in opposite directions. A 3-block walk to the subway and 1 stop to the Termini. Numerous small charming restaurants in the area used by locals, some right on Via Boschetto. I cd imagine some whiny reviews about noise sleeping over the din of a street full of talk, laughter, and motorcycles (on a week night), but it didn't bother us; who cares if you're in Rome!",
            "Alessandro was a wonderful help. He was on the day shift, just when we needed advice, suggestions and directions. Rosa was also helpful in the evening. Their command of English was more than adequate. Our room was not huge, but plenty big enough to move around in. Hotel has a cosy little eating room for the included breakfast, one of the best we had on our trip. There is a computer in the adjoining bar area for (free) use by guests. Just ask Alessandro for a password. Location was great for walking or catching city busses. We recommend the nearby Carbonara restaurant. I\u2019d go back tomorrow!!!! !",
            "Concierge Alessandro constantly went out of his way to be incredibly helpful. His knowledgeable (and polite and cheerful) guidance about sightseeing is the best a tourist could ever ask for! The hotel is a great value! It's also very close to the Coliseum and the forum, as well as to bus lines that go to the train station and to much of the rest of sightseer's Roma. Would definitely stay again!",
            "My husband, myself, our 18 year-old daughter and her best friend stayed at the Hotel Grifo for three nights in July 2011. It was a great hotel. Very clean and the staff was very helpful. It had a beautiful garden rooftop that was lovely. Would definitely stay there again!",
            "This hotel is the perfect spot from which to explore Rome. It's on a side street, an easy walk to the Colliseum and Forum, and not too far from the subway. There are plenty of restaurants nearby for either a quick coffee or dinner. The staff was very helpful, and the breakfast offered delicious croissants. We were in the annex, just across the street (which is all that was available when we booked). Another time, we would choose to stay in the main building, as the wireless internet service did not reach across the street. But the room was clean, quiet and very much met our needs for our two nights in Rome.",
            "We stayed 3 nights. The man at the desk during the day really made us feel at home. He was very helpful suggesting to us what were the best sights and when they were the least crowded, what areas not to spend money because they gouged tourists, what restaurants were good, etc. We enjoyed just talking to him about Rome. The rooms are plain but we stayed on the top floor where there's a nice terrace. We'll stay here again if we have the chance.",
            "Stayed here 25/25 Nov 2011.More than happy with loction and ease of finding. Just off the Via Nazionale Staff very friendly.And helpful Hotel verry clean.Happy with room as I came to see Rome and not the hotel.Although I would say my room had the smallest shower in Rome. would say was I was not happy the 8 euro (4pp)city tax I had to pay when booking out beware. Check tariffs before buying from bars near tourist sites you could be in for a expensive shock! !",
            "We are a young(ish) couple from NYC who have both traveled extensively in Europe but had not spent much time in Italy before. After reading many of the reviews on TA, I booked 4 nights at the Hotel Grifo to conclude a 2-week trip across Italy as we felt confident that Grifo would be similar to the other budget-friendly hotels we had booked for our trip. Unfortunately the hotel left much to be desired & it was clear upon arrival that the website did a great job of marketing the only benefits of the property - such as it's lower out of pocket & proximity to Termini, which was a pretty easy 10-15 minute walk. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, I had a bad feeling. There was just something seedy looking about it that I can't quite describe. Although the man at check-in was more than cordial, I couldn't help but be distracted by the buzzing fluorescent lighting and overwhelming bathroom smell permeating the air. We continued up to our room which was basic but clean. The bathroom was smaller than any other we'd encountered during our 2-week stay in Italy, so much so that the stand-up shower flooded as soon as the water came on. Having arrived in Rome after stays in various properties over in Venice, Florence & Siena - we just couldn't justify 100 Euro/per night for a hotel that felt so creepy & decided it was best to leave. Again, the staff was more than accommodating when we told them we would be checking out the next morning. We moved on to another hotel in the area & couldn't have been happier with our decision. Like anything else, it is all about expectations and what you want from a hotel. I am fine with basic accommodations provided that they are comfortable, clean & safe and unfortunately Grifo did not give fulfill that role for me. I would say this hotel is at the low-end of the \"budget\" class - somewhere between a roadside motel in the U.S. and a youth hostel abroad.",
            "On an alley that is used as a freeway, it's noisy and dangerous to walk the area. The room they put us in overlooked the street on the main floor and when we complained about the noise, that goes on ALL night, they would not move us. You will have to close the windows and turn the AC all the way up to go to sleep. The rooms are tiny and bathrooms are tiny. You'll be lucky if you don't drop anything in the shower because you wont be able to bend over to pick it up. It will be all you can do to turn around without having your arm adjust the hot water flow. Ours had a broken mirror and a toilet flushing mechanism only the \"Beverly Hillbillies\" would be proud of. Breakfast was OK, but nothing to boast about. Doesn't anyone put fruit out anymore? The bar was silly and there was NO safe in the room we stayed in. The price was high for what you got but they would subtract 8% if you paid in cash.",
            "After spending several hours and reviewing several hotels in Rome for the time we were staying, I chose the Hotel Grifo and glad I did. It was convenient to all of the ruins and sites of Central Rome. Most of all, the staff were all very kind and willing to help us. Our trip was delayed one day because of the weather here in the states. When we called the hotel, they were understanding and told us it was no problem. They had air conditioning for summer and heat for the winter. They also had the nicest lani outside of our room that opened up and somewhat extended our room. I would recommend this hotel to any one looking for a place to stay in Rome at any time.",
            "I stayed at this hotel in a quad room /w balcony in May 2011. The room was spacious enough for the 4 of us (all women, ages 30-50). Bathroom a little small, but adequate. We had lovely views from the balcony and had the opportunity to eat lunch there one afternoon. The location could not be beat. We were just off Cavour near the Coliseum. There were numerous restuarants and local shops right on our street. We had breakfast included in our rate. They had cold cuts, yogurt and cereal. Not spectacular, but it started us off for the day.",
            "We reserved a quad room for 2 adults and 2 children ages 10 and 12. The room and bathroom are not fit for 4 people. The room is gloomy and dark. Air conditioning is not adequate and they turn the A/C off at night. The back door of the room opens to grungy industrial looking equipment and the bathroom window opens into a heating well. The stairs are inconvenient and the overall feel of the room is low class. The location of the hotel is good. I would definitely not recommend the hotel for quad occupancy. For the price, there are other options in Rome that will be better, we stayed in one on our return back to Rome.",
            "Stayed twice during our recent tour of Europe. Wonderful staff, especially Alessandro (speaks 8 languages) and Rosa. Quiet, cute, safe neighborhood - easy walk to Colosseum, Forum, and lots of other sites. Room spotless, great breakfast!! Very close to Metro/train station.",
            "This hotel needs a little sprucing up. The rooms are small, and the walls are all stained. The cupboards in the rooms have peeling contact paper. The bathrooms also leave much to be desired, you have to push the button on the toilet about 20 times to build up pressure to flush. The tv in the room also did not work for the entire 3 days of the stay. I repeated told the staff but they did nothing.",
            "Hotel Grifo was well situated about a 5 minute walk from the Coliseum. Quad room for family of 4 was adequate in size, but air conditioner was very little relief from the Roman July heat. After notifying the desk clerk of our hot room we finally asked for a fan which did help some. A/C in most of Rome seemed to be ineffective against extreme heat, so I don't think Hotel Grifo is alone, but temperature in the room was often warmer than on the terrace. Be forewarned if you travel to this hotel in July or August! Probably a much different experience in the cooler months. Breakfast was included in the room price and was decent, just make sure you get there early in the morning to ensure the best selection.",
            "My family booked this hotel for a week, what a mistake. We stayed one night and found a new hotel. The room was small, the bed was only 5 feet long and the matteress was only a couple inches thick. Also, the lamps were attached to the laws with duck tape. The staff was nice but our room was terrible. Hotel Ivanho was cheaper, cleaner, and located by this Hotel. Stay there instead.",
            "This is local to many of the sites but it's alot of walking regardless. I would return during a cooler month...it was in the 90's the entire time my son and I were there. I also recommend if you're running to i.e. sisten chapel --don't wait for the bus just take the taxi so you won't miss it. Rome sightseeing could easily take 5 days but 3-4 would do it. Luigei---you're best---thanks Cettina & Marc from NJ!! !",
            "The hotel is ideally located in the vicinity of Colosseo, Forum Romanum and other main historical attractions and also metro station is very close. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Yet,the rooms were a bit of a disappointment for me- they were quite small and basic (I understand these are old buildings), mostly what disturbed us was the dampness in the room and that the heating didn't seem to work properly for some reason. My parents stayed in another room on the top floor with a terrace and that room was better and warmer/no dampness. Rooms were cleaned daily and towels changed. The breakfast was good enough with rolls, croissants, cheese, turkey, salami, youghurt, cereals etc.- ok every day it was exactly the same (it would have been nice if they would have changed the variety of sausages etc.). Yet, concerning what price we paid (only 68\u20ac) it was value for money and I can reccommend this hotel for people who don't require too much luxury, but appreciate good service and location.",
            "My husband and I stayed at Hotel Grifo for 3 nights at the beginning of January. Alessandro was amazing! Upon checking in, he offered us tickets to an exclusive underground archaeological site that only opens for tours one month a year (and sells out immediately.) A couple of friends backed out on him at the last minute, so we were fortunate to be in the right place at the right time, and we went to the tour with Alessandro and his girlfriend. The location of the hotel is wonderful, down a little side street not far from the metro, which made it fairly easy to get to the main sights, though we ended up walking most of the time, as Rome has only 5 metro lines and there is so much to see between the stops. I found our room very comfortable and the size was not an issue. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and will certainly stay here myself when I next return to Rome.",
            "I take small tour groups to Italy in the summers and when we visit Rome we always stay at the Hotel Grifo. it is reasonably priced and the location is superb. It is close to the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona and many of the major sites in Rome. I love the neighborhood around the hotel. There are very good, reasonably priced restaurants and shops nearby. It is quiet, although it is close to several major streets making bus and metro access easy. Alessandro and his staff are excellent. They are very helpful and give lots of advice about good places to eat and shop. I have had to rearrange reservations for people in my group and Alessandro is always accommodating. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is good. I always request rooms with terraces in the hotel and enjoy sitting outside with a little wine and cheese. Many people in my tour groups have commented how much they enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Grifo.",
            "This was my third time in Rome, but my first time in Hotel Grifo. My boyfriend and I stayed here from January 19th to January 22nd, 2012. We booked through Expedia and paid a total of 162 Euro for a three night stay, which is an unbeatable price for the location! You can walk to every attraction, and take a night stroll around the Colosseum, which is less than 10 minutes away. After reading the reviews, I was a bit concerned about having a shared bathroom and about problems with the heating, so I wrote an e-mail and got an answer right away. They told me we would have our own ensuite bathroom, and that heating problems were already fixed. They're really nice and attentive, so if you have any doubts, e-mail them. Our room (122) was not as small as people say, perhaps we were lucky. It was a normal room, only the shower was tiny. We had a window in the room an another in the bathroom, both facing the street, but we didn't suffer any noise because the windows are new. The bed was really comfortable, and everything was spotlessly clean. Decoration was quite tasteless, but hey, we only went there to sleep. The only thing I didn't like at all was the door; it seemed ancient and didn't fit the frame, so you could actually see the room's ceiling through a strip from the outside. Also, the key was very old and key wards were inexistent, so I'm pretty sure it would have fitted in other door's locks. It's a small place, so you didn't get a sense of insecurity because nobody can sneak inside without people noticing, but being a woman I wouldn't stay there on my own. Breakfast was simple but nice; good coffee, croissants, cereal, juice, nutella, etc. I missed a toaster for the bread. Free Wifi is a plus, and location is so nice that I'd probably stay there again. But please... NEW DOORS!",
            "We arrived late and got a small room with W/C however the shower was not ensuite. We got the explanation that this the way it is with the basic room and went to sleep disappointed. Next morning asked Alessandro about the possibilities to change the room. He took it seriously, managed to get us another room in the annex (just in front of the hotel - very convenient), he delt with the problem in the most efficient way. The room was perfect. Ensuite w/c and shower included, WIFI worked well. Location is excellent, we walked everywhere even though public transportation is near (metro and buses). Breakfast was nice, many good restaurants around. Piccolo Buco near the Fontana de Trevi is an extraordinary place to eat. Above all, it is Alessandro that makes the Grifo a great place to stay. He was helpful (we got very useful hints that saved us time and money), efficient, intelligent and always prepared to help. Grazie mille Alessandro!! !",
            "But on this occasion - small rooms, even smaller bathroom (couldn't turn around in the shower), breakfast not worth having and to top it all off we had money stolen from our room. My wife left her purse in room for 15 mins and when we came back $400 had been taken. How do we know this... we had just counted our money as we were leaving that day. Only good thing is the location.",
            "We were welcomed warmly, pleasantly surprised to get a little terrace off our little room, and directed to the best nearby restaurant (Taverna Marin). It has an elevator, breakfast room, roof terrace, bar off the lobby, and friendly staff. Five minute easy walk to the colloseum. For an inexpensive hotel (for Rome) in a walkable, central area, it was perfect.",
            "We stayed for 4 nights at The Grifo Hotel. We really like this place. The location is excellent for historial rome and good for the rest of the central area it is also close to Cavour Metro station. The rooms are small and the hotel clean. The breakfast is good. A nice mix of national guests. All of the staff were suberb. Everyone from the lady who help serve breakfast to the reception staff were happy and helpful. The reception staff were excellent and we didn't need a tour guide after chatting each morning and getting tailormade expert advise on what to see, where to go and how to get there. Local restaurants - pizzerias, tavernas, winebars, indian restaurant good. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Thanks for our stay.",
            "Quite pricey for this small room. Old with mismatched beddings and moldy smell. Old rugs with broken closet. Fuzzy TV. Elevator is also very small which is very hard when you have big luggages. Only one hotel personnel would assist you. Although Rosa (hotel personnel) is very accomodating and helpful, I don't think this hotel has something else to offer. Some restaurants nearby but tends to be noisy during at nighttime. Accessibility is so-so. the hotel location is about 20 minutes walk to Colloseo. should you wish to go around and see Rome ,you can take the Metro which is few minutes walk from the hotel. From the airport, you can take a group shuttle to your hotel and will cost you less than 50 euro but it would take you more than an hour to get to your hotel. Because the driver need to drop off passengers to different hotels. If you are two persons and wished to take the Leonardo Express from the airport to Termini station then transfer to a cab to this hotel, it will cost you practically the same. Hotel is about 30 kilometers from the airport. Since we need to leave early from the hotel to the airport for our next destination, we have asked their personnel to arrange airport transfer solely for us. For regular hours charges is 50 euro and 70 euro for (10pm-7am) service. When we were checking out, all lights at the reception area were turned off, It was very dark,we can only see the light of their pc. The reception clerk didn't bother to open the lights much more didn't even bother to offer us a seat while waiting for our ride. He just took our key and leave us at the reception area without even speaking to us. Well, maybe he is still sleepy. He only showed up again when our driver knocked. He didn't say a word. That's what you call service?",
            "The hotel was very nice. A verry good location! Everything was near by and you can walk to the most touristic atractions. Around the hotels are a lot of nice restaurants and small shops. The stuff was verry friendly and helpful. And also the breakfast was good. So i can realy recoment this hotel to everybody.",
            "Toilet was used & unflushed prior to us arriving in the room !! Also the stairwell had no lights working making the steps very dangerous at night - we asked for these to be fixed on our first day & 3 days later they were still not working. Reception staff forgot to arrange an airport pickup so we had to get the train & when we arrived there was no help regarding places to go & how best to get around the city. There is no welcome pack or any info in the room not even any dialing numbers for reception.Breakfast area is not big enough to accomodate the guests so we were standing around waiting for people to finish & we never once saw the bar area open. The location is good however there are hotels nearby of a higher star rating for the same price. Would not recommend this hotel.",
            "The reception staff are so helpful at this hotel. They have great advice about where to eat and how to get the most out of your stay in Rome providing you with helpful tips. The hotel has a nice Terrace where you can sit and have a drink while looking over some of the surrounding rooftops. Its very clean and pretty central to most site seeing activities in Rome. You just walk down the road to get to the Coloseum. Great hotel and would definitely stay here again.",
            "The staff was very friendly and many of them spoke english very well. The room and shower left much to be desired by American standards (large people could not shower here). Great location near lots of restaurants and shopping, very close to the Collisum. Breakfast Buffett left much to be desired.",
            "My wife and I booked a trip to Rome for a quick get away. We didnt know where we were going to stay until we walked up a side street and into Hotel Griffo. The man at the desk \"Zorro\" was extreemly helpful and spoke good english. He helped us book a room and Rome tours. The breakfast was really great and the rooms were only 90 euro/night. They had wireless internet but wouldnt reach past the 2nd floor but did have a PC in the lobby we could use. The shower was a joke (16 inches x 16 inches) so if u drop the soap u are in a bind. But everything else was great and we would stay there again.",
            "Positive things: 1)The location is perfect for visiting Rome, close mainly to Colloseum, but also to every other touristic attraction by foot. Around the hotel you can find several terraces and a very good \"gelateria\". 2)Alesandro was very welcoming and helpful with all kinds of tips&tricks, he really makes the difference compared to other hotels and makes you feel like anything you could need he could find a solution or an answer. The chamber-maid was also very nice. 3)The breakfast I think it's a good one compared to Italian style with a particular good juice. Not so good things: 1)The temperature in the shower was fluctuating and became cold when you started to feel better after a tiring day (in addition there was no hair-dryer). The sewerage was very poor and you had to close the water during the shower in order not to flood the bathroom. This was the most annoying thing in this hotel. 2)The view was awful (we had a standard double room with bathroom inside, no 31) towards the inside part of the building with warped walls, kitchens from other apartments etc. Fortunately, Rome is much too interesting to spend the time in the room and we kept the curtains closed (though the room was quite gloomy). 3)Because of the limited space for the breakfast, we always had to wait for the staff to bring more of what we wanted to eat. There was always a lady that had to take r bring something in a quite narrow place. The croissants were never enough, especially if you came after 9:30",
            "We stayed there for two nights (April 24 and 25) and wish we had stayed for longer. Rosa and the folks there are great and helpful. The family room was large enough and the terrace was great. Great coffee with nice cold cuts and cheese plus yogurt, cereal, jams, and bread. The shower stall was very small and I am very big but I did manage so other folks should be ok too. The location was great. An easy walk to the Coliseum, Forum, Palatine Hill, Capitalone Hill, and train station. The elevator was small but not too small and worked fine. The area around the hotel is great for dining and relaxing with a wonderful gelato place right behind it. While there is wireless internet I did not get a signal in the room so I had to take my laptop down to the dining room.",
            "We stayed in the hotel's annexe - a small apartment for 2 nights. 'Shabby chic' would be a polite way to describe it and it was a bit of a walk from the main hotel - so it won't suit some people. For example, it would be a long walk for breakfast if it was raining. But for us there was beautiful sunshine so we enjoyed the little walk. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and found the staff friendly and very helpful with directions, transport advice, leaving our luggage etc. Breakfast was fine. Great location - lots of little restaurants and bars nearby and we started to feel at home in the area very quickly. I would stay there again.",
            "We picked this hotel to try and balance price and amenities. The rooms were small which we expected as it is Rome but well maintained. The location is good for access to much of the sites of Rome with good restaurants nearby and the rooftop terrace is a nice place to have a glass of wine or coffee. But the real value in this hotel was the superb staff with special accolades to Alessandro. With only one exception (the night person) everyone was polite, exceedingly helpful about touring and consistently cheerful. Plus the day and early evening crew all spoke English along with several other languages. We would recommend this hotel to anyone trying to maintain some sort of reasonable budget while in Rome and wanting assistance with the daily joys and sorrows of touring a big, unknown city..",
            "A perfect little hotel very close to all the major attractions of Rome. We loved being in the center of the city, yet away from the maddening crowds of the main streets. The great thing was that we could walk everywhere. If you did not want to, a bus stopped right in front of the hotel. Our room was small but sufficient, very clean, cool and quiet and a lovely terrace on the top floor of the hotel to enjoy the cooler evenings. Breakfast was enough to carry you over until lunch. The front desk and staff were very helpful, especially Allesandro who helped us plan our daily tours, suggested off the beaten path sites, ordered transportation and recommended a gem of a restaurant just up the street. When we return to Rome again, we will most certainly stay at the Hotel Grifo. Thanks you for making our Rome experience a great one! The Canadian family.",
            "The hotel was walking distance to everything we wanted to see which is what attracted us to this place to begin with. The room was basic but quite clean. The shower was tiny so fortunately we're average-sized people (but if you drop anything, good luck picking it up!). The pressure in the shower was very low and stopped spraying completely a few times. Breakfast was typical of hotels in Italy. The wi-fi rarely worked during our stay and only down in the lobby. The staff was very helpful and arranged transportation for us when needed. Overall, this is a good, no-frills hotel but the location makes the stay worthwhile.",
            "We had a nice four day stay at the hotel Grifo a few weeks ago. We were on the top floor. As discussed the staff were very nice and helpful. Room was a little small and I have a few minor complaints (the shower was tiny and the toilet ran) but overall a good experience. The private balcony on the fourth floor is outside of the two upstairs rooms and is open to anyone. Not a big deal but not the in-room balcony that I expected/hoped for. Great location and a stunning view of the coliseum after 2 quick left turns outside of the hotel entrance. Some good restaurants and food shops nearby, along with the smell of Indian food from the restaurant across the way which struck me as pretty funny in Rome. Didn't take advantage of the bar untli the last night but got a heck of a pour for 3 euros. Probably our biggest bargain in Rome",
            "We stayed here for about 5 days and can highly recommend this hotel. The location is brilliant. Walking distance form the Coloseum, Trebvi fountain, Spanish steps, Roman forum, etc etc etc. The only place we took a bus to was the Vatican, but it can be walked in 20-ish minutes if you are up to it. Nice roof terrace as well. No food or drinks up there, but get some wine and a pizza and it makes a fine place to relax. The staff were very helpful as well. The room was rather small and the shower almost unworkably small. Breakfast adequate but not great. This is however very minor things compared to what you pay, where you are and how helpful everyone is. I can highly recommend hotel Grifo. Not the most luxuruious hotel, but very good value for your money.",
            "The hotel is in the center of many Rome attractions that are within walking distance. The hotel staff were VERY helpful during our entire stay. They helped on many occasions in making excursion arrangements, taxi/limo arrangements, restaurant suggestions and many of our other needs. This willingness to assist was very helpful to first time visitors in Rome. I would recommend this hotel for both its location plus the attitude and helpfulness of the entire staff.",
            "I really liked it here. The location is superb, on a quite sidestreet, 10-15 mins pleasant walk through charming sidestreets to the Colosseum. Loads of well-priced, popular restaurants in the vicinity, no obvious tourist traps. Feels perfectly safe after dark. This all means you can spend a full day at Colosseum, Palatine Hill, Forum, etc, and walk leisurely back to the hotel via a restaurant without using any public transport, taxis, etc. This is what you want on holiday! It took us about half an hour to walk from Termini Station (which is about our limit wheeling suitcases.) It's probably 10-15 mins walk to either Cavour or Colloseo metro stations, which is why we didn't use the metro with this hotel. Negative points - small rooms. (Bear in mind at this price, you either get small rooms or a less desirable neighbourhood, with budget hotels in cities.) Shower room was down the hallway, which was inconvenient, even though was a nice size and only used by ourselves. Shower not always hot when expected. Also the the tiled floors and small size of the hotel mean noise travels, especially if other guests are inconsiderate. Service very friendly and helpful. Old fashioned hotel desk, you give them your room key whenever you walk out of hotel, always someone on the desk. Breakfast suprisingly good, and plentiful (self service.) Very clean rooms and public areas. In summary a well-run hotel. NB. A historical fact which may fascinate, stimulate or disappoint, depending on your viewpoint - this property was a brothel 30 years ago.",
            "This charming hotel provided comfortable and most welcoming accomodation during our recent 3 night trip to Rome. It is centrally situated in a picturesque area of narrow cobbled streets and ivy clad terracotta buldings and is only a short distance away from the Cavour Metro Station. Just a short walk around the corner and the Colosseum is in view at the end of the road! Everywhere was spotlessly clean and gave the impression that it was really well cared for. In our case, we had a \"basic\" room and, although there was en-suite toilet / wash basin, we already knew that the shower would be located a short distance along the corridor, because older buildings are protected by regulations. This presented no problems since it was for our own private use and we had our own key. Each morning, a substantial cold buffet breakfast was served promptly by 7:30am. This included juices, cereals, selections of bread, meat, cheese, yogurt and spreads. A limitless supply of tea and delicious coffee was also on tap. We enjoyed sitting outside on the upstairs terrace, surrounded bu plants and overlooking activity in the street below. The staff were, without exception, delightful - so friendly, helpful and we were sad to say goodbye. We would certainly return to this hotel on any future visit to Rome.",
            "We spent 4 days in Hotel Grifo and had a wonderful time. The hotel is minutes away from tourist attractions, shopping and a great resturant down the street from the hotel. Go out the door, take a right and stop at the corner, the resturant is on the left. wonderful food and staff. The rooms are small and the bathroom but no different then traveling anywhere else in Europe. We would stay there again!",
            "My mother and I had a great 4 night stay at Hotel Grifo. We had requested in advance that we would require 2 single beds and our request was met. The room was very clean and of more than adequate size. I was relieved that we could sleep well without traffic noise from the major roads. The hotel's location on a quaint cobblestoned side street was fantastic. The metro station \"cavour\" was a convienient 5 minute walk away. We used the metro as a lazy way of getting around the major tourist sites. Although the tourist sites could easily be reached by foot (Except the vatican).",
            "My daughter and I traveled to Italy (Rome, Naples and Sorrento) and stayed at the Hotel Grifo during our Rome stay. We had read reviews of many hotels before selecting Hotel Grifo and I think this research helped us understand that our room would be smaller and the hotel a bit different from a US hotel. With that being said, we really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Grifo. The staff was extremely helpful in recommending restaurants and confirming our walking path for the day. The location is great for those wanting to walk or use the bus to many sites. As other reviews have stated, our room was small (including a very small shower) but it was always very clean and comfortable. We were even able to use the WiFi from our room. The breakfast was also small but for us it was a great start to the day (especially with the friendly breakfast attendant Angela). For us, Rome was all about the sightseeing and having a safe and comfortable home base where we could utilize the staff for directions and advice -- and we received all that in Hotel Grifo.",
            "Our room looked nothing like the pictures. The lobby is actually across the street from the hotel room. It was the smallest room we had in Italy. The beds were very hard! We had our worst sleep here. The phone was out of service the entire 4 nights we stayed there. Every time we needed to use the phone, we had to go down 4 flights of stairs and across the street to use the lobby phone. Our room had so much dust. I will say that it is in a great location since it is near the Coloseum. There are also a lot of shops, cafes, and churches around it. The breakfast was okay. It was sweet bread, cheese and meat, and yogurt. If anything, stay here for the location.",
            "Just returned from 2 nights last weekend. The rate was reasonable, but the room was small and the bathroom and shower smaller still. There was no hot water in the morning and breakfast was poor. The breakfast room is so small, you have to learn over guests to get to the cereal! The staff are very friendly, but I will stay somewhere else next time I go to Rome,",
            "this hotel is located not far rome's major sites . and lies in a quiet street with lots of resurants near. the staff was very helpfull and friendly, they did everything they could in order to make our stay enjoyable. the rooms are clean and comfortable , though it's recomend to ask in advance rooms with toilet rooms, some rooms have joined bathrooms. because we where 3 we recieved a great room a \"penthouse\" with a great balcony. the balcony was the best feature of the room. the breakfast was suffciant. regarding the price the hotel is ok, slightly expensive, but it's rome. the hotel for some fee grants you premision to park the car in nearby streets. even though we payed for the parking we got a ticket. don't use a car in rome",
            "The service was wonderful as the staff were so kind and friendly. Our room was on the top floor and we had a view which was great. Our room also had it's own shower and toilet which is always nice to have. It felt cozy as well, like the hotel. The location is wonderful. It was close to the places we wanted to see and go to. The coffee, well the coffee is to die for and the food is wonderful as well. The only problem for us was, we walked to a bus station to go to somewhere we wanted to see and the bus no longer stopped there so we ended up walking a fair distance to catch the bus. Good news, we saw more things doing this.",
            "We had great time here!!! The location is perfect! 5 minutes from the Colosseum! The area is wonderfull!!! We love the restaurants and gelato place! The rooms are really clean, and the breakfast is good.. I love the coffea! A good start in the morning.. You can find different type of bread, cereals, nutella!!! Really enjoy it! Try to have breakfast on the terrace!!!! The staff? Awesome!! Helpfull and very good in giving tips how to visit Rome! And for the restaurants try \"taverna dei monti\"! Or \"la carbonara\"! Both are near the hotel.. Wi-fi is free but only in the lobby.. We will stay here again!",
            "Very friendly English-speaking staff goes extra mile for exceptional help to make the most of stay. Included breakfast offers generous buffet selections. A family feel to this 21-room hotel. Very clean. Elevator. Local area is not \"touristy.\" So, if you wish to practise a little Italian, this is the locale. If not, English is fine. Hotel Grifo-Roma is surrounded by quaint streets, shops, charming local cafes. Major sights are just minutes by foot or by nearby buses. For a 6-night stay in November we paid about what other hotels, within a half-mile radius, were charging for a single night without the breakfast or local charm and ambiance. One of best values encountered in Europe.",
            "We decided to stay at Hotel Grifo after reading excellent reveiews on TripAdvisor. They turned out to be true! The service was fantastic, perhaps the best at any hotel we've been to. The front desk staff were friendly, offered tips and suggestions, remembered our names and were generally always welcoming. The room was small (like any other in the city), but we comfortably stayed in a triple room. the beds were very small though; slightly smaller than a (USA) twin size. There wasn't much of a view, but the terrace was nice. Breakfast was good with a selection of cereal, bread, wonderful croissants and jams.",
            "If Joe Bradley had taken the Princess to the Hotel Grifo, there would have been a decidedly different outcome. Nonetheless, the Hotel Grifo more than makes up for what it lacks in glamor and panache with outstanding value and a superb location. From the tiny room on the top floor, you have a view, albeit narrow, of the Coliseum and the usual hodgepodge of latticework, rooftop gardens and clothes lines. \u2013 Romans tend to view their roofs as extensions of their apartments. Historic building or not, I was nearly on the verge of buying a bottle of Fantastic and a sponge and cleaning up the scuff marks all over the room. Although, to be fair, all but the most slender among us would be hard pressed to walk around the bed without banging into the wall. Initially, we balked and asked to see another room. The staff did their best to accommodate and offered to move us into a much larger room for the same price. We viewed at least three rooms, but decided to stay put due to the sunlight and the view. Our room felt more like a tree house perched atop the hotel than a regular hotel room. Reachable by a narrow and rickety steel staircase, it boasted a lovely balcony for morning coffee. Among the staff, Alessandro deserves special mention as particularly hospitable and helpful.",
            "Stayed here for 4 nights the week just before Easter. If you looking for a hotel close to ancient Rome this is it. Approximately a 10 min stroll to the Colosseum and Forum. To get to the Trevi fountian is about a 20min walk. (I'm a fast walker, but cant think it will take more than 30mins?). You can get the number 40 bus from close by to the Vatican. It really is so well situated and easy to get around. The staff were very friendly and helpful - even before we arrived and responded to emails very quickly. Very knowledgeable on the area - great suggestions on restaurants and sites. The free wifi is another bonus! In this day and age I dont understand why more hotels dont offer this. The hotel also has a terrace that you can use for a quiet drink at the end of a long day. If I have to give a negative it would be that we had probably the worlds smallest shower, but really thats nothing to complain about. The room was clean and comfortable.",
            "Location is great. you can walk to almost everywhere, and it's very close to public transportation so getting to and from the airport is easy. Price is unbeatable for a comfortable - clean place. Double-glass window provided very good sound insulation - very useful, since it can get noisy at night. Breakfast was ok for us (but expect continental style). The only downside was the size of the sowe cubicle: very minimum. We managed, but if you are average-to-big sized, it can get uncomfortable. Wi fi signal did not reach every room, but it was free!! (and there is always the reception if you got unlucky trying to get a signal) I would go back to this hotel anytime",
            "Stayed at The Grifo beginning April and can honestly say our first two days in the apartment block over the road from the hotel was awful, however and our last two days in the main hotel were much better. The apartment block across from the Grifo holds three hotel rooms on the second floor (no lift) of a private apartment block which is in the process of having its front facia updated, so is scaffolded and covered in sheeting. The room was TINY. It was really a single room with a double bed in it, which was really cramped. The room was dark with old furniture and a stained bed quilt and we had to keep the shutters and curtains closed due to scaffold and builders walking past our 2nd floor windows all hours. Luckily after two days there was a flood in the building, so we got moved to a triple room in the main hotel which was much better experience - light bright, could actually open our shutters and all round so much better. I would NOT recommend the apartments over the road, even when the refurb is finished. With regard to the rest of the hotel, we liked the roof terrace, and the hotel receptionists were pleasant. Breakfast was basic - untoasted bread and croissants - buy a toaster Grifo management - this is a basic breakfast requirement! We loved Rome and enjoyed ourselves immensely in the city and the weather and italian people and dining experiences were just great. Despite a great location near the Collosseum, based on our first two days experience at this hotel, we would not return. PS watch out at check out - the manager said we owed an additional 16 Euros in CASH no RECEIPT as we were Expedia customers for 'tax'. We insisted on a receipt, which he didnt want to do. What is this all about?",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Grifo in November 2010. As many other travelers have noted, the service is outstanding. The location is also wonderful - very close to the Colosseum, and within walking distance to many of the top sites of Rome. The breakfast buffet gets you ready for a day of sightseeing, and if you have any questions, the staff is very accommodating. I would recommend making sure that you bring earplugs, however, as the central location ensures that there is always foot and car traffic right outside your windows. Overall we enjoyed our stay.",
            "The staff at this hotel was extremely friendly, helpful and courteous from the minute we arrived handing us a map with great knowledge of the area to the moment of our departure. The location was superb, just an 8 minute walk to the Colosseum and 5 minutes walk to any form of transportation including metro and buses which is the best way to get around the center. While the room was on the smaller side it was always clean and adequate if you are not looking for a luxury stay. If you are looking for a place to sleep with various restaurants around with a small town feel in a big city this is the place for you. When I visit Rome in the future my plans will be to stay at Hotel Grifo. P.S. After eating gelato every day around various locations in Rome we found \"Il Gelatone\" Gelateria, less then a block away on Via Serpenti, to be THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !",
            "Great little budget hotel. We booked a triple which was a nice size and clean. The hotel is very basic, so dont expect bell boys, etc.. The guy at reception is super friendly and full of soo much good advice. You are 10/15 mins walk from main train station, but just 5/10 to the Colosseum or Piazza Venezia. The location is excellent, in a typical quiet Roman district! At the right price, this is a bargain and would book here again, no doubts! !",
            "This hotel was good value for money. The room was small but well equiped and clean. Although there was a problem with the toilet, Aessandro told us not to worry and it would be sorted out. When we got back from our morning sightseeing - not only had we been given a different room but all our baggage had been moved too. It's in a delightful neighbourhood, which has a lovely village-like atmosphere. There were a number of high quality, low cost resturants near by. It is close to the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona and many of the major sites in Rome. All of the staff that we met were extremely friendly and helpful. Definately would stay again!.",
            "Hotel Grifo was by far our best hotel experience in Europe. My husband and I have traveled all over Europe and found this hotel staff to be the best we have ever encountered. They were extremely helpful with information about the city, tours, restraurants, and transportation. The location is unbeatable, rooms were spotless, reasonable prices and a good european style breakfast included. Highly recommend.",
            "Our family of 4 enjoyed the quad room with the terrace (shared terrace but we were the only ones using it). We got a \"feel for Rome\" as the hotel is not a North American style hotel. It is in a quite area but not far from anything. We had a problem with our A/C during our stay and it was hard to get a repair man due to big vacation time in Rome. Hotel Grifo provided us with 2 fans and they also provide some compensation - the nights cooled down so it was bearable. Breakfast was sufficient, only suggestion would be to have some fruit. Staff were wonderful and helped with suggestions. We would stay there again & recommend this property.",
            "The Grifo is a very nice hotel with familiar atmosphere and typical italian charm! The perfect experience starts with a very friendly reception team, who speak several languages fluently and anticipate every wish! In our case, the reception manager even offered us a better room without any upcharge. The hotel itself is rather small, with a very familiar atmosphere and built in typical italian style. If you are looking for a real italian accommodation with charm and not a chain hotel, the Grifo is perfect for you. The breakfast is a small buffet with everything you need for a good start of the day: croissants, rolls, toast, cereals, italian cheese and ham, several hot and cold drinks,... again in a very nice and typical italian atmosphere. The location is just great, close to the Colosseo and within walking distance of all the famous sights in Rome. We will definetly come back to Rome and back to the Grifo. I can recommend it to everyone who is looking for a typical italian hotel with very friendly staff. It is a real insider tip.",
            "We stayed in the Grifo in July '09 and '10. It has become our hotel of choice. I cannot understand the damning reviews, which is why I have written this belated review. The Grifo really tries. It has an old world politeness and attention to detail The hotel is modest, welcoming and comfortable. In '09 we had a room with a balcony; it was lovely. We assumed this was standard, but it is a little extra. I have had better breakfasts at twice the price, but the coffee was excellent; the cereal could have been better. The breakfast waitress from Romania was the friendliest and most helpful I have come across. Rome has been a favourite destination for over 30 years; I have stayed in many of its hotels. Few can match the Grifo for its combination of location, value and facilities. In my home town, Aberdeen, you could expect to pay more for a lot less. There are many good eating places in the vicinity. The number of excellent notices don't lie. This hotel has a personal touch and goes out of its way to help the traveller and make a holiday memorable. Which is why we have booked again for July 2011 (this time with a balcony).",
            "This is where to stay and get the best out of your stay in Rome. Between the Trevi Fountain and the Collesseum. Everywhere in walking distance (even with a dodgy hip!). We are not seasoned travellers but the staff made all the difference to our stay. There didn't seem to be a language they could not speak, or a limit to the number of questions they answered. The basic room was small but very clean, the hotel was quiet at night (which as we are used to a small village was great), breakfast was plentiful and very good. All the staff's recommendations were great including the local restaurant.",
            "We travelled to Rome with our 20 year old son this spring. As there were three of us it was difficult to find a room big enough to accommodate all of us in such an expensive city as Rome. We were very satisfied with the family room at Hotel Grifo. It is actually two rooms with the bathroom across the hallway. This gave all of us some much needed privacy, and the bathroom really wasn't a problem since it is not shared with any other guests. Unfortunately the bathtub area ceiling was mildewed, but it should be easy to fix up. We also had a very nice balcony which was perfect for evening relaxation. The location is excellent and central. This is certainly a basic hotel, nothing fancy, but it suited our purpose very well.",
            "Found this hotel on the reviews. Was looking for something affordable, comfortable and safe in Rome. This was it. While the rooms aren't 4 star, they are comfortable. We also had a balcony overlooking the street, which was wonderful to sip some wine and relax. The hotel is centrally located to most attractions. Friendly staff.",
            "My family and I spent the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve 2011 in Rome where we stayed at Hotel Grifo. We picked the hotel after closely examining different hotels and their rating at Tripadvisor and we definitely made the right choice, This hotel has about the most perfect location in Rome I can imagine. The relaxing Boschetto street the hotel lies in and the surrounding streets are filled with great reastaurants (I can in particularly recommend 'La Taverna Dei Monti') which were easily found with the brilliant Tripadvisor Rome app. The area the hotel lies in is very cozy and really gives you the feeling of being in Rome with its narrow, slopy and cobbled streets surronded by fantastic architecture. Most of the top tourist attractions we visited were within walking distance and those that weren't, were easily acessed through the metro. The nearest stations is not far away from the hotel. The staff was very welcoming, the room was appropriately sized, the aircondition worked great as both a heater and a cooler of the room, the toilet and bath suited the basic needs and the breakfast was simple yet satisfying. We found the beds were a bit hard though but it was nothing that ruined the overall good impression of the hotel. All in all we had a great stay at Hotel Grifo and we got great value compared to price. We'll definitely consider living here again the next time we stop by Rome!",
            "This small hotel is located in the heart of Old Rome. Easy walking distance to the Colosseum, the Forum, Trevi Fountain and many other \"must see\" sights. There are some excellent restaurants in the area that the concierge will recommend if asked. The hotel staff are very friendly and are more than willing to assist you. The rooms are compact but this is to be expected as you are staying in a 300 year old building that was once a bordello (about 100 years ago). The facility is clean, the bed linen of good quality, and the mattresses are comfortable. It has the only triangular shaped elevator I have ever seen - really quite unique. If you have mobility problems make sure that you ask to stay in the main building, not the annex, as the main building has the elevator. You will still be faced with a couple of steps to get to your room, but it should not be an issue. The showers are small but functional. The continental breakfast included cereal, croissants, pastries, coffee and tea. In summary, the hotel offers a great location and good service at a reasonable price, just be prepared for compact rooms.",
            "I was there 2 weeks ago with my friend and payed a lot of attention to feedbacks before chosing the hotel. It's true: rooms are small. but we had what we needed, as they are clean, the breakfast is honest and at the reception we were given the best suggestions to discover the real Rome. Bravo",
            "I chose this hotel because of the location. Luigi and Alesandro on reception recommended excellent restaurants at very reasonable prices. Angela on breakfast was very pleasant and very efficient. It was lovely to be greeted by a happy, smiling face every morning before the slog of sightseeing! Breakfast was more than adequate: juice, cereal, yogurt, bread, cheese, ham, turkey and good HOT coffee!!! The rooftop terrace was a perfect opportunity to meet other guests and get their feedback. Our triple room (I was a mother with an 18 & 20 year old) was clean and the beds were comfortable.and flat screen TV with CNN! (no fridge,but other rooms had one) As a frequent visitor to Rome (twice a year for the last 15 years) I found Hotel Grifo to be the best. What it lacks in ****ratings it compensates with friendly, helpful staff, cleanliness and the quiet location! !",
            "We stayed 4 nights at the Grifo. The first night we were so exhausted from the flight that we could have slept through anything. The second night -- lots of noise from outside. Though the hotel is on a tiny street, it is pretty busy with vespas and lots of motorcycle traffic. The third night -- lots of noise from inside. The next room next door was listening to the TV very loud. Then there was some arguing couple at the bottom of the stairs. We didn't sleep well either of those two nights. The fourth night was fine -- I guess because we were exhausted again. The hotel's location can't be argued with. In 4 days we took the bus once and walked everywhere including back from the vatican. The bathroom is small but we are small people and the shower that many people seem to feel is very small is actually bigger than the one we have at home. The mattress is very thin but in two weeks in Italy at 4 places we never had a box spring. Next time, I think we will try for a quieter place.",
            "Monti is a \"little village\" in the middle of Rome, and there, in on of the charming, narrow streets, You find Hotel Grifo. On a trip to Rome five years ago we passed this lovely looking hotel and decided to stay there the next time, which we did in nov. 2008. On their website i\u00b4d read that the top floors had their own terrace and therefore i ordered one of them. Still, I hadnt actually been indside the hotel and therefore i coldnt be sure that the photos told the right story. They did. High expectations is a dangerous thing, but Grifo fulfilled our hopes for a romantic weekend. And more too. We felt instantly at home. The service was excellent and the room was very nice. We will stay there the next time too, thats for sure.",
            "Hotel Grifo was by far one of the best hotel experiences I have encountered in Europe! The hotel staff went beyond the call of duty and the rooms were spotless! The staff were very helpful with information about the city along with terrific suggestions on sights and restaurants. The Location was Excellent. They are only a few blocks from the Colosseum and within walking distance to all major attractions. Had a lovely time here ;)",
            "We spent a week in Rome at the Grifo hotel! It\u00b4s a fantastic little hotel in the middle of lovely Rome. You`ll get the most excellent service and as a bonus you can rest, from walking along daytime, on their green roof-terrace in the evenings. Every day you return to a clean room and if it\u00b4s hot outside, you\u00b4ll have AC inside.",
            "Great location, centrally located within the ruins we so wanted to visit. We stayed on the 4th floor. The room was large enough to accomodate us, although faintly moldy, and we had to purchase allergy medication in the nearby pharmacy on our first day to endure our spore allegies. When the terrace door would be open we would smell a natural gas escape, immediately nearby, so we kept it shut as much as possible. Other than that, and the minor city block-wide electricity failure (hardly within Hotel Grifo's power) we were delighted to be hosted by such wonderful staff as Louigie, Alessandro, Angela and of course our great Rosa, who took care of us even before we arrived to Rome.",
            "I knew that we chose the Hotel Grif because of its central location and affordable rates. The rooms were moderate to very small in size but clean. We ended up staying near the roof top deck which was the best part of the stay. However, we did have to share a bathroom with the rest of the hall--a very negative experience given that the cleaning lady banged on the door and yelled one time when I took a shower. They also are not too keen on those who choose to take advantage of the nightlife, despite the advertisement that it has a 24 hour bar. They were accomodating to some extent because they gave guests wine and beer from a 3 foot bench but that was only if we could summon the desk clerk over to assist. Our group checked out on time and the staff was basically friendly, especially at breakfast. The only drawback is that once we returned from our trip, someone from our group was emailed by the Hotel Grif and advised that he was being charged an extra 57 euros for a late check out and for not checking his bill--both claims are false and I believe he is contesting the bill. Overall, the hotel is family friendly and clean but I would not stay there again if given the opportunity.",
            "just back from 2 night stay at grifo went with my daughter so booked family triple room it's actually 2 seperate rooms so even better than i thought! ( roof terrace as well.) bathroom was spotless as were the rooms breakfast is fine cereal,coffee,tea ,juice, variety of breads etc. special mention to allesandro and rosa who were so helpful (had a very slight problem with a room key but taken care of while we were out )the cleaning staff great too! All the top sights are within walking distance(maybe not st peters but use the hop on hop off bus) no problems in a fantastic city and a brilliant hotel .",
            "We had a great four days staying at the apartment which is just up the road from the hotel, the hotel has got two great plus points, the location and the staff, the main gentleman Alassandro in particular was always on hand for tips and advice to make the most of Rome, in particular eating out. The apartment was adaquate and quirky, it's in a old cobbled street which has a violin maker opposite and a artist underneth, there is also a busy club next door so it was noisy at night. All this didn't effect our stay just a reminder that we were staying in a busy part of the city. If you want a central, cost friendly staff in Rome Grifo should be on your list .",
            "Hotel Grifo is a good hotel in a great location of Rome. Our room was simple yet very clean and comfortable. A very nice feature is the outdoor terrace on the 4th floor - it really is charming and relaxing after walking around Rome all day. In addition to being in a great location, the staff at the Hotel Grifo was the best ever! Everyone was so willing to help in anyway possible.",
            "We arrived and the staff was extremely friendly. We had arrived in Rome by plane around 9:30am and arrived at the hotel around 11am. The check-in time is not until the afternoon and they allowed us to check-in, drop off our bags, and wash up. This was gladly appreciated after 15 hours of travel time. Also, I would like to compliment the hotel on their complimentary breakfast. The coffee was great and they always accomodated us when we were early or late. The breakfast was enough to hold us over until lunch. Our linens were always fresh everyday. However, the beds are not to be desired but we don't stay in our beds very long on vacation. We get up in the morning and are usually gone all day. They have a few restuarants right around the corner that have the best pizza and customer service. It also is 2 blocks from the Coloseum and metro. They also have a change box down the street that gave us great rates when exchanging cash for euro which I recommend cause the commercial ones will give horrible exchange rates and charge commission. The last day the clerk called for a taxi for us. It was only 5 euro more than taking the train. We had a wonderful time and a lot of it is do to the great stay at Hotel Grifo. I definitely recommend this hotel as long as you don't care about the extra amendities. The staff was awesome. Oh, they also speak and write great English. I had emailed them a week before our arrival. They emailed me back promptly and understandable.",
            "We stayed here for three nights to start our week-long trip in Italy. The staff at the desk was always friendly and helpful with our many questions. Our room was the largest of our trip, with a fully functioning A/C unit. We never had any issue with street noise. The bed was a bit stiff. Unfortunately, we discovered this in all 3 hotels during our trip, so we assumed it was par for the course in Italy. Breakfast was ok, and also ended up being on par with the other hotels. It was good, nothing great though. The shower stall was also a bit tight (i'm slightly smaller than \"Average\"), again something we discovered in all of our hotels. Location wise, we were just minutes from the Colosseum and Ancient Rome. The neighborhood had plenty of charm and character. Many local restaurants and gelatterias to chose from. We never had any issue with street noise, and we always felt safe walking around. The Metro was also only a few steps away. For the price and location, the value was definitely there. We were pleased with our stay and would go back.",
            "My boyfriend and i were so excited to find our hotel located only 5 mins away from the colosseum- the reason we were so intent on visiting Rome in the first place! The hotel is down a lovely atmospheric street and is in the heart of the city, there are restaurants galore and so many things to see and do in the city so close by. Our room was basic but comfortable, had a great shower and was lovely to watch the world pass by out of our window. breakfast was good- you need it with so much to do and see during the day! The staff helped us whenever we needed it and were warm and friendly.We felt very safe and happy the whole time we vitisted the city and had just a wonderful time.",
            "Hotel Grifo was a nice, comfortable, clean & reasonably priced place to stay in Rome. The location is great, and 10 min walk to Colosseum. The hotel is on a quiet street in Rome, with several excellent restaurants within a two block radius. The showers are a little dinky as other people commented on, but after three weeks in Italy, they seemed normal! !",
            "My boyfriend and I are a younger couple and were traveling on a budget, and in Rome it is very hard to find a hotel that would not blow a hole in our wallets. But we were very lucky to come across Hotel Grifo. It is in the heart of everything and in a good area. The location is actually quite amazing! You can practically see the Collosium down the street! It is nestled in a tiny street where it is very nice and quiet. When we first arrived there (earlier than our check-in time), the man at the counter was very curtious and spoke English very well. He told us our room was already prepared for us and it was on the thrid floor, which is the highest. It is a smaller hotel but very cozy and welcoming. Our room was not the largest, but for two people who just need a place to sleep and shower, it was perfect. We had a television and a mini-fridge. The rooms are very clean and well kept. Everyday they make the rooms for you. They serve free breakfast in the morning, which was lovely. It included crossants, toast, yougurt, meat, cheese, juice, and cereal. Just enough to gather your energy for a long day of walking. The people that work at Hotel Grifo were all very friendly and helpful. They gave great recomendations for resturants and things to see. I would defintely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a pleasant and casual hotel room. It is really great for couples. It is no luxery hotel, but it is more than you expect for the price you pay.",
            "Grifo is a very cozy, friendly, clean and well situated hotel few steps from the coloseum. Among the three hotels we stayed at in Italy, Grifo was the best! The hotel is well situated in a very nice and historic neighborhood with restaurrants, pubs and places to visit. It is few steps from the coloseum and worth the extra you would pay in being a little further from the train station. It has a personal touch and you can see it in the care given to the place. The people at the reception are very very friendly and helpful! Last, it has interesting surprises, like a terrace in some of the rooms that makes you feel just at home!",
            "We spent two nights at Hotel Grifo after a two week cruise. The hotel is located within walking distance to top \"must see\" sightseeing in Rome. The neighborhood is friendly and safe. The rooms are small but very clean and adequate. There was a daily continental breakfast included in the cost of the room. But the most outstanding item in this hotel is the staff !! They were the most pleasant, informative and helpful of any place I have ever stayed. If ......when I go back to Rome it will definitely include a stay at Hotel Grifo.",
            "From the moment we entered this charming little hotel in the heart of Rome we new we had picked a gem. After registering, the clerk at the front desk took the time to go over the sites that we should see and marked them on a map (provided by the hotel). She also sold us a Roma Pass which was valid for 3 days, covering public transportation and free or discounted entry to Roman sites. TRAVEL TRIP: Buy the Roma Pass. We left our bags (the room was not yet available at 11:00am, no problem) and off we went. The Colosseum, Forum, and Capital Hill are all within easy walking distance from the hotel. Upon returning to the hotel we were pleasantly surprised to find that our luggage had been delivered to our room. We hadn't received this service before. The room was small, but comfortable. Even though the shower was small, it had the best shower head that we found anywhere in our 30 day adventure in Europe. The hotel also had an elevator, something a lot of the smaller hotels do not have. The hotel provided a nice breakfast to start the day off with; warm croissants, nutella, cheese, fruit, sliced ham and turkey, cereal, coffee, juice and milk. The hotel is located not far from the Cavour Metro Station, so it was easy to find. We found that the public transportation in Rome was excellent and bus 19 came right by the hotel's front door. Restaurants were plenty in the area and we found the area safe to walk at night. We would defintely stay here again!",
            "We had only one night to stay in Rome, and were looking for a nice clean hotel close to the sites in ancient Rome. This place fit the bill, but had a few drawbacks. Pros: * the front desk staff was very nice and had lots of tips for getting around Rome and making the most of our short time there. they also reserved a private car transfer to the airport for 50 euros. * it's clean. * close to Colosseum, but far enough away that you feel like you're in a real Roman neighborhood away from the tourist hordes. Cons: * way overpriced (150 euros) for what it's worth. i've stayed at a 5-star hotels for the same price. * neighborhood traffic is noisy at night. * ancient lock on the door opens with a skeleton key. doesn't feel very secure. * toilet operates strangely, shower door difficult to close. * thin walls - you can hear other guests walking up and down the stairs. We left early in the morning, so we didn't get to enjoy the breakfast. Maybe that would have made up for the other shortcomings.",
            "We stayed in this hotel one night, I higly recomend this hotel for budget travelers and families with children - it is in walking distance from Station Termini - about 20 min. OK - room was tiny, but clean, bathroom in the room, breakfast nice. Reception staff - very frendly, giving a map, trying to answer any question, giving suggestion for dinning.",
            "Location is absolutely perfect for exploring the historical center of Rome and even night life in Trastevere is just 40 minutes walk (through the illuminated historical center) away. The first time we got there we missed the right turn and in a few seconds ended up looking at Colosseum :) Late evening and night walks are pleasant and pretty safe. Right around the corner were tiny jazz recording studio, musical instrument's workshop and another small workshop where the guy was making copies of ancient roman clothes and armour. There also were qutie a few good restaurants (including cheap but very good Chinese and Indian if you're tired of pasta and pizza) and vinoteca around. Although it isn't by any means some posh hotel the staff were extremely receptieve to our needs and wishes like we were some VIP guests :) It was very helpfull for us that they were also very knowledgeable (Alexandro's tip about Vatican museums saved us hours spent waiting in line) and could speak several languages (including Russian) at least at some basic lavel. Although our room was rather small, it was clean and neat, the bed was very wide and comfortable and there were enough place in wardrobe for all our stuff. It could be a bit noisy - you're not completely safe from noise coming from neighbouring rooms and corridors - but at least the street is absolutelly quiet at night. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, felt that we got what we paid for and then some and therefore would definitely recomend this hotel.",
            "Great stuff (especially Alessandro... he is great, he speaks several langugages, he know where, when and how to explore wonderful city...). Good breakfast for that kind (star) hotel. Great place to start or complete daily sightseeing, lot's of small shops, restaurants... Actually, you don't need public trasport for lot's of sights... or dinner, or store... But, it's close to metro station on B line (one stop to Termini), close to bus station on Via Nazionale... From Termini station you can walk 10-15 min (well, Rome is on the several hills... :D )... 10 minutes walkign to Colosseum, or Forum Romanum... Clean room, fresh towels every day, small shampoo, AirCondition... italian TV, but TV :)"

            "My wife and I spent six nights at the Ca' Pisani in October, 2010. Our stay, in a word, was fantastic. We stayed in a junior suite which had plenty of space and my wife loved the bathroom. The art deco furnishings were a really nice change from the usual surroundings. The location, very close to the Academia Bridge, was wonderful and made for lovely explorations of the Dorsoduro. Breakfast was more than we expected, with plentiful choices and a sophisticated atmosphere. The best feature of this hotel was the wonderful and attentive staff. They were very knowledgable and helpful at all times. They made our stay a wonderful experience.",
            "I do not know where sydneyseasons stayed. It wasn't at the Ca'Pisani Hotel where we stayed for our honeymoon. The reception staff were multilingual, informative, and accommodating. There is free wifi, the breakfasts are plentiful (italian bacon, cheeses, cereals, fruits, yoghurts, dates, toasts and spreads, eggs, need I go on? ), the rooms are art-deco with great room service and a turn-down service. The restaurant provides great food which is well priced, and the bar is sensibly priced for Venice. We loved the turkish bath on the third floor - perfect after a day's walking around Venice. Different cultures WILL do things slightly differently and the Venetian way is certainly not the Aussie way... I would heartily recommend this to anyone who wants to see Venice as it is just off the main tourist thoroughfare but only a few minutes walk from everything and the service is awesome!!!!! Tip - avoid the gondolas - Incredibly expensive, and guaranteed not to be rowed by an Italian!",
            "Fantastic hotel. Fine attention to taste, design and details throughout. Excellent location, close to everything, yet slightly out of the crush of the tourist hubbub. This means it is quiet and relaxing. The employees went out of their way to help us in every way. The owner is a Masters Swimmer, as am I, and she introduced me to her Venetian swim club with which I trained.",
            "We stayed in this hotel for a couple of nights in July. It was very easy to find and close to a Vaporetto stop. The hotel itself was stylish with very pleasant rooms and cool air-con which was appreciated as Venice is very hot in July. Great location for all the sights - St Marks is within walking distance and the Vaporetto stop is just round the corner. Breakfast was tasty and the bar was a nice place to hang out before going to dinner. The Art Deco look was a bit different to your average hotel and made the place seem even more stylish and special. Would highly recommend this hotel.",
            "The hotel is located in a very nice spot near the Academia Bridge. The hotel is small and quiet, just away from the bustling part of the city. The staff was very helpful, recommending a restaurant that turned out to be our favorite dinner spot. The hotel appeared to be newly redone, an interesting combination of the old and the new. Highly recommended.",
            "My two daughters (ages 10 and 11) and I stayed at Ca' Pisani for about 5 nights in June 2010. The staff were remarkably helpful by email as I was booking our trip (they even researched hotels in Ravenna for us! ), greeted us by name upon our arrival, and recommended wonderful restaurants and destinations throughout our stay. In terms of aesthetics, the hotel successfully combines the \"old bones\" of the historic private home with very attractive contemporary art and design. Our rooms and bathroom were beautifully appointed -- though the \"sunrise clock\" was a little silly. The only downside was noise from the hall, though it didn't keep us awake.... Lastly, the location in Dorsodouro, just 1 minute from the Accademia, was perfect for our wanderings.",
            "This hotel has a wonderful location down a quiet street but a short walk from Zatterre and Accademia vaporetto stops. The bedrooms and bathrooms look like they have been recently refurbished and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. We ate in the hotel's restaurant La Revista on our first night and had a very good meal. The only slight downside was the lack of hot water. We stayed in room 19 on the second floor for 3 nights and were without hot water on two occasions. Having said this, the staff were quick to sort out the problem each time, and our friends in a room on the floor below had no problems at all The staff were always keen to help, ringing the water taxi company several times on our behalf to sort out departure.",
            "What a GEM! Ca' Pisani well exceeded our expectations all around. The decor is very sleek, contemporary with funky 1920's details dotted around this exquisitely-restored palazzo. Our standard room was spacious and bright, with super comfortable beds & luxurious linen. The wholesome breakfast was something to look forward to in the morning; and the stunning roof terrace was a great place to chill out after a day amid the madding crowds around St. Mark's Sq. The staff were great and informative, with Franco in particular who stood out as highly-efficient, dynamic and professional. During our stay, he provided us with exceptional service and always with a smile. This has made a real difference to our stay. In one instance, we had left it late to book our airport transfer but he managed to sort it all out and even reconfirmed everything on his own initiative. Such attention to detail and conscientiousness are rarely seen these days. Well done, Franco- you have made our stay at Ca' Pisani a true delight and we are recommending your charming hotel to all our friends!",
            "It can be a little nerve wracking choosing a hotel in Venice as the rooms can be small and the hotels a little weary. Ca' Pisani is certainly not weary and anyone looking to find excellent accommodation, convenient location and attentive staff should give Ca'Pisani a try. Our room was generously proportioned and there was plenty storage. TV and air conditioning worked perfectly. Exceptionally clean and comfortable. Staff were attentive and helpful and always acknowledged us as we passed. The owner Marianna, introduced herself and assured us of her attention should we require it. Such a refreshing change to meet the approachable owner and be assured that she was firmly at the helm. Great attention to detail thank you for a quiet and tasteful hotel. Oh, breakfasts were excellent by the way. Only improvement might be to supply tea/coffee facilities in the room.",
            "Ca'Pisani was our second choice but I am so glad we stayed there. The location just 2 mins walk off the Academia vaporetta stop was perfect. It was central yet not smack in the crowded area of St Mark's. Hotel room was actually decent sized for Italy and hot breakfast was a nice inclusion. Would highly recommend it for people who like modern furnishings in a convenient location in Venice. We stumbled upon a wonderful concert just across the bridge one night (Chiesa di San Vidal), which just added to our wonderful Venice experience. PS: make sure you get across to Murano esp. if you like jewelry!",
            "My wife and I booked a room at this hotel for our two night stay in Venice during our honeymoon. It is located 5 minutes walking distance (if that) from the Accademia water bus stop, very convenient. The neighborhood this hotel is located in is really really nice and cute and unique. Plenty of good food is located five to ten minutes away down the narrow walkways of Venice. The staff were very helpful (specifically, they printed us a map of the exact location of one of our dinner locations - this is very helpful in Venice where roads and passages are not clearly labeled or understood by visitors) and friendly and nice. If you want to be away from all the tourists and enjoy a few nights sleeping in a quiet yet fun and energetic neighborhood, this is your place.",
            "We went to Venice for a week in June for the opening of the Biennale, and also before it got too hot. We had never been, so we didn't know much but found this hotel in the Wallpaper guide and cross-referenced with trip advisor. The location was really good because you are away from \"the zoo\" at San Marco, and in between the 2 vaporetto stops of Zattere and Academia , so it gives a lot of ease to move around. The room was really nice ( a suite) , if a bit dark. Our landing on the first floor to our room had great decor as well, with an art exhibit .Breakfast, which is included, is really good and the staff is excellent and cheerful. You can eat outside, and people watch. It's a quiet hotel, with polite guests and a very helpful staff. If it had a terrace to lounge on, it would be the best. There is a roof top, but it's for 2 , and when we were there the same couple staked out their territory everyday.The only suggestion I would make is to not use the hotel to book your water taxis to and from the airport, as it doesn't give you better service for the extra cost of about 40 Euros per ride. I 'd go back to this hotel.",
            "My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. We were extremely pleased with the choice. The hotel is located in a beautiful and special part of Venice, and very close to the Academia bridge. We found the design to be modern and tasteful. The staff was extremely friendly and gave us excellent recommendations. We stayed in a duplex room. The one point to mention is that the stairs are narrow and not easy to use if you wake up at night, so consider whether you really need a duplex before booking this room. We had a wonderful time and i highly recommend the hotel, we would definitely stay there again.",
            "Excellent hotel, great service, perfect location! Had spent hours and hours checking out hotels in Venice for a 2 night stay for a 40th Birthday treat. Eventually through lastminute.com, booked via their 'top secret' facility (you don't know where you will stay until you pay thus receiving a discount in price). Ca Pisani had been on my 'possible' list so was pleased when the confirmation came through. The staff have an excellent level of service and so friendly. The rooms are immaculate with all the trimmings you would expect (and want) from a top-end hotel. The breakfast is fresh and more than enough with the addition of fantastic coffee! The location was a definite plus plus point. Having travelled around the city, we were so pleased we were in the Dorsoduro district. the hotel is a moment from the main water bus stops which is a must for getting around and for taking in the city from the water. (tip - do buy a travel card which lets you hop on and off boats at your leisure). Do go to Ca Pisani - you'll love it!",
            "I only expected the room to have a shower, as is often the case in Europe, but was pleasant surprised it has a very good bathroom with a bathtub and a nicely designed jacuzzi that is just right for my sore body and feet after walking several hours along the beautiful streets and canals of the city. The restaurant serves excellent full breakfasts, and their lunch and dinner menus are good too, if you prefer to be alone. The hotel is located in steps away from the Academia and 10 minutes walk to everything (the St. Marks Square, the Rialto, etc. ).",
            "As Venice has so much to offer we wanted a hotel which was convenient, friendly, not stuffy but which in this City wouldn't cost the earth. The Ca'Pisani was great - and since then I've also arranged for my parents to stay there too and they were equally enchanted. It's got a great location, stylish and good-sized rooms and common areas. The restaurant and bar is small but very good quality - modern Venetian food and excellent breakfasts. The staff couldn't have been more helpful (including sourcing wellies to cope with unexpected (to us) flooding). It's small enough to feel personal but not so small that it doesn't have all the amanities and to a high standard.",
            "Stayed here for the first time...will return to this hotel whenever I visit Venice. Small hotel with great staff offering good overall value. It's not cheap but you get good value for your money. I recommend this hotel for business or pleasure. BTW there's an excellent restaurant located opposite th hotel...one of the best in Venice...a 30 Euro menu to die for!",
            "My husband & I stayed at Ca'Pisani in May for 3 days to celebrate our 35th anniversary. We were very pleased with every aspect of our stay. Our room was very large-(I believe it was a junior suite) with the bathroom on the first level along with a sitting area and bedroom upstairs. Note for all that have trouble with stairs that though there are elevators to the rooms/suites ,there were stairs within some units so check before booking! The stairs were very unique-made of glass and artfully arranged. They were very interesting, a work or art really, but for me it was difficult, especially since the shower and bathroom were downstairs. Next time I will ask for a room without stairs-but most would enjoy the suite. That said-just for those with a handicap -(mine is invisable so they would not have known), I would definitly recommend this lovely hotel. I only wish we could have stayed longer. It was very convenient to everything we wanted to do, and yet set in a lovely quiet area that had a peaceful and safe ambience. The staff was very helpful with making arrangements for whatever we needed. We arranged through them a gondola ride-it was wonderful, and they made it very easy. (another note to my physically challenged friends though, be very careful while trying to exit the gondola!) There was a very nice breakfast buffet, and we also had a wonderful dinner at La Caravella. The resaurant was amazing-the food was perfection, and we really enjoyed the outstanding staff. I would highly recommend out this resaurant also. We had a lovely stay and would definetly like to return to Ca' Pisani. Venice was so beautiful that it overwhelmed me and made me cry at glance.",
            "The Ca Pisani is one of the best small hotels I have experienced. I stayed a few nights in room 11 and loved it: it was quiet, cosy, well appointed and large, with a wonderful bathroom. Since I am very much interested in Art Deco, I was delighted to see all the furniture pieces in the hotel. The location is good: you can either walk to the centre or take the water bus in the nearby station. In the neighborhood you have the Gugenheim museum, the Accademia (Accademia ) and several interesting shops selling art. The staff was frindly and helpful. This is definitelly a hotel that I can endorse and where I would like to return.",
            "I did plenty of research before booking our hotel for our 5 days in Venice and was not disappointment with our choice of the Ca'Pisani. It's a smaller hotel in a cute neighborhood away from the busy tourist area of San Marco square and the Rialto bridge, but within walking distance of everything. Plus it's a quick walk straight off the water taxi - which is important when you're carrying luggage. The rooms are decorated funky with an art deco style. It's also very quiet. There were plenty of other guests staying that week but we barely ever heard anyone. We also enjoyed the steam room up on the top floor and the rooftop patio every afternoon. There are no cars in Venice so all you heard were birds chirping. Before out trip I friended the hotel on Facebook and the manager, Marianna, immediately sent me a message asking for our dates. She was very helpful with any questions I had before we arrived so if you're going to stay there, I suggest you do the same. I would love to return to Venice again and would definitely stay at the Ca'Pisani again. And if you plan on taking a gondola ride, I recommend doing it at night. During the day the canals are end to end with tons of gondolas. When we did it at night, we were the only one on mostly every canal under a moonlit sky.",
            "Numerous stays at Ca Pisani only serve to reinforce my highest recommendation for the hotel - a warm, welcoming, and stylish homebase for your Venice explorations. The front desk staff is impeccable and helpful with good insider knowledge and the rooms are wonderfully comfortable and well designed. Plus your room rate includes free wifi and breakfast - so all immediate needs are taken care of. The location by the Accademia, with easy access to the central part of Venice, but removed from the tourist hustle-bustle. The new Punta de la Dogana museum, plus Peggy Guggenheim are steps away, and the Zattere facing Guidecca provides ample space for strolling as well as numerous cafes and restaurants. In short, stay at Ca Pisani!",
            "We stayed in mid October, we have not been to Venice before so I have nothing to compare to but we found it to be very well located. The decor is good the rooms are spacious and we had a standard room. My husband loved the blanket on the bed and has made me try and find one similar! Breakfast was varied and lots of it. We had a drink after dinner one night in the bar and where the only people in there and felt that the barman wanted to go home, its was only 9.30pm, however things do not seem to go into the night here, understandably as there is so much to do and see in the day. I must admit I didn't find the staff overly helpful, they where polite but no more. Overall a lovely stay in a beautiful place.",
            "It seems that in so called design hotels, you often give up friendly service for a trendy room. That's not the case here. The staff were wonderful and made all sorts of special arrangements for us that I know took them a tremendous amount of time. They couldn't have been more gracious and helpful. And you do get a trendy room! Rooms are beautifully designed, although somewhat small, and the public areas are lovely. It is one of those hotels where it takes me a day to learn how to work the lights, but that's probably just me. The location is great, in a quiet section near the Accademia Bridge away from most of the tourist traffic. There's a small restaurant with a very nice breakfast (included) that serves only light meals. You can sit at a table outside and enjoy great people watching. I'd definitely recommend it.",
            "No supposed four-star hotel should assign guests in their 60's, as we were in April, to a room ten yards from the reception desk and directly over a loud restaurant open early and late. The so-called mezzanine rooms are incredibly noisy and a good night's rest is impossible. We were moved to another room on our third night, but this room, too, was noisy.While the hotel had other positive features, our stay was badly marred by this situation.",
            "This hotel offers everything you need in order to enjoy a great stay in Venice. We had a junior suite adjoining a superior double room, as we were travelling with our two (almost) teenage children. The rooms , particularly the suite, were large, well appointed, modern, comfortable and clean. The lovely wide corridors of the hotel and the lovely roof terrace were fantastic. We had breakfast at the hotel which was exactly what you need and offered the full range, served by such friendly staff..faultless. The help from the main desk was exceptional. They offered to arrange whatever we wanted, but were not at all pushy. They arranged water taxis to and from the airport and fresh flowers for the room. Their recommendation for dinner on every occasion (three) were spot on and the restaurants were fantastic, and just the type we asked for with respect to quality of food, cost and ambience. The hotel is in a lovely location, far enough away from the main throng of tourists around St Marks, but close enough to walk there in 10 mins or take a vaperetto from the stop which is 2 mins from the hotel. The immediate surrounding area of the hotel is superb. I spent alot of time researching hotels in Venice, as I didnt want to stay in a cramped rickety hotel or one which you paid excessively for just because of its name. The hotel rooms do not overlook any canals so if you want that this is not available, but for us this was not the priortiy as we were out most of the day on the canals. I cant recommend this hotel highly enough, it is excellent.",
            "Based on Tripadvisor reviews, I picked the Ca'Pisani for a three day break with my husband and 10 year old son. What an inspired choice: I earned lots of brownie points from hubby for having chosen it! We had a junior suite so our son slept in the lounge area which was separated from our bedroom by sliding doors. A TV on either side of the doors helped enormously! Gorgeous real linen sheets, comfortable bed, thirties' style decor with an extra dash of panache, big jacuzzi bath, an array of buttons to operate the shutters and windows - all made for an excellent stay. Staff very pleasant, breakfast very good. Loved the baskets of apples in the corridors; our son thought was it very naughty to pinch one when we came back in the afternoons! Location was excellent; no more than a minute or two from the Accademia vaporetto stop. Would stay here again: a luxurious but relaxed hotel.",
            "This is a terrific contemporary/art deco Hotel. We stayed for 6 nites and were sorry to leave.The rooms were modest size but normal for Venice. Great bathrooms.Good breakfast served in their restaurant or outside under an umbrella. They have the best front desk staff that we have found in Italy...they are young, energetic and helpful, that includes Franco, Marco, Sergiu, and Georgio.They even made some dinner resies for us in Tuscany because the hotel there couldn't be bothered to help us!The location in Dosoduro couln't have been better. No canal view, but easy access to everything.",
            "We stayed at this hotel because it was the only hotel from the Design Hotel group in Venice, our room category must of one of most elaborate bathroom setups in the city, and the location sounded good. We are happy we did. There's a beautiful rooftop terrace full of chaise longue and potted herbs and we'd go up there at sunset and listen to the church bells. We were always up there alone, which has an uninterrupted view of the city on three sides and we had perfect weather. Tres romantic. We stayed in one of the hotel's duplex rooms, which came with complimentary non-alcoholic mini bar drinks, woo! Our room was fairly expensive, but there were lots of little perks and amenities at the hotel and the location was absolutely perfect for us to see all the Biennale shows. Very near the Academia Museum, Guggenheim and Dogana. Ca Pisani is totally recommendable. The only big Venice feature it's lacking is that it's not right on the canal and canal view rooms are pretty magical. I was in a friend's room on the canal on this trip and though I liked our hotel much better, their view was utterly romantic, beautiful and unique to Venice. Still, you spend plenty of time on the water in Venice and our view from our room was quiet and charming of the neighborhood outside.",
            "We stayed at this lovely hotel duing Carnivale and enjoyed our stay immensely. The location was incredible, right next to the Accademia and the heart of Venice. The staff were wonderful - helpful, courteous and professional. They had an amazing breakfast buffet that had generous hours to accomodate all guests. The rooms had nice touches, such as blackout blinds and hidden storage areas. The hotel itself is a work of art. Everywhere you turn, it is finished to high standard and aesthetically pleasing.",
            "Just got back from a wonderful weekend staying at the Ca' Pisani in Venice. Located just over the Acadamia Bridge on the south side of the Grand canal it's just far enough away from the tourist hourds but a short walk from most sttractions. We had a junior suite which was beautifully appointed, You could see that the owners had spent some money here as the finish was quality. I had a couple of small quibbles. One being there was no small table by the side of the arm chair in the small seating area so I had to put my drink on the floor. The other thing was the bed was a little too soft and the headboard squeeked every time I turned over. The bed, I presume an art deco original was a little too short for me or maybe it was that I prefer a bed with no board at the foot end, I found I couldn't stretch out. The bed linen was the best I'd ever seen in a hotel, beautiful. The breakfast was very good with everything I could expect and presented well. The staff were polite and helpful especially at the reception. I deliberately left some important sights out of my tour so that I have to come back again when I will be staying at the Ca' Pisani. Thank you",
            "Who would have thought that one could stay just behind the Accademia and be in a different world. You're literally in the heart of tourist Venice, but at the same time in the Venice of the Venetians. Sit outside for your breakfast and you will see the commuters from Giudecca walking from the Zattere ferry to the Accademia ferry stop with few tourists to be seen except those adventurous enough to travel to Giudecca. The rooms are eclectic and modernist, without being starkly modern, essentially they have a soul, and while there is sound from passing foot traffic this only adds to the Venetian experience. We found the staff friendly and helpful with excellent senses of humour, their demeanour was infectious and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We have stayed at a number of properties in Venice, and done our fair share of the full on tourist experience. This was easily our best stay, so close to all the tourist venues yet at the same time so much quieter and relaxing. You are equidistant from both the Zattere and Accademia ferries, so transport is not a problem, while this is an ideal location for investigating parts of Venice off the beaten tourist track.",
            "My fiance took me to this hotel for a weekend break. The staff were really attentive, the room was cleaned twice a day, and it was a treat to come back in the evening and discover a box of chocolate truffles awaiting us. The shower was amazing, and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was included and was very tasty. The hotel also has a turkish steam room you can request the use of which was a nice way to relax. The hotel is in very close proximity to Le Academia and Peggy Guggenheim Collection, as well as being close to a good selection of local well priced restaurants. Would stay here again if we go back to Venice.",
            "We enjoyed our fourth visit to the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pisani, this time for three nights. A key advantage of this hotel is its excellent location on a (relatively) quiet street in eastern Dorsoduro, beside the Accademia and about 200 m from both the Canale Grande and Zattere, thus with excellent vaparetto links. The hotel is a late 20c conversion of a town house but differs from many similar Venetian ventures as the interior has been completely remodelled in contemporary \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdesigner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 style and on the whole successfully. Some rooms are duplex suites with the bathroom and bedroom at different levels. Rooms and bathrooms are well furnished and are air-conditioned. Lighting is better that usual for Italy. Breakfast is an adequate but rather \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaverage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 buffet in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s La Rivista restaurant, which also serves high quality and good value light meals throughout the day. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful and the hotel seems carefully managed. There is free WiFi and a free public computer. Recommended, especially to seasoned Venetian visitors not on a tight budget. Tip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c try the nearby Agli Alboretti restaurant for excellent risotto options, accompanied by high quality wines by the glass.",
            "We stayed at this hotel for a week this November during the Biennale. Perfect location in Dorsoduro for anyone who wants to take advantage of all the art and music that Venice has to offer. Beautiful room, comfortable bed and wonderful use of space. Discovered that the problem with too much heat in the room came from the heated towel racks in the bathroom. After turning these off, all was well. Yes - mosquitos in November, but the weather was unseasonably warm all over, so windows had to be opened. All staff were courteous and friendly and very efficient. We will be back!",
            "Had discovered the Ca'Pisani through the wine and cheese bar several years ago and finally returned to Venice and stayed there. The hotel was lovely, our room was quite exceptional with a bathroom and a shower room and beautifully furnished and spotless [room number one]. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. It is in a very good location, next to the Accademia and it wasn't far to walk wherever we wanted to go.",
            "We chose the hotel Ca' Pisani for our honeymoon in Venice. The staff was very helpful with all of our questions, since it was our first time in Venice. We stayed in the Junior suite and wow, what a beautiful and modern room. The hotel is the first art deco hotel in Venice and just beautiful. The hotel is also in a perfect location...being just minutes away from San Marco square. Also, there are some great little restaurants and shops are all around. They offer the best breakfast in the mornings. Perfect location, friendly helpful staff, and beautiful hotel.... Thank you so much for everything!! !",
            "The service at this hotel is outstanding! It started with the prompt replies during the reservation process, continued great service from the front desk staff, the restaurant staff and the management team through out our entire stay. We stayed in the junior suite, the room is very spacious. It is a boutique hotel and has all of the comforts one would expect. The bed linens and lighting in the room were both fantastic. A separate jacuzzi tub in the bathroom is a nice amenity after walking all around Venice. The location is perfect! The hotel is located directly behind the Accademia. It was so pleasant to stay away from the crowds of San Marco. There are many good restaurants within just a few minutes walking of the hotel. The cocktails at the Hotel's wine bar, La Rivista are very reasonably priced and the staff are so very nice. The tables outside are charming and a great place for people watching. We had a wonderful stay at Ca Pisani and would definitely stay there again. Tip: If you plan on taking the Vaporetti to the airport from the Zattere stop down the street, please note there is direct service, however that service does not start till about 9am. If you have an early morning flight, you will need take the Vaporetti from Accademia to San Marco and transer to the line for the airport. Restaurant Tip: La Bitta restaurant about 5 minutes walk from the hotel through lovely quiet streets. The restaurant does not serve fish but has outstanding food and service, we went there twice. Make sure to have the fresh mozzarella and the vegetable crepes...outstanding!",
            "This was my third trip to Venice and I'd been a little disappointed by arrogant service and substandard rooms. No longer! Ca' Pisani was superb. Our room was gorgeous - lots of lovely wooden features, unobtrusive and useful bits of modernity and a terrific view over the rooftops of Dorsoduro. The location of the hotel was great and they very kindly arranged a (private!) boat trip to the island of Murano for us. The staff were knowledgeable, helpful and polite. There were some lovely touches to make us feel welcome - like the way they prepared the room for bedtime when we were out in the evenings. We were made to feel quite special staying here. Venice might be quite an expensive city to visit, but this place was terrific value and we had a great time.",
            "Stayed here for Christmas 2006. Hotel is easily accessible, being only 100metres from Zaterre on the water bus route from the airport. The immediate vicinity is quiet, but only a few minutes walk from Academia bridge, which gives one of the best views of Venice. Reception staff always extremely helpful, friendly and not overly formal. Helped book rail tickets and restaurants and couldn't do enough to help. We booked a superior room which overlooked the quiet street. The decor was as described on their website, contemporary with great attention to detail. The bathroom was nice, including jacuzzi bath, the only criticism of that is that it was pretty small, but very clean with all amenities. One of the best points of the room were the electronic shutters and blinds which could be operated from the bed and made the room completely blacked-out. The maid service was great and included a turn down service at night. Breakfast was served in La Rivista which is the hotel restaurant. Breakfast was nice - not the best buffet I have ever seen but perfectly sufficient and the restaurant is quite funky. Lovely roof terrace (bit cold in December but would be great in the summer!). In terms of location, it is pretty quiet and about a 15 minute walk to St Mark's Square, however we did find some nice local bars and restaurants which were much less touristy, cheaper and better quality than the tourist traps of St Mark's.",
            "Ca' Pisani tries to be a little different and it works. We had four nights here and found the room welcoming and comfortable. They have really tried to make the place special. Modern items like TV, mini bar and safe are built into antique furnishings; towelling robes and slippers are free; and the shower had a rather sinister looking handheld device for \"accurate rinsing :-)\". All guests were invited to a cocktail party on our first night by the manager. We only ate breakfast in the hotel and it was excellent - squeeze your own orange juice and a wide selection of meat, cheese, fruit, yoghurt and some hot food. The staff could not have been more helpful. I forgot the combination for my suitcase and after trying manfully to break in, the concierge was about to use bolt cutters. Then I remembered! The hotel is perfectly located within 3-4 minutes walk of both Accademia Bridge and Zattere. Both of these have vaporetto (water bus) stops. Once we found how to use them (very easy) we spent most of the holiday on these brilliant examples of public transport. Single trips are expensive (6.50 Euros) but 24- or 36-hour passes are good value.",
            "Interesting hotel, but some quirks that I trust have been worked out since our stay. Upon check in, we went with the bellhop to a room that had other guests staying in it already--it was an awkward situation. We went back down to the lobby and were reassigned another room, which was nice if not unremarkable. Later that day, we took some friends to see our room (they were staying next door at another hotel) and all 5 of us got stuck in the elevator for over an hour! After we were unceremoniously released from our prison, all we were offered was one beverage from the bar and a very terse apology. Mind you, this was in the middle of summer and it was disturbingly hot in there... We also didn't have a lot of time to spend in Venice and it took a solid chunk out of our stay there. Lastly, in our shower, the odd 'designer' soap dispenser that had no soap in it. We had to call to get it filled with some strange powder. Perhaps this too has changed since... Awkward moment when my wife had to wait in her bathrobe while staff came in to refill the dispenser... These quirks added up to an experience that was a bit strange and off-putting, but I wouldn't expect everybody to have the same experience--perhaps bad luck on our end. I just regret that they weren't as apologetic as I would have expected for the elevator mishap and didn't offer us anything besides a luke warm drink and apology. I don't know if it was worth spending the money that we spent, but it was an experience nonetheless.",
            "We stayed at this property in early July. The location, the beautiful rooms and the friendliness of the staff, this place was great. From the rooftop terrace one could hear the accordion player on the street below, it was something out of the movies.The location was just far enough away from the madness of St. Marks, on the south side of the Accadamia Bridge. Definitely will stay there again in the future. Paul D. Gaithersburg, MD.",
            "My husband and our two children came across this hotel by chance. They were extremely accommodating - wonderful with the children and very helpful. My family praised its cleanliness, modern design, and the substantial breakfast. Although somewhat expensive, my husband had looked at other hotels in the area and they did not meet the standard of Ca'Pisani and were either comparable or more expensive in price. It was the highlight of their 2500 mile journey through Europe.",
            "I say the Ca' Pisani is a small gem for three reasons: Giovanni di Stefani (the manager), the cleanliness of the entire hotel and the superb rooms. Mr. di Stefani gives a warm welcome, wonderful restaurant recommendations, precise directions and does it all without being overly familiar or \"in your face\": it was clear to us that our happiness was important to him; the place is impeccably clean: even the breakfast bar which, given their large variety of choices could easily become sloppy, was always appetizingly neat as were the rooms, the common areas and the elevators and lastly the rooms are a miracle of compressed luxury: beautiful appointments, jacuzzi tub, very comfortable beds and a phenomenal shower. I've stayed in much more expensive hotels in Italy but none better. We loved Ca' Pisani and can't wait to go there again. If you are arriving in Venice by plane and taking the boat go to either stop Zattere or Academia; the hotel is equidistant between the two.",
            "Service is top-notch. The staff is professional, not over-intrusive and both restaurants recommended were local eateries that serve wholesome food. The room size was big, nicely partitioned for luggage storage. We had one of the rooms on the top floor, and it was nice to have natural sunlight coming in from the rooftop, in the bathroom and also the luggage storage room. There was a kettle and free flow tea bags/ coffee on each floor, which is a nice touch; considering how rare drinking hot water is available in all the hotels we stayed throughout Italy. Breakfast is one of the most memorable part of the stay. The crossiants were crispy, cheese, bacon, ham were all fresh. Dining room at the basement was bright and spacious. We had a great experience staying here, and away from the main crowd from San Marco. Nice neighbourhood, great location!",
            "Stayed 5 days at the Ca'Pisani with my teenage daughter. Love the hotel. Had a standard room- was small but adequate. Bathroom was amazing. Twice a day housekeeping a plus. Staff was lovely- very accommodating. Guys in the restaurant recommended great wines for me while using the computer in the lobby. As to Venice, thourougly enjoyed it. We had a 7 day Venice Card pass, but note that most people got on the water buses without paying. Enjoyed meals in Ai Gondolieri, Cipriani (very posh), and local tratterias- esp. one near the hotel called Zattere I think. Very low key. The gelato near the hotel on the boardwalk was great too. Enjoyed the Caffe Florian - had lunch there our last day- listening to the orchestra- wonderful. Also, we hit Harry's Bar twice- yes, the prices are very high but you know that before you order. After all, it's Harry's. And suggest order the Bellini No.1- it's a bigger version of the regular Bellini with vodka and only 1 euro more. Highly recommend the tour of the Jewish Ghetto, whatever your religion. Doge's Secret Tour was ok, though our guide was good. Had 4 tour books and maps, but got lost everywhere. If I went right, I should have gone left. Interestingly, my daughter had a great sense of direction in Venice. Found some of the shopkeepers rude, but ones in the highend stores- Gucci, Hogan and Chanel were great. Saved a huge amount on shoes in Gucci (If you go, ask for Elena). Also enjoyed finds in small out of the ways places, including two in Canareggio- one called Fantasy Glass had the best hand made jewelry at the best prices. Another, near the water boat stop for Murano (Fond. Nuevo?) run by a woman named Lizette was also a find. Also liked the paper shop near the Guggenheim museum- she had the best prices we found for paper goods. Murano is hokey and a tourist trap but still fun. And, of course I bought a scarf, too!",
            "What a perfect choice for our anniversary visit to Venice. Our best hotel in Venice yet for our fifth trip. Really welcoming, nothing too much trouble, superb room & excellent (and large) bathroom. All beautifully presented and just where we wanted to be! Will definitely return on our next trip and hope that the only slightly off note of rather unfriendly breakfast service will have been corrected. Beware the use of the automatic coffee machine - ask for proper espresso!",
            "We spent 3 nights at the Ca' Pisani and loved it. Great location, rooms and staff. Could not have asked for a better hotel for our family vacation in Venice. Rooms were wonderful and staff very helpful. Great value for the price. Highly recommend and will stay there again on my next visit to Venice! Family of 4 from California",
            "We had a very nice stay at this hotel. The Staff was very friendly and helpfull. You have plenty of space in a standard room, very well decorated. The room was cleaned twice a day !!! We got a free bottle of Prosecco for our birthday, which was a very nice -and unexpected- gesture. The hotel is situated within a two minutes walk distance of the Accademia bridge over The Canal (and WaterTaxi drop-off). We can certainly recommend this hotel .",
            "A great location to get to from Accademia or Zattere, very easy to find. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful, our room was made up twice a day, the chocolate supply was great especially the Easter fish on our pillows. The design of the room kept the noise to a minimum, we were surprised to realise that there were 3 young children in the room next to us & we hadn't heard them at all. Interesting art books and a seating area on the 2nd floor were almost missed. Breakfast kept us going until the evening and changed slightly each day. There are some lovely bars & cafes around although we did find that places closed around 9pm. We enjoyed the food in the Taverna San Trovaso by the bridge (up from the gondola repair yard), and also the cheap Prosecco and cicheti at Al Bottegon Wine bar on the same side. The student area around Campo di Margherita was also a good place to people watch and enjoy cheap food & drink.",
            "We stayed here for 4 nights in July 2011. The hotel was unique and very nice. It was also located in walking distance to pretty much anywhere we cared to go. The staff was responsive via email prior to the trip giving detailed directions on how to get there. We arrived late and were given some snacks as the restaurants were already closed. The room was awesome. Very spacious with lofted log ceilings. The design of the hotel was amazing (it IS a recognized Design Hotel). I loved all the nooks and crannies around the hotel where you could relax, look at art, read, etc. (too bad we never had time to do any of that!). There was even a rooftop area where you could enjoy the weather and call down for food and drinks (we never got to do that either). The on site restaurant was very nice. We had good food for lunch and breakfast was included with the stay. I enjoyed sitting outside to enjoy my wine. The concierge was exceptionally helpful. He organized a private city tour for my husband and I. She was fantastic - she was flexible, intelligent, funny, and knew just about everything in Venice. I loved Venice and I loved this hotel. It was not overly expensive. I would definitely stay here again with no hesitation.",
            "We stayed at this superb hotel in May 2011 and constantly return to many happy memories of a wonderful experience. The high-quality interiors, customer service and ambiance combined to excel our expectations. Ca'Pisani was an oasis of style - art deco with a glamourous twist, filled with unique furniture finds and custom designs. The roof top terrace above Venice was a stunning place to relax and consider our next adventures through the city. We found the Dorsoduro area perfect for us, excellent art and music being within easy reach. We recommend the hotel and it's team very highly and shall certainly stay again when opportunity allows. John & Jen, Cornwall UK",
            "We spent 3 days at this hotel. The hotel is well located in Venice and convenient for using the water taxis. We had room 31, a large superior double. The bed was a little hard but adequate and a good size. The room was a decent size with views over the roof tops. The bathroom was a little on the dark side and had an unpleasant smell in the corner near the toilet which we mentioned to reception on our departure. The electric switches controlling the lights and blinds in the room were confusing. Breakfast was good with fresh fruit, cold meats, eggs, cereals, tea coffee etc. The service was friendly and prompt. The staff on reception were very helpful. Overall, this hotel is good value for money and it's position in the city, whilst not on the main canal, is excellent.",
            "My wife and I spent 5 nights at Ca'Pisani. The hotel is in an ancient building, totally renovated, perfectly clean and decorated with pre-40's furniture and fine modern carpets; the ancient volumes have been preserved. Our junior suite was large enough, and absolutely quiet. There is no view, our windows opened on the wall of the adjacent building; this is not a disadvantage in the winter when the sun raises late and guarantees a total silence during night; you may sleep there with open windows. Moreover, a canal view is nice, but it comes with the noise and smell of water traffic, which is a pity in a city without cars. Very well equipped bathroom : bubble bath and separate shower; no trace of the flodings mentioned in another ecent review : closing properly the shower door protects you froma private acqua alta. The reception staff is very knowledegeable and helpful, and advises you well on restaurants and shopping. The place has a small restaurant, with reasonably good food and a good selection of wines. The only weak point is the breakfast : service is minimalist, no fresh fruit juice as a standard proposition and the scrambled eggs are kept on a heating device and are overcooked. As a whole, an excellent experience; I would certainly recommend the place to friends.",
            "We really enjoyed this hotel. It is very modern. Our room was spacious and had two full bathrooms. The people at the front desk were very helpful. They gave a lot of good recommendations for restaurants. The only negative (which to some people may not be a negative) is that it is not on a canal. Hotels on canals can be noisy. This hotel, however, is only about a minute walk from the Grand Canal. It is in a great location. I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Venice.",
            "We stayed at the Ca' Pisani because it was within walking distance to the San Basilio terminal and we were leaving on a cruise the next day. We took the vaporetto to the Accadamie stop as directed but could not find the hotel at first, and I waited while my husband searched for it. This hotel is well situated for anyone trying to avoid the crowds in St. Mark's Square and it is close to the Peggy Guggenheim Museum. The walk to the pier takes about 10 minutes but triple that if you are dragging along luggage. It is a quick two stop trip by vaporetto and you can actually see your boat if you look along the canal. The hotel is small but very well appointed and very modern inside with all kinds of gadgets and gizmos to control things. Despite its size, the room was very comfortable and a quiet oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Venice. There is a place to relax on the roof overlooking Venice while enjoying a drink or just reading and wifi is available throughout the premises. The hotel is well priced for Venice and also seems to offer discounts on many online sights. All in all, a good choice for a short visit to Venice. A really nice breakfast buffet is offered in the restaurant downstairs and service is excellent.",
            "Stayed here for four nights in October 2011. Location was terrific. We had a duplex room - small living room area on the first floor and the bedroom on the second. Bathroom was well appointed. Breakfast was very good and the employees in the dining room were very friendly. Front desk staff was unfriendly. Not rude, just unfriendly and robotic. Since they are the first people I saw, it impacted my perception of the hotel. My several interactions with them, including checkout are what make this hotel 4 stars instead of 5.",
            "I spend 4 days in this hotel, and really is a good option in Venice. The famous hotels are really expensive, and this give you a great price (is also expensive, but is Venice, so....), for a design room. I had not been before in Venice so I think this is the best option for a novice. I suppose that in other visits to Venice y try to go to a hotel that introduces me something more in the venetian history. The hotel is designed like a modern one, then, when you have been captivated by the venetian atmposphere, it's is possible that you prefer a classic one. The worst of the hotel is the breakfast... very poor. The best: the hotel is in Dorsoduro, so you can go to a walk and discover the real Venice, where the authentic venetian people live. It's a very calm hotel.",
            "Wow, what a beautiful boutique hotel. My wife and I booked our 2 night stay in a standard room over the Internet and were quite surprised at how nice it was. The room had a huge queen bed with that modern, minimalist styling everyone is doing these days. Some cool features about the room: roll up blinds, venetian blinds, radio, and lights all wired up and controlled by switches at your bedside, oh, and the bathroom had to be one of the largest I've ever been in - waterfall style shower, side jets AND a handheld spray wand. Marble/limestone tile all around - just amazing. In the reception area, there are one or two computers with free Internet access. Also, the map which the hotel gives out is far superior to any of the other free tourist maps. Just ask the front desk. A few navigational things - we actually got lost walking around looking for the hotel so I'd like to share a few pointers. You can actually access the hotel from two vaporetto stops. If you're travelling through the Grand Canal, you'll need to stop at the \"Accademia\" stop. Once you get off the vaporetto, you should be facing the Gallerie dell'Accedemia with the Accedemia bridge behind you. If you walk to the LEFT of the Galleire dell'Accedemia, and continue along the street, you'll eventually hit Ca' Pisani. Alternatively, you can also get off at the \"Zattere\" stop (which is on the outside of the island) and walk to the right a bit, and then up Rue Antonio Foscarini (I think this is the name of the street that Ca Pisani is on). Some other things - the hotel is in the Dorsodouro area that the hotel is in is nice and quiet, and within walking distance of all major sights (~15 mins walk to Piazza San Marco - just follow the signs). Highly recommended.",
            "This is a wonderful hotel from which to explore Venice. Getting around from here could not be easier. Booking experience was great and staff very responsive and helpful when we needed to modify booking. Room was perfect - even for a long 5-night stay like ours. Plenty of stoarge space for clothes, suitcases and other personal items. Bed very comfortable, with quality linens, pillows etc. Even great coathangers - and plenty of them! Great bathroom. And we even had a view!! Breakfast - range and quality of food very good. All staff delivered service with warmth and professionalism. If we are lucky enough to make another trip to Venice, this hotel would definitely be our first choice. We loved our stay!",
            "No question this is the hotel to stay in in Venice. First and to us us most important it is very quiet. No noise whatsoever. Secondly it is in a great position between two water taxi stops. No view of water but as you get that all day it is not a problem. We had a standard room, 'small but perfectly formed'. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The decor was great - lots of Art Deco - and the hotel was spotless. It certainly passes the Would I Stay there Again Test? In fact we would not even consider anywhere else.",
            "This is a wonderful base from which to see Venice. The art deco interior is cool and fun and the staff could not be more helpful. It is just 10 minutes walk from St Mark's Square, a stone's throw from L'Accademia and Zettare vaporetto stops, yet is on the quieter side of a very busy town. It has a simple but good restaurant and once again the service is truly excellent. The rooms are large, wonderfully furnished, and a great change from most other hotels around the world. Amazing bathrooms. If we go back to Venice we will stay there again. Nothing could be better.",
            "My husband and I have been to Venice many times and decided to stay in an area we have not explored. The Ca' Pisani Hotel in the Dursoduro area is easily reached by water bus/taxi from the airport - just a few minutes walk from the Zattere stop. The hotel is close to the Accademia museum and bridge. The hotel isn't the usual musty Venetian style but rather art deco and modern in decor. The small restaurant downstairs was excellent for dinner and had more than an adequate breakfast. We were very pleased to find this small and pleasant hotel and would stay there again. We appreciate the reviewers comments on Trip Advisor's site. Thank you - Travelers from Amelia Island, FL.",
            "Ca' Pisani is a very nice hotel. We stayed in a superior room, which was pleasant and spacious. The people at the desk are friendly and helpful (we wanted pizza in the room one night, so they pointed me to a good place that did take-away and then gave us plates and cutlery). The air conditioning was good the bed was fine and there were curtains and electric shades and electric Venetian blinds so the room was quite dark enough. There were lots of available electrical outlets, a rarity. Aside from breakfast (which was fine, though the servers seemed constantly overwhelmed, even when there were few people), there is no real food to be had in the hotel. Overall, I think everything is attractive, but sometimes overdesigned. There were probably 25 things that looked like light switches, but only about half of them were (several were for the electric window coverings). The door handles were beautiful, but the Do Not Disturb signs don't fit over them. The shower has 4 different controls for a total of 6 showerheads and a handheld sprayer. The desk was interesting-looking, but not functional. Nothing really bad, just minor annoyances. The location is terrific and a big part of the appeal. It's an easy walk to most of the sites and it's convenient to multiple water bus lines. It is also in a quiet, pleasant neighborhood, with very little tourist traffic and a great waterfront walk with restaurants and gelato places within a couple of blocks, and there's a nice supermarket about 10 minutes away. This is a major relief from the hoards of people in Venice during the summer.",
            "I was very excited to stay at this hotel after reading many reviews, and I agree with all of its strong points. The staff at the desk were excellent; they all seem to be willing to answer our questions, help us make dinner reservations, and find our way around. The location was perfect: both in regards to access from the water transportation and for walking to many excellent sights that were nearby. It was also blissfully quiet, a real asset on such a busy weekend. The breakfast was fine, and the bar a pleasant place for a before or after-dinner drink. Unfortunately, we didn't get the opportunity to eat dinner there. One thing that was very disappointing to me was that our room was overly warm, \"stuffy\" being the most apt description I can think of. The first night I called the desk to see how we could turn on the air conditioning, and I was told that it was something that was controlled centrally, not in our individual rooms. So we opened the windows wide, turned on the bathroom fan, and managed to be comfortable, except for battling a few mosquitos. On subsequent days we tried to keep the sun out during the afternoons so that we didn't return to such a warm room. The first day, the housekeeping staff opened them; the second, my husband didn't put the blinds down properly. Every day, trying to make the temperature in the room comfortable became our endeavor. In short, I didn't expect this to be an issue in a hotel of this standard. Coming home with mosquito bites is okay for a camping trip, not for a stay in a pricey hotel.",
            "C\u00c3\u00a0 Pisani is an elegant and cosy hotel located in one of the best part of Venice. The atmosphere is warm, modern with a great attention to details. The rooms are characterized by a beautiful interior design, as all as the rest of the Hotel (lobby, restaurant, main floor). It's without any doubts an higlt quality hotel !! Great service, professional staff and excellent restaurant.",
            "This small hotel is located in the relatively quiet Dosoduro section with easy access to 2 vaporetto stops: Zattere and Accademia. Our room, number 25, was small but comfortable with good air conditioning. We liked the modern (1930's) design but the period headboard squeaked and groaned loudly when anyone sat up in bed and the light for reading was not adequate in the area set aside for chairs. The staff was very friendly and helpful, getting us tickets to a nearby concert of music by Vivaldi in Chiesa San Vidal and restaurant reservations. The on-site restaurant La Revista offered a very nice breakfast buffet (the best we had in Europe) and the wine and cheese bar had a wonderful if limited selection of menu items. After a large lunch one day, in the evening we stopped in La Revista where I had a selection of 5 local cheeses that was superb. We would definitely stay at Ca' Pisani again on our next rip to Venice.",
            "We stumbled into this unusual but well located hotel, when looking for an alternative to the pensione we had booked. The manager was charming and so helpful, we moved in straight away. To our delight, we found that all the staff were blessed with similar people skills . The rooms were very comfortable albeit designed for a business clientele. I'm sure the rooms were ultra modern about 10 years ago. In some ways this modernity just makes old Venice seem more alluring. We would definitely stay here again, especially as it is right next door to the Accademia.",
            "This hotel was wonderful! The staff was warm, helpful, and wonderful! We were two women traveling together and when we checked in they asked if one queen was what we had requested. We told them no and they upgraded us to a loft apartment! We had a small living room and up some stairs we had two single beds in a loft bedroom. The accommodations were great! The hotel is a ten minute walk from St. Mark's Square and in a very quiet neighborhood. If you want more action or views, this is not the place to stay, but if you want a short walk to the action, this is a great hotel!",
            "We had a package for 3 nights, included museum admission, dinner at La Caravella and a 'Junior Suite'. In actuality a full suite. Wonderful small hotel easy to get to but out of the madness of St. Mark's. Academdia and Guggenheim very close by as are Vaporetto stops and many nice restaurants and cafes. The included breakfast was great and a bonus was a free cocktail party one night. The staff was very helpful in meeting our needs, I couldn't recommend it higher.",
            "We spent a weekend at the Ca Pisani in their Jr Suite, which was absolutely wonderful. The hotel is within walking distance of all the main interesting places in Venice. The hotel itself is quite and very nicely decorated. The personnel was very friendly and willing to help out at any time. I would defenitly recommend this hotel to my friends.",
            "Just around the corner from the Accademia Bridge, this hotel is in great location for exploring Venice. Although we were there at the end of Carnivale, the rooms were very quiet. Front desk staff were charming and helpful. They made restaurant reservations for us on both nights and recommended good bars and interesting walks thorough the city. Can't comment on the hotel restaurant as we preferred to have breakfast in the local cafe and the bar was closed during our stay.",
            "We spent hours and hours trying to find a good hotel in Venice that was not a tourist rip-off, damp, old and grossly over-priced. Reading through the Trip Advisor reviews, this proved very difficult. The Ca'Pisani was clean, modern, good size room, great value and a 2 min walk to the canal. Would highly recommend. A standout vs the tired and worn overall poor quality hotels in Venice. Only downside was lack of a restaurant / room service but a good continental breakfast is served in their coffee shop / bar and there are plenty of restaurants within a short walking distance.",
            "The decorations are modern, we were received with courtesy our rooms were prepared on time. Rooms are very luxurious, big bathrooms with jacuzzi. Good bed and very clean, the only problem was a light over the TV that couldn't find were to turn it off and had to go to the front counter to know that if you push a small shelf below the TV it will turn off the light. Breakfast was excellent, strong cafe espresso, very friendly waiters preoccupied in giving the best service. This is my third visit to Venezia, and the first time in this hotel, will highly recommend it.",
            "We stayed at the hotel for three nights in June. We are planning on coming back next year. The hotel is great, and I was surprised to read the post about the maintenance. We found the hotel to be in great shape with a very comfortable bed. In fact, the beds are my pet peeve with foreign hotels generally having only a mattress, no box springs, so they are as hard as a rock or if old, saggy. This hotel had neither. The hotel is modern in furnishings, but as long as you know this ahead of time, it's no surprise. The staff was very friendly and helped me with my Italian. The restaurant had the typical European breakfast. There was plenty to eat. We ate at the restaurant one night. The food was great, and the staff went out of their way to make the meal enjoyable. Cheese tray for dessert was awesome, with glasses of port. What a way to end the evening. The bathrooms are not the typical little European size. Large and well appointed. Both a bath and shower. Two tvs in the suite. Windows really open. It is in a great location with neighborhood restaurants all around. We walked all around and never felt unsafe. ATM very close. Vaporetto stop within a two minute walk. If I had to be a real nitpicker, the only complaint was I forgot my adapter plug to use my dual voltage hair curler, and called down to ask if there were any in the hotel, or if there was some place close by to buy one. Front desk promised to find out and call back, but no one did. Husband said I didn't need one, I looked great with my straight hair, so he earned brownie points. Other than this one issue, the stay was perfect.",
            "My fiance and I decided to get married in Venice. This romantic city was the first stop on our 10-day honeymoon. After an extensive Internet search we booked a 2-night stay at Ca' Pisani for the nights of November 11 and November 12, 2007. The hotel was well worth the cost. It's located a stone's throw from the Accademia bridge, close to the vaporetta and not that far of a walk from St. Mark's, the Rialto and the post office. Located in Dorsoduro, it's away from the swarms of tourists and loud crowds. The hotel is modern and well-decorated. Our room was warm, spotlessly clean and comfortable. Although we didn't eat dinner at the restaurant on the first floor, the breakfast was wonderful, with various meats, cheeses, eggs, cereals, juice and milk. It was a vital part of our morning. Additionally, we had a nice drink there. The mini-bar was fully stocked. A computer with Internet access was available and there was a small roof-top terrace. We loved our Venice wedding and our stay at Ca' Pisani. We'd love to return someday.",
            "We have stayed again this year (last week), at the Ca'Pisani in Venice: this is a really outstanding place for various reasons. The extraordinary kindness of all the staff, from the front desk, to the chambermaids, they are are all smiling, very efficients, available, and with a good sense of humour! The rooms are large, very comfortable, with a beautiful \"deco-design\" furniture, and a great bathroom (jacuzzi...) with fine bathproducts. The breakfast is delicious, with various types of dihes, and everyday something new, but always the sympatic smile of the breakfast maid. The situation in Venice is outstanding: just behind the museum of \"Accademia\", very near from two vaporetto's stops: one one the grand canal, the other one on Zattere; and two minutes walking from the Accademia bridge, which allows two reach very easily any part of the city, and the must is that one can benefit of all these facilities living in a very quiet part of Venice, without the flow of the crowd. Ca' Pisani is an unforgettable place, where we certainly will return, and return again: \"the place\" in Venice.",
            "...not enough people know about it! Ca Pisani is situated in the art district and it is equidistant between Rialto and San Marco; in that respect it is superbly located since whether its restaurants or galleries or the market or the boutiques that you want- all is nearby. The hotel staff at Ca Pisani was knowledgable and efficient and always available to assist with any request or just generally to give recommendations when asked. The interior scheme is fairly daring and ambitious but appears to have been studiously thought out and the delivery is meticulous in detail. The result is a very practical but uniquely beautiful hotel. We stayed in a luxuriously comfortable room 31 (triplex) with a very Venetain view over the rooftops of the city. It was truly atmospheric and, having stayed at the Danielli and Grand Canal opposite Harrys Bar on my previous visits to Venice, I can wholeheartedly recommend Ca Pisani as the hotel to stay in when in Venice. PS. ladies- the ensuite whilpool tub is the real thing!",
            "The weather was cold - the month was January but this hotel and the staff were fabulous. The restaurant/bar was pleasant and entertaining and the staff was just great. IF you are looking for a great hotel in Venice - slightly off the beaten path but in a great location - this is for you! Art Deco touches - lovely decor - just wonderful. And it is fun to go even if traveling alone!",
            "My husband and I just returned from a trip to Italy this past week. What a wonderful country. Our first stop was Venice where we stayed at the Ca'Pisani hotel. The hotel is not in the main touristy areas (Dorsoduro area) however with a very short walk to the vaporetto and took less than 15 minutes to get to any of the main spots. After spending 2 days in Venice we were relieved at the end of the day to walk to our hotel that was on a quaint, quiet street. The hotel gave us a warm welcome and even gave us an upgrade to a different room that had an extra room with a couch and TV. The room was modern, bathroom smaller than normal (but nothing to complain about) and everything was very clean. We stayed in room #10 which was a short walk up the stairs (or elevator) and not on the street front. I was disappointed with the all inclusive breakfast however staying in two additional hotels afterwards, we learned this is the European way. The hotel offers free internet which was great, recovering from jet lag I would use computer early in the morning. Daniel, a front desk clerk was very helpful, offered me coffee and a crouisant one morning while I was working at computer. I am a very picky person and this hotel was excellent and couldn't be happier that it wasn't in the Rialto Market or San Marco areas. The hotel is on the same street where at the other end is the Zattere which is great for watching the sunset and having gelato. When you arrive in Venice take your own water taxi arranged at the airport, they will hopefully drop you off at the Accadamia Bridge (a vaporetto stop). When you get off, go around the to the left, walk up the street (1 block) and hotel is on your right. Very short walk and you will have all of your bags! Wondferful hotel, thank you for making our stay in Venice wonderful!",
            "Although this review is over nine months late, I felt compelled to write. We arrived in Venice in the middle of the night due to a missed flight from Frankfurt. After finding our way to the Hotel Ca' Pasani, we were warmly welcomed. Our room exceeded our expectations. It was very large, by European standards. The huge bathroom, with whirlpool, was an unexpected bonus. They even provided liquid laundry detergent which I used in the bathtub in my make-shift washing machine. Of course there was a laundry line in the shower stall. The entire hotel was tastefully decorated. The morning breakfast, sitting outside on the avenue, was charming. It was a great place to sit and people watch. Besides the great location of the hotel, the best part was the staff. All spoke English and went out of their way to be helpful. I especially want to mention Miriam M. at the reception desk. She was kind and her English was great. I believe her mother was from England. We would not hesitate to return to this hotel and to recommend it to friends and family.",
            "This is a fabulous bijoux hotel, with beautiful rooms. You feel you've stepped into a Hercule Poiret film set with all it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1930\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s splendour. The bathrooms are luxurious in marble. The restaurant is lovely, with great food. The hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful, with amazing restaurant recommendations. Just perfect for a romantic get away with one you love.",
            "My wife and I have stayed in Ca' Pisani for eight days last week... It was not our first visit: I know that hotel for ten years and have been there a lot of times, but every visit it is a real and deep pleasure: the hotel is a jewel of elegance, has an oustanding location in Venice (near a bridge, near everything but far from the noise), everyone in the hotel is incredibly nice, competent, efficient, the bedrooms are very comfortable and pleasan, well furnished, lighted and decorated.......and the breakfast is great! It is THE place in Venice where one has to stay....",
            "My husband and I booked the Ca' Pisani through Expedia and were suprised to get a rate of $207 a night for a standard hotel room in August. The hotel is in Dorsoduro, right next to the Accademia and the Guggenheim. It was a terrific location for August when the San Marco square is overwhelmed with tourists. The Dorsoduro is a bit more quiet than the center and has more charm, but it's easy to get to San Marco - you simply cross the Accademia bridge and walk for 10-15 mins. The Ca' Pisani was everything I had hope for. It's a small design hotel with lots of charm. The standard room is small, but the bathroom was a decent size, which is often not the case with European design hotels. The pillows and bed were comfortable and the sheets were simple white cotton. The hotel staff was very nice and accomodating, helping us with restaurant reservations, and the usual silly questions. The complimentary breakfast offered anything from bacon and eggs to pastries, but it was the multiple cups of coffee with perfectly foamed milk that made it a delight. Especially, since we could enjoy them at a table outside on the street people watching. I highly recommend this hotel and will try to always stay in the Dorsoduro when I visit Venice in the future.",
            "What a gem of a hotel! We stayed here 2 nights and this hotel was wonderful-silky linen sheets, modern, luxurious bathrooms and toiletries, a high-tech keyless entry system that let the staff know when you were in your room (and therefore you were never disturbed), free internet connection from the lobby, and delicious breakfasts served at tables outside...After tackling the crowds and sights of San Marco, Ca'Pisani was a welcome retreat. We had room 11 and it was so quiet! Even better for heavy packers, the water bus stop is very close. After seeing the ornate halls of the Doge Palace and the many churches of Venice, you will enjoy the clean lines and 1930s chrome and wood architecture of this lovely hotel. Stay here!",
            "Our first stop in Italy, in August '06, was Venice- Ca' Pisani. We had a superior room on the top floor and loved it! The bed was wonderfully comfortable and I'm very picky. The bath was fabulous with a skylight over the shower/tub. Two comfy chairs rounded out the room. It was all we could ask for. The breakfast was excellent. I'm amazed at anyone who says otherwise! We also had a dinner in the restaurant which we enjoyed. We found the front desk service occasionally brusque, but no more so than in other Italian hotels. Location was stellar. I greatly look forward to my next stay at Ca' Pisani.",
            "We liked everything about this hotel - its smart design, fabulous quiet location, easy to find, great helpful staff, and an amazing room. I was worried about space when sharing with my two nieces, but we had a room on two levels, where they had upstairs and I had downstairs, sharing an amazing large bathroom. I had never had great dining experiences in Venice, but both restaurants recommended by the hotel were excellent. Wonderful to be a short walk from everything but in the calm quiet of Dorsodouro, with the Guggenheim and Santa Maria della Salute so nearby. Excellent breakfast and Wifi everywhere.",
            "This hotel has it all, great service, superb buffet breakfast (croissants are excellent), fantastic design and it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be much better in terms of location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next to Galleria dell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Accademia and only a 10 minute walk to Piazza San Marco. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the hotel is very chic. A real effort has been made in this regard which is very refreshing. When I next visit Venice, I will most definitely stay at Ca Pisani again.",
            "Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pisani is a lovely small hotel designed in the contemporary/art deco style. It serves a hearty breakfast and has a charming outdoor caf\u00c3\u00a9. The hotel is manned by a helpful and friendly staff headed by Marianna, the proprietress, who has weekly cocktail parties so that she can meet her guests and they can meet each other. After our 6 day stay it felt like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home away from home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",
            "We chose Hotel Ca'Pisani as one of our honeymoon destinations based purely on Internet research, including feedback on TripAdvisor and the friendly assistance we received when we called the hotel to make some enquiries. Having not been to Venice before, it was a small, but well rewarded leap of faith\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 on the hotel and its location. Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Pisani is truly lovely hotel; contemporary in style yet warm and inviting. The facilities were excellent, the service (especially Marianna) was always courteous and helpful, the restaurant was a standout in a rather hit and miss market and the location was quiet yet still close to major attractions. Be sure to try the cheese platter! Highly recommended.",
            "I have just come back from venice staying at the ca'pisani for 3 nights. I travelled with my daughter who was recovering from a spell in hospital. We were very impressed with the hotel when we arrived, cleanliness and amenities were great. I think it would have been better to stay on any other floor than the mezzanine as unless we has not walked up the stairs to the terrace we would not have seen the lovely art deco funiture on the other floorsThe largest fault we found was that on more than one occassion when we came back at night we could not get a nightcap in the hotel, one night at 10.20 pm we asked for a coffee and were told NO. such a shame not to be able to sit in the little lounge and have a drink before we went to our room! We did not find the concierge particul;ary friendly or helpful just perfunctory (usually) NO answers.",
            "Stayed in the junior suite for 3 nights. The suite consisted of a king sized bed, separate lounge, bathroom and wardrobe cupboard, two TVs and a built in sound system. Room was very clean, quiet, far enough away from the canal not to get any noise from boats (which is a problem I had last time I stayed in Venice). Wasn't a fan of the bathroom - looked amazing, but the floor got very wet after showering, meaning if you wanted to go to the toilet you needed to put shoes on or get wet feet. Bathroom was well equipped - separate shower cubicle, jacuzzi. Although I didn't like the toiletries, they were manufactured by LUSH and smelt horrible!!!! Breakfast was reasonably good, not a vast selection but certainly enough, and all of very good quality. Probably better than you would expect from a hotel of this size. The location of the hotel is amazing. 10 minute walk to Saint Marks square, but in a slightly quieter area. La Rivista - the hotel's restaurant, is also amazing. Staff were friendly, hotel has got a good internet point (only 1 though) and a little roof terrass should you fancy a spot of sunbathing! Overall - a nice hotel. Would I stay here again .... not sure, probably unless I could find something better. The only reason I wouldn't stay is because of the bathroom, specifically the flooding!! !",
            "This was my third visit in three years to the Ca'Pisani. This hotel has everything going for it and is a wonderfully relaxing home away from home for visitors to Venice. While not cheap (we paid E369 for a deluxe room) prices include an excellent European/American breakfast complete with freshly brewed espresso, cappuccino and filtered coffee; meats and cheeses, cereals, eggs and bacon. The hotel is located on a street that is within a block of the Academmia Bridge where the Venice public water taxi makes frequent stops. The hotel' is a \"10\" on the interior design scale: its public spaces are filled with modern art that is beautifully juxtaposed against other textures such as natural brick, marble, glass, leather. The staff at the reception desk are uniformly friendly, well informed and eager to assist guests. We look forward to returning to this hotel many times in the future.",
            "Travelling to Venice often over the years, we have never really ventured out of a property off San Marco, but after reading the reviews, I just had to try it out. Ca Pisani is a gem of a hotel...right off the Academia, a skip and hop to everything, yet away from the madenning tourist haunts. I contacted the hotel late November as we were finalising our trip to Europe, and emailed Tommasso, and he immediately got back to us. As we were travelling with our nephew, we were looking for a triple - something quite unusual specially in the smallish rooms for Europe, and with a great rate, I bagged it. I was expecting a dorm type set up -- but I was pleasantly the surprised. The room was akin to a junior suite, with an anteroom for the sofa bed, a B/O television and high ceilings. Modern italian is best to describe the room....A sliding door separates the bedroom -- with a lounger and a armoire for the tv, fridge and the writing desk. The bathroom has a walk in dresser, and even had a jacuzzi tub and multi jet showers...amenities are by Lush. The breakfast room buffet, managed by Paolo, was simple spread, but the attentive service was just fanstastic, specially in a jaded town like Venice teeming with photog tourists. Arrangements for transfers -- they offer a meet and greet service at a small premium and restaurants are just perfect...one night, we came back late and wanted a bite, and they pointed us to Acqua Pazza -- one of my best meals in Venice to date. By and large, I have become a convert. Ca Pisani makes you feel at home....check them out.",
            "The Ca Pisani hotel is absolutely gorgeous. The room was very stylish and spacious. The bathroom was very sleek. The staff was very friendly and very helpful and even gave us an upgrade. The Ca Pisani hotel is in a great location. It is very close to must-see places like St Marco place, Dogen Palace, La Venice Opera, but just far enough away to not be overwhelmed by tourists staying in hotels. A great stay for a great price! For a romantic weekend or a business trip.",
            "I had the pleasure to stay at ca' pisani with my husband 3 weeks ago and we really enjoyed our stay. nice location: downtown but at the same time out of the crowds, wonderful staff both at reception and the restaurant, and original decoration. the hotel is member of 'design hotels' and they do have pieces of furniture and decor form the forties, along with modern technology like (free) wi-fi connection in all the rooms. we will suggest this little nice jewel hotel to all our friends! (and we will hopefully be back soon)",
            "We were here for 3 nights at the end of March for our 25th Anniversary. The hotel was in a good location to walk everywhere. The proximity to the Vaporetto stop was also good. We had one of the rooms that had the Bedroom on top. It was very clean and comfortable for the stay. We missed our connection and did not arrive until 11 pm. The only thing that was tough is that all of the resturants were closed. We adapted with Apples and peanuts and a bottle of wine. The Resturant had a great selection for breakfast and were very friendly. The reception staff were helpful and made us reservations each night. All in all a wonderful stay! I would highly recommend this hotel due to the location and the staff that work there.",
            "Having booked into 'disaster hotel' and found suite we'd expected not available we check on line for something else, found Ca Pisani and and went down to take a look. They handled us wandering in off the steet wanting to examine their rooms with great aplomb! A suite wasn't available on the first night so we had a largish room on the mezzanine floor, which was prefectly good and elegantly/modernly furnished, and checked into a suite the next day. The suite was a working/sitting area and an open sleeping area above. The see-through glass stairs to the bedroom were disconcerting at first, but we quickly got used to them. The only glitch was the room was very hot, so my wife went to reception who sent someone up, who told us the heating wasn't on as air wasn't blowing out of the grill. We said we knew it wasn't, the grill was simply hot. (The heating is centrally controlled, which makes sense in an old building with limited scope for air-conditioning). He then told to us contact either maintence or technical (can't remember) next time we had a query. The exchange left a bad taste. That said, we opened all three windows and cooled the upper room down that way; and the rest of the staff were fantastic, the hotel is very cleverly converted to combine an old building with modern touches, and the location is ideal. There's even Zaterre vaproetto stop at the end of the street, with a pick up point for taxis or the blue line to the airport. Love it, intend to go back to Venice and this hotel.",
            "With so many average hotels in Venice, this one is absolutely beautiful and cool. I know they have different rooms (some really nice and some of them small) but in general the atmosphere, the staff and the location are perfect! !The only average thing is breakfast.More of a 2 stars hotel...I totally recommend it! !",
            "I know this hotel receives top reviews but let's be honest...this is a hotel for people absolutely on a budget. It is certainly not a high-end boutique hotel. If you are on a tight budget looking to save money then this place is fine but for you high-end travelers this place will disappoint. The location is absolutely perfect but the hotel is absolutely average. I'm still not quite sure why its called a \"design hotel\". I hate to offend the hotel but the design is quite poor and dated as the furniture is old and feels very used. It's in desperate need of renovation. I'm sure the italian gods of design would agree :-) . The rooms are tiny even for Venetian standards. You can hear every move your neighbor makes in the room next door: when he walks, when he showers, when he snores, when he turns on the TV, when he.... The premises look dirty but are actually clean so that's not an issue. The breakfast buffet is \"ok\" but absolutely what you would expect from this type of hotel. I wanted to fall in love with this place before i arrived as all the reviews were absolutely great. From the second i saw the cluttered front desk i knew it wasn't what i was looking for. If you are looking for an impressive design hotel then this is not the place for you. If you are backpacking thru Europe or simply on a tight budget and aren't too fussy about hotels then the Ca' Pisani should suffice simply becuz of the wonderful location. By the way, I would like to say the staff were very polite and friendly which was a nice touch."

Our room was small, but it had a European type of feel, and it seemed many guests were European. We had both a small fridge and a microwave which was helpful. The free wireless is a nice feature with ability to print downstairs. I did not use the fitness center since we do so much walking, but would have had they had a pool. My bad for not checking that. The water bottle filling stations on each floor is also another great feature. We did not eat at the restaurant, but there are many nearby, including Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks for coffee and breakfast. Filming of Transformers 3 was taking place during our visit which made it very interesting.",
            "My husband, adult son and I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. The kitchenette (stove top, microwave, refrigerator) allowed us to fix breakfasts quickly \"at home\" before going out for early tours and to save money on some easy suppers. Basic pots, pans, plates, and cooking and eating utensils were provided. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. We didn't hear any noise from the street or from other guests with the white noise of the air conditioner....delightful sleeping. The two bathrooms were a luxury for the three of us. Note that the 2 bedrooms (one king, one queen) do not have doors, so they are semi-private, not totally private. Unfortunately, the sitting area was a little claustrophobic because we had expected a window and view. Instead there was just one window in the 2nd bedroom with no windows in the living area. At the front desk, I was told that all of the 2 bedroom suites have the same \"view\". We could see just other close buildings (no river) from the window in the bedroom. As other reviewers have remarked, the hotel's location is the BEST! We took the orange line from Midway and our son took the blue line from O'Hare to within several blocks of the hotel. We walked or took public transportation everywhere while touring.",
            "nice enough...check-in dude acted like he was doing me a big favor giving me a king-size bed, as they were out of queens. Woo-hoo! If I had made my own reservation, instead of our company picking this place for us, I would have got this as a matter of course... No tub, just shower; old tube tv. Was cold close to window. One light by bed didn't work, stopper in sink wouldn't stay stopped, and shower head had a leak in back, squirting water in reverse....what left bad impression (and was the last interaction I had with staff) was when I was checking out, I wanted to tell person behind desk about these things that needed fixing, and *she did not even interrupt her conversation with her colleague or even LOOK at me while she handed me my receipt*. I -did- interrupt her to tell her.....but no \"how was your stay/ how was the room/thank you and we'll see you next time\". It's a shame that the art of recognizing a customer (hint: LOOK AT him/her!) does not seem to be part of the training here. The fact that I feel strongly enough to post this review should be an indicator that customers value people skills! and deplore their absence in a person employed in a service industry!",
            "I travelled to Chicago to meet my parents who were visiting from overseas. A triple room had been booked in the Club Quarters hotel. I was the first to arrive and the room was a small room with a double bed and a sofa bed. I had been told at reception that we could upgrade to a larger suite for an additional $20 a night. We decided to upgrade and we were given a room in the River Hotel portion of the hotel. The room was phenomenal. It cost $140 a night and it was like a small, open-plan apartment. It had a fully equiped kitchenette and dining area and on either end of the suite, there were bedrooms, one with a king size bed and one with a queen. There were two bathrooms and there was also a sitting area with a television although this was not really necessary as both bedrooms had televisions also. We were so completely impressed with the hotel, I would whole-heartedly recommend it. It's very well located on the Magnificent mile right across from stop 2 on the trolley tour and the boarding area for the river cruises. The room was so comfortable and lovely and while I'm not sure if the cost of the upgrade to a suite was a special offer or not, it was definitely well worth the additional $20.",
            "This hotel is located on Wacker at Michigan. Lots of restaurants, shopping, sightseeing and Millenium Park close by. The hotel seemed more like a business club -- small lobby, small spartan rooms, built for short stays. But with the rates as low as they are, it's a busy hotel. The entire hotel staff was very nice and helpful. Housekeeping needs improvement. The bathroom floor had not been swept when I checked in and the bedspread had a small stain on it. On the second day, when I returned at 4:00, the room had still not been cleaned so it appeared that cleaning is completed quickly but not meticulously. If you can look past minor issues and alert the hotel staff when there are problems, then it will be worth it to book here. It's not perfect but you can't beat the price and location.",
            "While the first room they offered us was tiny (corner room), since that was all that was available, we waited and got a larger room (queen size bed, though they admitted it was shorter than the average queen bed). After the high prices at a nearby Hyatt, we appreciated the refrigerator for our use (vs. the Hyatt Regency where a Pepsi cost $4.25 and a sign warned us that using the fridge for our own items could result in a $25 fine), and microwave and plates and utensils if we wanted to eat in. Lounge had computers with free Internet use and printers (quite a change from the high prices of the Hyatt's business center). This is no swanky hotel, and the elevators were often overcrowded, resulting in waits, and I've slept in more comfortable beds, but for the price, it was fine. This is a hotel chain for members, though we had booked through Travelocity as non-members. When we tried to get information on staying in a Club Quarters in Washington, DC, the front desk said we had to call a central reservation number (not toll free); had to leave a message with someone who never returned our call.",

As stated the rooms aren't large, but I was by myself so I didn't mind, although even if I had my partner with me I still think it would be fine. The most important thing for me as a single traveller though was that it was clean, bright and very safe feeling. The bathroom was very clean and modern (I can't stand fusty old bathrooms), the bed was comfy, you get a desk with wireless access and TV, Microwave and Fridge. So very happy with the room. The service was also very good and efficient. They even let me leave my baggage with them a week later when I was back in Chicago even though I didn't stay with them that night. The Italian cafe attached is excellent! I had great pasta and salad there and the service was fantastic. All in all a great stay for the price. The corner cafe also does great breads.",

Sometimes I would have to wait 5 minutes or so for an elevator. That is really irritating if you forgot something and wanted to run back to the room! Plus we were on the 15th floor so we couldn't take the stairs! Other than that, the hotel was wonderful!",

Anyone visiting Chicago for the sights would appreciate the view of downtown, stretching to Sears Tower, the Field Museum, Lake Michigan and beyond. Great food is available from the small bistro on the ground floor, and all requests to front desk staff were very cheerfully accommodated. Maid service was of the highest standard.

The rooms are small, but how much time should you be spending in there anyways? They are clean, nice (albeit somewhat small) bathrooms and a great location for perfect access to State street and Michigan Ave. Don't waste your money going to a more expensive hotel, especially if you are going to be out doing things. One random note: the water bottle stations are really nice and convenient. You can take the bottles with you when you go out walking around or whatever too.",

The price was right and I had looked at the Club Quarters (which is the sister hotel located in the same building) and wanted to stay at Rivers. We ended up staying in Club Quarters anyway. I was really disappointed. I talked to management about it and was told that they were booked up and our only choice was to drive to another hotel a mile away. Sort of defeats the purpose of staying on the River. So we stayed at Club Quarters and the experience we had was very similar to the other reviewers. The room was small but clean and comfortable, until the patron next door started signing every morning with his radio around 7 am. The walls were so thin we could hear people in the hallway the elevators, and our neighbor doing all sorts of things. Location was great, price was right, but I wouldn't stay again. When I book a room at a hotel I expect to stay there, not somewhere else.",
            "This hotel is in a great location-right near Michigan Avenue and all that offers. I stayed in a club size room on a recent business trip and it was perfect for what I needed. The room was on the smaller side, but I didn't need a lot of space. The small window offered a great view of the Chicago River. The internet worked well enough-my only complaint was that the TV couldn't swivel to face the bed (though I don't think that's a problem with all room setups.) The staff was very friendly and helpful in answering my questions, and the parking was close enough. All in all, a great room if you don't need a ton of luxury or space.",
            "Booked the hotel online because of the availability of a '2 bedroom suite'. It turns out that the 2 bedroom suite had NO privacy or doors for the 'bedrooms.' When I called to complain, the hotel staff told me their add nver guaranteed a door for the bedrooms.

Make sure you get your reservation right, because once they get your money they won't let go!",
            "In terms of location, Club Quarters on Wacker can hardly be beat. It's right near Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile and most of the rooms have great views of the Chicago River and its landmark buildings -- the upper floors give a view of the Lake. The rooms are on the small size, but very clean and quiet. My room had only a shower stall and no tub (but I only take a shower anyhow). The price was very good indeed, and I checked in and out without a glitch. Bella Bacino's, the restaurant on the ground floor, offered excellent Chicago-style pizza and interesting beers on tap. Yum!! A couple negatives: the Wi-Fi was weak and intermittent. No sort of breakfast is offered, which I don't really see as a problem -- but I wanted to get a cup of coffee on my way out to my conference in the morning and they were out at the moment. Grrr -- must have coffee! But overall it was a good experience and I would recommend it. You're not paying anything near a luxury price, so don't expect luxury -- just a decent room in a great location.",
            "Stayed at Club Quarters Wacker at Michigan from Nov. 28-30 2007. EXCELLENT LOCATION, right off the Mag. Mile. Hotel staff was very friendly, and the housekeeper staff was equally as professional. This is mostly a business hotel, which is great, because no noisy children, and rowdy college kids, very quiet hotel. Although the rooms are small, is very cozy, and all amentias worked fine. There is a doorman out front which keeps out some of the street people from filtering in, as most of the big cities hotel have. Secure and safe location, \"El\" station right around the corner (State & Lake Stop). I would stay here again. I can really think of nothing negative to say. Bottom line... great 3 star hotel, safe area, good location.",
            "I booked this hotel through hotwire and was very happily surprised. We wanted a room close to the Magnificent Mile and we could not have found a better location. The entrance is tiny and the hotel does not appear to be great upon entering (turn right after the street entrance to find the clerks). The room itself is quite small, but very nice and clean. The bath room was also small but very functional. The average day time temp was 90F and the hotel AC kept up very well. The bed was very comfortable and had nice linens. We also had a room on the 22nd floor and we treated to an amazing view of the drawbridges on the river. They have recyclable water bottles and water filling stations throughout the building. Very handy for the hot weather we experienced!! The hotel is close to great restaurants (the Pizza at the onsite hotel was excellent as was the service!). We booked well ahead of time to get our deal ($150/night).",
            "Have stayed in many hotels in chicago and this is the smallest room I have ever stayed in. The housekeeping was a bit hit and miss some days coffee some days none!The plus points were free internet in the lounge and a water cooler which you could fill with the available bottles on each floor which saves a few bucks each day. The reception staff were a bit snooty for us holiday makers , witnessed very different treatment of business travellers.",
            "This is a really great find, in a superb location. The rooms although small are beautifully designed, comfortably and stylishly equipped with just about everything you could want, (except perhaps a fridge). The bathrooms, equally compact, do offer plenty of shelf space, make up mirrors, hairdryers and Gilchrist and Soames toiletries. A thoughtful touch in the rooms is a selection of reading matter (fiction, non fiction, personal development and reference in my room) and I very much appreciate the provision of water, high speed internet and incidentals like washing powder in the guest laundry. There are closets on each floor stocked with extra pillows, blankets, irons, ironing boards, milk, sugar etc so that guests can help themselves to what they need, whenever they want it. I stayed here on business (and it is particularly suited to the needs of the business traveller), but would happily return to this hotel for a holiday.",
            "The hotel is perfect for the weekend getaway for couples. While the rooms are small, we found it very clean and had a great view of the Chicago River (ask for this when booking). Hotel staff was great with dining, touring, and entertainment suggestions, as well as directions, transportation suggestions, etc. The location could not be better in relation to attractions, theatre, shopping, and tours. Perfect hotel for our needs. We can;t wait to go back to this great city and hotel. Great weekend rates.",
            "Didnit' care for the size of the room based on room rate of $124.00. Confusing lobby used for both River Hotel and Club Quarters. Did not like using room keycard to use the elevator. Not necessaary since my friend stayed a couple blocks away at the Hyatt Rengency and the elevator ran as expected without using room keycard. Also, she had a bigger room for under $190.00 for the same night.",
            "I booked this hotel in August '07 for a weekend baseball series between the Red Sox and White Sox. I was very satisfied with the amenities of the club sized room (bed and bathroom) but it was small. The only problem I had is that the walls were thin and unfortunately early Saturday morning I had to hear a couple having sexual intercourse for 30 minutes which interrupted my sleep. Other than that, this hotel is highly recommended.",
            "Great location and extremely friendly and helpful staff. I was made to feel very welcome from the moment I arrived and the duty manager (Tim??) couldn't do enough for me. I was given a room with a view without negotiation! The location could not be better - just off Michigan Ave and next door to a great breakfast bakery. Enjoy!",
            "This hotel is conveniently located along Wacker and is close to a few subway stops. Depending on the room you get (we got 1804), you can get gorgeous views of Lake Michigan. When we arrived at 12pm, staff were friendly and we got our room straight away. There are two elevators that cater the higher levels, so be prepared to wait a while if there is a lot of traffic. The room itself was standard; clean, not particularly spacious, shower only, working TV, toiletries, coffee and free internet. The queen bed was comfortable. For $100, it wasn't a bad deal.",
            "They charge your credit card at the time of booking NOT at time of arrival. DO NOT DO THIS! This is a scam-ish deal. They will not refund if something goes wrong...... ALSO they turned off heating system. NO HEATER!!!! Temps out were 50ish... NO fun cold room and very hard bed.",
            "I suppose my only real grip about the hotel (which was not the hotel's fault) is that we paid way too much for it. We stayed during Chicago Marathon weekend and we booked through Hotwire. We stayed in the tower which did have a nice view but was probably a bit smaller than rooms in the main building. There was room to swing a cat but it would have had been a pretty small cat. For example, our room had an iron and ironing board but I'm not entirely sure that there was room to set up the ironing board. On the other hand, there were several panels of windows with good views, including part of Millenium Park. The room was generally quiet but I think we faced the Hard Rock Hotel so on Saturday night we heard music until the wee hours. The location was good though, just across the bridge from the Magnificant Mile, close to subway and bus lines. It was great having free internet and printing access. We had little interaction with the staff but they seemed friendly and nice. I wouldn't really recommend the Italian restaurant in the lobby, hoever, unless you just wanted a quick bite. There are better places for alot less. If I had stayed there for business, I think I would have rated the hotel higher. It really is pretty ideal for the business road warrior with queen bed, lots of outlets, and desk. For a weekend get away kind of place, I wouldn't recommend it. It just lacked any ambiance, had a small room, and a smaller shower only bathroom. It was ok just not great.",
            "We stayed at Club Quarters Wacker Dr. Chicago on New Yeqar's Eve. There were four of us. We booked a room with two double beds. I haven't seen beds so small since the Dick VanDyke Show. These were Rob and Laura beds! There was barely room for one person on each bed, much less two. Of course they had no other rooms available. So we requested two roll aways. They kept insisting that we didn't have room for two. The room was extremeley small, but we knew we could make it work. After putting the night stand in the closet, pushing the two single beds together, and shoving the furniture against the wall, we had room. They argued with us nonstop, and finally told us that they would try two. Well, needless to say, upon returning at 3:00 AM, there was only one roll away. The front desk staff was very rude. Sure, they were crabby, but we were the ones who didn't have enough room to sleep. We ended up having to just deal with it. They were also very rude when we ordered a pizza. You have to go down and pick it up as they do not allow delivery people in the hotel. The desk staff was short with us when we didn't understand the procedure at first. Yes, we had had a few cocktails along the way, but we weren't beligerant or sloppy drunk. We were actually quite nice considering the way we were being treated. I understand that the last place they probably wanted to be was there working as all the partiers came in from their festivities, however, it is their job, and they chose it. Had the staff not been so rude, the lack of sleeping space would not have been quite as tough to take. We will never book with CLub Quarters again!",
            "I would highly recommend you this hotel. It's in really nice location to down town Chicago and rooms are really tidy and modern. I liked big bath room. Free wireless internet and laundry were really nice. They have nice cold drinking water in the hallway. Gim opens 5AM-10 PM. I will definetly come back here! !",
            "Room was clean and well maintained. Small but not cramped. The desk was well appointed with an LCD monitor on an arm, several outlets, interconnect cables, reading lamp and a shelf. Very comfortable working chair. Bathroom was for 1 but had plenty of space. Shower not a tub. Toilet was European style flush of 2 different water volumes. Good use of space for cabinet drawers and closet in the room. Free bottled water on every floor--fill it yourself near the elevator. Great feature. I found a closet in the hallway near the elevator where guests self-serve ironing board, iron, extra blankets, etc. Nice touch. To check into the room, just insert your credit card into the kiosk in the small lobby. Confirm a few details and out pops your room keys/cards. Must use the cards in the elevator to get to your floor. Restaurant next to the lobby is room service. Overall, it's a self-service hotel with little staff. But it's efficient, clean, well designed, in a great location and a great value at $139/night.",
            "This is not a luxury hotel. but offers a good value for money. Excellent location in the heart of Chicago, in the historical Mather Tower. The room was large enough, clean, with a view on east Wacker drive and Chicago river. Free Wi-Fi internet.The restaurant (Bella Bacino's) is great for a Chicago style stuffed pizza.",
            "We had a few family members in Chicago for the weekend, so we booked a room at the River Hotel because of the location. It's close to Wacker Drive and the room was contemporary albeit on the small side. Went out to meet a few people for dinner and we came back finding out that the AC was not working. We alerted the staff at the lobby and realized that the maintenance guy had left for the day. How can the hotel not have a maintenance person 24 hours a day? Needless to say, we were shocked to hear about it. We did not pay more than $150 and get a room that is as warm as an oven. When the staff learnt about our story, they unempathetically asked us to open the windows instead!!! Mind you, that does not make any sense considering the weather outside was about 90 F. They then offered to move us to another location away from the river but we refused because we chose the location for a reason and it is an unnecessary inconvenience to us at our expense. It was not our fault to begin with. After that they offered us a crappy fan which finally worked when we gave it a few knocks. It was a warm and miserable night for our family who came all the way to Chicago expecting something wonderful from this hotel. The next morning, we mentioned about it at the front desk again and all they could do was apologized. Not a single time did they compensate us in a form of a lower rate for putting us through this. After all, we did not sign up for a room which has AC problems. After much complains, the staff finally offer us a free upgrade if we come back the next time. That is not acceptable. What is the use of a free upgrade if the AC is not going to work?? Well, we won't be coming back anyways. He can keep his offer. You shouldn't come here either.",
            "I'm amazed at the bad reviews -- my wife and I had absolutely no complaints. It's a small hotel/condo combination in a beautifully-restored historic building, right on the river on East Wacker. So you can be perfectly situated downtown for half the price of the Swisshotel and the Hyatt Monster a couple of blocks westward. You can check yourself in on automated kiosks, although staffers will do it for you without your asking. We didn't encounter a single rude employee -- if anything, they were more friendly and accommodating than average. We had a \"junior suite\" (meaning a slightly bigger room with a queen bed & sofa) with a river view, which was quite comfortable. I can't think of a single thing to complain about, other than the lack of an in-room safe, one of my pet peeves. Internet was wireless and free. This is the downtown hotel of choice, as far as we are concerned.",
            "Best thing about the hotel is its location. You're a 90 second walk from Michigan Avenue. The parking is not bad for a downtown Chicago hotel. There is valet service or self-parking. The garage is just north of Michigan Avenue and takes fewer than three minute walk. The Chicago L station is less than a ten minute walk. Our room was small, but nicely appointed. Free wireless access was appreciated. Bed was average and bathroom was clean. Room was pretty dark when the curtains were closed. Staff was friendly. They brought up a luggage cart when we left and delivered toothbrushes when we realized we forgot to pack them. Some things to keep in mind that some may see as negatives, but didn't really bother me because we were there just to sleep. This isn't a full-service hotel. * there's not a convenient circular drive to drive up your car where a bellmen will greet you and take your bags * there is no conceriege service * the lobby is miniscule so checked bags are not readily available (given space constraints) There are only four elevators for this 20+ floor hotel. One was not working the morning we left, so there was a very, very long wait. Signs were present noting their environmental concerns. We hanged the towels as directed, but they were still swapped out, rather than allowing us to reuse them. I hate that. All in all, if you're looking for a moderately priced hotel in downtown Chicago that is close to Michigan Avenue with relatively easy access to parking and the L, this is the place for you. If you're looking for a snazzy business or conference hotel, this will likely disappoint you.",
            "Would stay here again without a second thought if it weren't for the anemic air conditioning that kept room just bearable. Not what you want in the summer. Restaurant in hotel is good for breakfast but best avoided for lunch and dinner for its lackluster menu with inconsistent quality. Pizza had flavorless frozen crust flavor and texture - and its an Italian restaurant in Chicago! Loved the location - loved the modern room aesthetics - again the AC is the bummer.",
            "My husband and I stayed here Wed. through Sun. last week. Previous reviewers complained about the thin walls and small rooms, but we found our room to be fine for two people. Our room was right off of the elevator and the only time we heard people was through the door. I know we had a neighbor, but we never heard anything through the walls. The free cold bottled water in the hallways is a great idea. You do have to go to the basement to get ice though. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. The Italian restaurant downstairs was tasty and reasonable. There is a Corner Bakery a few doors down which is great for breakfast. Booking with Hotels.com gave us a very reasonable rate for a hotel just half a block from Michigan Ave. and a few blocks from the Red and Brown lines. A very easy walk to the Art Institute and Millenium Park.",
            "We spent Father's Day in Chicago. My husband has been a life long Cubs fan so I gave him tickets for a game at Wrigley Field. I was not familiar with Chicago and after researching many locations/hotels I decided on the River Hotel. Best decision!! The hotel is nice with a great staff. When I made the reservation, I asked for a river view and they remembered that request at check in. The room was clean and not as small as people have described. The location is the best. We walked up and down the River Walk, to great restaurants and the train is just a block away. A cab fare to Wrigley field was $11. The staff in the Bella Bacino's restaurant were just great! If you stop in, say Hi to Crystal. We will always stay at the River Hotel when in Chicago. Don't understand the negative reviews - guess not everyone can be pleased.",
            "We stayed at the River Hotel in October 2011 -- were on the fifth floor on a Saturday night. Price enticed us to stay there -- I think it was $149 a night for the one room suite for 3. My husband, our 11-year-old son and I live in the Chicago suburbs and wanted to spend an overnight in the city. Pros: Location! Cannot get any better than Wacker and Michigan if you are going to do the Magnificent Mile, Millenium Park, Loop and Theatre District. Price! Other hotels in the area were charging twice as much. (Note, it does appear that River Hotel is charging more these days, though River Hotel does seem to still be on lower end of nicer hotels.) Refillable Bottled Water stations on each floor -- no biggie when it's zero outside, but big plus when it's 90 and humid. Attentive doorman -- can get you a cab right away when it is zero outside. Nice lobby with a small restaurant/bar. Small but clean rooms. Cons: Small rooms -- I would only recommend this hotel for business travelers or very short stays. There is little room for luggage. Noise at night -- see location. Our room was filled with city sounds at night. Perhaps the higher floors might not have this feature. Overall, a great place for an overnight. We will be back.",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Club Quarters hotels is that the size of the room is part of the experience. How else would a nice looking hotel in prime location offer such inexpensive prices? $130 for me on a Monday night...other hotels (including Hotel 71 next-door) were $299 and above. The hotel facade faces the river (I had a river-facing view, thanks to the great staff, and it was beautiful) and there are plenty of restaurants (the corner bakery cafe next door is fabulous...walked 1 block to the Hard Rock hotel and ate at China Grill). Bed wasn't too comfortable -- it was two twins put together with a foam connector to make a King... -- but I've stayed in my worse. Bathroom doesn't have a ton of counter space, but it was very clean. Wi-fi was free (I was at the tail end of the signal so my speed was very slow). I would stay here again if other, nicer hotels have cheaper rates...but for $130 it well exceeded by expectations.",
            "I stayed in this hotel for a week during a business trip to Chicago and I simply cannot understand the bad reviews. Yes, the size of the room was small, but I only went there to sleep. Everything was always immaculately clean and there is everything you need (including free wireless Internet). Besides, the location of the hotel is second to none, the restaurant downstairs is OK and the service seemed excellent to me. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a five-star rating are the two elevators, which clearly are insufficient for such a number of rooms.",
            "I was here in mid February and I gotta say, it truly is an amazing hotel. Clean, comfortable for the price. I got a great deal at around $89 a night. Right off of Michigan Avenue, convenient location. The staff was amazing. Rooms were so clean and had so much attention to detail. I have read some of the reviews regarding room size and I stayed in one of the smaller rooms available. It was good enough for just me. I was not in the room anyway, only to sleep so I did not care about a large room. I thought the room size was good enough. They offer larger rooms so if you did have a problem witht the room size, you can always upgrade. I recommend this hotel to anyone, for business or pleasure!",
            "This hotel is one of the best kept secrets in Chicago! Yes, the rooms are small and really designed for only one person; however, how much time does anyone really spend in their room? The staff were wonderful, the bed was extremely comfortable, the amenities were the same as what you would expect in a larger and more well-known place. The best part was the location - right in the middle of everything. We were able to walk everywhere with no trouble. If there was any downside, I would have to say it would be the restaurant downstairs - it wasn't one of the best in town, but adequate for breakfast. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Chicago!",
            "I stayed at this hotel for two nights while visiting Chicago on business in September 2007. The location is excellent being between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile. However, the elevators simply do not work properly, and it is not the place to stay should you need to get to and from your room quickly or frequently. I saw several customers have trouble getting to their rooms, and the front desk staff were nonchalant, and would not even allow customers to take the stairs. (This is obviously a persistent problem.) Nevertheless, it is probably good value for your money, and in a good location.",
            "I just returned from a weekend in Chicago to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday - and we stayed at the River Hotel. I cannot believe the bad reviews that some have given this hotel - unless they are just the sort of folks that you cannot make happy no matter what you do. We got to the hotel to check in, and were very quickly assisted by Tim - who was fabulous! When he discovered that we were in town for my daughter's birthday - he fixed us up with a couple of passes into a local club and was super-friendly. :) Our room was on the 10th floor and faced North - so we had THE most beautiful view!! It looked right out over the river and we could also see west down the river across all the bridges. The room was a superior/studio - it was not huge - but the perfect size for the two of us. There was also a sleeper sofa in the room, so it will actually sleep 4 people. The room was immaculately clean - and the bed was super-comfortable. We also ate one night downstairs at Bella Bacino's - and the staff there is also friendly. I had taken two bottles of wine with me and realized that I did not remember the corkscrew and the bartender at the restaurant opened them for me. This hotel is actually one of the more moderately priced hotels in downtown - and I will definitely stay here again when the opportunity presents itself! Great value and a great hotel!!!!! Thanks River Hotel for a memorable weekend!",
            "Sleek hotel in the best location there is in Chicago--right on the Chicago River and Michigan. I had a 10th floor room with a view right down the river with its numerous bridges. The room was really a nice sized room, though it was called a suite. My room was super quiet-I never heard another guest during my 48 hour stay. In fact, though the hotel was full, I never saw another guest on my floor. There was free Wi-Fi access.",
            "Location and cleanliness of the room ar perfect. But first, the staff is really not interested in giving you some tourist information nor do they have documentations to help you on the attractions. Second, I lost a silver ring in my room and when I called 5 hours later, they could not find it... So I seriously doubt about their honesty... Finally, on one night, there was a party of people on my floor and even if I called the front desk twice, they could not warn them to make less noise (even at 5 in the morning). So I could not have a good night sleep. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone..",
            "My husband son and I booked this hotel through the recommendation of my brother who was getting married at the aon center. I booked a room that said it had 2 double beds .When we arrived we found the 2 doubl beds to be two beds pushed together in a room that seemed to be a little bit bigger than a closet. The room we were assigne d never did cool off and with the weather outside being so hot and humid outside it became a huge issue. They eventually gave us another room witch was muchj cooler a slightly larger than the one we had before.The elevator issue really bugged me. It took forever to swipe your card to get the elevator moving. I did like the location because we could just park in a parking garage and then walk or take public transportation if we wanted. Also the desk clerk we dealt with was very helpful. I could not really stand the small rooms so I do not think I would stay there again.",
            "I stayed at the hotel for a week in late August. I knew that rooms were considered small be some reviewers, but I did not find them to be cramped. The check-in/check-out procedure was good. The public areas were fine. I normally had no problem getting to use a computer in the public area. My room was clean and generally well kept by staff. The location is great if you walk, use public transit or the trolley system (paid one) for tourists. The hotel has a small bar and the restaurant is fine. My only concern would be as construction on Trump Tower across the river progresses that noise levels may get high. It was not a problem at my visit. I had a fine few of the Chicago River. My visit was good and I would stay again. it is not an awesome experience, but it did not create stress or disappoint.",
            "My husband booked this hotel for a weekend trip. Thankfully I will only be here 2 nights. It's clean & would be great for a business trip or something like that. It's very tiny & I was on the 17th floor with no view. There is a walk in shower with a very sad shower curtain. The bed is okay, but mine @ home is nicer. It's not terrible, but it just isn't somewhere I would ever stay...ever...& definitely not for an anniversary trip. When we go away it's usually to a place with deluxe accomodations to relax & rejuvenate from our hectic lives & this is not up to my standards. I'm very disappointed. There is a good little italian restaurant connected to it.",
            "This is located by wacker and michigan its a very good location, theres restaurants within close walking distance. Walls are too thin between rooms, I can actually hear the guy next door snore. Room fixtures are basic. Small rooms but adequate. Free bottled water unlimited - great! They should have these plastic bottles recycled though. Free wireless connection Booked through booking.com and paid 95 dollars total for a night. if there are other hotels in the area with lower or comparable price, I might choose the other. If not then I can live with this hotel.",
            "My wife and I were excited to get a weekend away without our kids. The plate was set: Grandma/Grandpa had the kids, our flight was actually on time, easy transit to the hotel from Midway and then we open the door to our room...... It was a stinkin closet!!! There wasn't even room on either side of the bed to walk on. It looked nothing like the pictures that were on the internet. I immediately called and complained. They hesitantly moved us to another room the next day, but I heard from several others that they got the same deal and were not able to be moved. Additionally, due to the \"Linen Man\" moving towels up and down the 2nd elevator, we had to wait 45 min. 2X to get down to the lobby. We were livid and almost missed our flight. Not much for ammenaties at the hotel. Very small italian resteraunt at the bottom floor with a bad menu. Luckily the location was good and easy walking distance to other restaurants. We paid an avg of $200 per night including tax. This was one of the cheapest hotels we could find and now I see why.....",
            "This was a girls trip to a 40th birthday. My girlfriend and I shared the 1 bedroom suite, which was smaller than we thought, but the view was amazing! Called the night before arriving and spoke with the manager (Tim) who was so sweet to take our request (a river view) into consideration. We got it (keep in mind, we checked in on a Thursday night). The staff was so pleasant, the rooms very clean, everything was perfect! I am all about location, and this is the PERFECT area! Lovely restaurant downstairs, a Walgreens right around the corner for spirits, fun little pubs/bars across the street, the River tour right across the street, Magnificent Mile right there, Hancock building a $7 cab ride (go to the top and have lunch/dinner and enjoy the best view of the city), this is one of the cleanest cities I have ever seen (yes, it's the location). Plus, free internet connection! I just love this place, I can afford more, but why pay more? The beds are so comfy also. This was a pleasant surprise. I can't wait to go back! If you are all about sight seeing and not being in the room much, this is the hotel for you! Also, if you can catch the Segway tour, do it! !",
            "Rooms are small. Staff less than friendly. In fact, at check-in the hotel clerk advised me my deposit would be returned to me immediately, but they were not. Its now been 5 days. Why do they get to make interest off my funds, and more important why do I have to pay interest for incidental charges I didn't even incur. Furthemore, we could not even sit in the lounge aea in the restaurant in the bar because it was rented out. Not to mention they were doing filming right in front of the hotel so pretty much every time we went in or out we had to wait anyhere from 10 to 30 minutes. There was no advance warning of this nor even an apology for the inconvenience from the hotel. And don't even get me started about film clean up crew scraping metal to road and the beep beep beep of trucks backing up whle the flm clean up crew worked from approx. 11 pm to 1:30 am. Hmm, do they care about their guests? But the bed was firm and comfortable.",
            "this was a surprisingly comfortable 2 bd 2 bath suite w/a compact kitchen that included 2 burner stove, mini fridge, microwave and service for 4 in the cabinets. Had 3 flat screens, one in each bedroom and one in the common sitting area. king bed in one rm, queen bed in the other. No view. The space was great for the 3 of us and would be good for families. There are no bedroom doors, just partitions, so be aware if complete privacy is needed. Best thing was the terrific location just steps off Mag Mile and close to Millennium Park. tons of restaurants nearby. Walking distance to all of Chicago's downtown attractions or short bus/taxi rides for those who prefer to ride.The rate was quite reasonable-we booked a couple of months in advance. Would absolutely stay again.",
            "My husband and I went to Chicago for our 30th wedding anniversary. He had stayed at the River Hotel for a conference and loved it so we decided to go together. There is nothing negative I can say. This hotel's location is perfect, right on the Chicago River, in easy walking distance to Lake Michigan, Magnificent Mile, Millenium Park, the Art Institute, the Symphony, fabulous restaurants, everything! The CTA from O'Hare lands you just a couple blocks from the hotel's door. Our room overlooked the Chicago River! Very European design in the rooms, small but modern, beautifully appointed. The service was perfect and the price, for some reason, is much better than many of the chain hotels in the area. They even have chilled water dispensers with empty water bottles on every floor. We used this feature constantly. I can't say enough about this perfect little boutique hotel. Even the architecture of the building is stunning!",
            "Our recent stay at The River Hotel started off wonderfully due mostly to the very central location of the hotel between Michigan Ave and Wabash along the river. However we quickly realized that our air conditioning wasn't working. I called the desk three times to report this. They did send up an engineer who confirmed that our unit wasn't working and then disappeared without fixing anything and we never saw him again. It made for a very uncomfortable stay, as our room was 80 degrees with no fresh air the entire time. Upon checkout the lady took off one night's charge for valet in order to try to mitigate my disappointment. I would have rather paid the second night of valet and been more comfortable for the weekend. The service was all very friendly but not terribly helpful. We checked in with many bags and were not offered help from the valets or the front desk with carrying the bags or offering a trolly to push them to our room. The price and location were outstanding, but next time I will pay more and stay somewhere more accomodating.",
            "Having never been to Chicago before I wanted something central, so based on reviews on here I took a chance on the River Hotel. I was not disapointed. From the minute we arrived the staff were very friendly and helpful, and the room was clean, modern and very comfortable. The location of this place is it's greatest selling point, right on the river and central to all the tourist places. I loved the city and I loved this hotel, will be going back to both for sure.",
            "The great location is my favorite aspect of this hotel. Just steps off Michigan Ave., and very near the red line subway. Staff was friendly, rooms are small, but the sheets and pillows are heavenly. Bathroom is also nice. They even had books in the room for you to look at. Would definitely stay again.",
            "We got a great deal staying here and for the price, it may have been one of the best deals EVER! $150 a night for 5 day's while I was in a class at the Sears tower. Elephant & Castle in the hotel for Breakfast was convenient as well. I moved rooms once because of construction noise with no hassle at all. Given the fact it was down town, I was okay with a little extra noise.",
            "The \"Executive\" room was tiny - barely room to walk around the bed to get to the window. The wireless internet access didn't work. The TV remote didn't work (it was broken on the TV end). And those are the only two amenities. The elevators are finicky and you have to press the buttons just right to get them to work. To get to the gym or vending machines, you take two separate elevators into a creepy, gross, dirty basement. (One is the freight elevator.) When I asked for a rate reduction because of the problems, first I was scolded by the front desk clerk who said I should have reported the TV problem the night before. (I had - they couldn't fix it.) She also said the wireless had been down for 2 days (not mentioned when i checked in, however.) Then she said they wouldn't adjust the rate (over $200!) because I had booked online, via Hotels.com. Hotels.com will only offer \"hotel bucks\" towards a future booking, but i can't imagine using them ever again, knowing that hotels don't provide the same level of customer service as they do if you book direct.",
            "We really enjoyed our stay here! We chose it because it was the cheapest we could find in downtown Chicago and totally lucked out. The location was perfection: close to everything we wanted to see, as well as transportation. We even had two views of the Chicago River from our room! The room wasn't huge, but it was well laid out and we had enough space for our needs. Attractive furnishings and no ugly floral bedspreads! Yeay! Super clean. I'm usually skeeved out by several aspects of most hotel rooms but can whole-heartedly recommend this place. Oh, and they had cookies in lobby during the afternoon. How can you not love that?",
            "Working in Chicago the Club Quarters on Wacker was notably cheap on my company travel agents list and it was local to where I would be working so I tried it. The building is quite impressive upon arrival - a grand old brownstone building with polished brass appointments. Check in staff were very friendly and efficient. The room was very disappointingly small: it was too small really to work in comfortably. However there's free wireless and a small desk to work at. I had to keep the curtains drawn all the time because the window was not double glazed and felt like it was open, such was the loss of heat through it to the Chicago winter outside. Not great. Bed was comfortable. Coffee machine but no minibar, which wasn't very convenient. There is an Italian themed restaurant : Bacino's : just outside the foyer that serves as a hotel restaurant. Food was OK , atmosphere and service quite, quite excellent in the evening. An oddity was that I wanted to hire a conference room during my stay and I had to contact the catering manager at Bela Bacino's.. ... I was unsuccessful, and had to meet my customer in another hotel instead. Finally I had to check out early and found an early checkout charge. Fair enough I guess, but that's the first time I have ever encountered this is a business hotel. It was an OK stay, but with so many better , more spacious hotels available in Chicago I see no reason to stay there again.",
            "Room was well worth the money. Valet was very accommodating and pleasant. Perfect location right off corner of Wacker & Michigan Ave along river. GoChicago cards and info right across street. River taxis go between Michigan Ave and Navy Pier. House of Blues right across river. Room was small but very clean. Nothing fancy, but still nice.",
            "This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a \"late checkout\"? Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it? Well, this hotel charges $35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel.",
            "I had a Mommy-runaway-for-the-weekend trip Mar 30-Apr 2, 2006 and stayed in a \"Director's Room.\" Queen-sized bed, two bedside tables, arm chair, desk and chair, little closet, little bathroom with slightly oversized shower. I was alone and out of the room most often so the size was fine. A professional membership got me the room for $76/night which, for right-in-the-middle-of-everything-Chicago isn't bad at all. I walked to the Art Institute, the Symphony, the Ann Taylor Loft store, and the House of Blues without a problem. Parking on the next block was $20+ a day without in/out. As a woman alone, I wasn't wild about the subterranean parking garage, but it was well lit and there was an ancient man acting as a guard. The little restaurant downstairs was terrific and I ate there both nights. Try the asparagus and prosciutto salad with a glass of Valpolicella and the white pizza. There's a coffee shop just outside the hotel that was delicious. Overall, it's not a luxury hotel, the rooms aren't huge, but the room had the necessities and a nice view.",
            "I arrived on Monday 23 April in the Evening, after a long haul flight from Dublin to Chicago O'Hare. Stayed Six nights. Got the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) Blue Line into Clark and Lake Station. After a long flight, it was a relief to find such a quiet, clean and cosy hotel. some other reviews said rooms here were small, but i thought my room fine for two, even though i had the double bed room to myself. Hotel is well located for seeing the sights of Chicago and shopping is within walking distance on State Street (Best for bargains) and Michigan Avenue (High End Shopping). Check out the Italien American Restaurent on the Ground Floor. Excellent Breakfasts, and evening meals are very good too. Other good eateries Seafood, Steak, etc.are in the immediate neighbourhood. Other Plus Points- Complimentary Internet Access for Residents. Ask the Concierges anything. They are very helpful, in particular, Kevin and Tim. They certainly know their city!",
            "We three gals booked the two bedroom suite well in advance so we got an unbelievable rate. I'd be hard pressed to think of a better location-access to North Mich, Millenium Park/Art Institute, the Loop, the Riverwalk...the room was beautifully appointed, great bathrooms, comfortable bedding, kitchenette, quiet...no view from the 2 BRs but that wasn't of particular concern to us. It does share an entrance with Club Quarters but I'm not sure they're actually affiliated with each other so the comments about Club Quarters may not apply. Though we were doing the girlfriend thing this suite would also be great for two couples who don't require tons of privacy- there's no door - and terrific for a family group that would be accomodated by one king and one queen bed. The sitting area was great for hanging out and though we only used the kitchen to store beverages and snacks I could see bringing take out up there, heating up leftovers, etc. There's a Corner Bakery right next door, also a huge plus for the early morning coffee run-though there were also in-room coffee makers. Another nice touch was filtered water & water bottles you could fill up in the hallway. I would stay there again in a heartbeat! Just reserve far in advance for a really good rate.",
            "Booked hotel on Orbitz. Asked for adjoining rooms. Advised to call hotel direct for that. Spoke to Virginia at hotel on 3 separate occasions. She said adjoining rooms weren't available but we could get rooms that were next to each other. Got to hotel early & was told check in was at 3. Went back to hotel at 3:45, only to be told rooms weren't ready. Hotel staff wouldn't promise a room, although we had already paid Orbitz. Hotel staff said we should have booked directly w/the hotel. After lots of frustration and anger we were finally placed in a suite with two BR & two baths. We were traveling with our son, daughter-in-law, two small grandchildren & our daughter. (Had booked a smoking room for her) Once in the suite, we determined it wasn't large enough for all of us. At that point my husband & I were placed in a standard room (had booked a suite), which wasn't next to our family as requested. Our original hotel was Club Quarters. Virginia had moved us to the River Hotel because she said 'It was newer'. Smoking is only allowed at Club Quarters, so we weren't even in the same hotel as our daughter. She couldn't come to our room/hotel & we couldn't go to hers because the elevators are operated by room keys. The next day we tried the hotel's small restaurant for breakfast. Our granddaughter ordered chocolate milk and french toast. We were informed they had no chocolate for the milk and were out of french toast. All in all, it was VERY frustrating for our whole family. Also, when we asked to speak to management on the first day, we were informed that no one was available until Mon. What a mess this turned out to be! We will DEFINITELY never stay at this place again! !",
            "My friend and I arrived early and we were able to check in right away. The room was small but very managable.. The beds were comfortable. There was free purified water on our floor with water bottles so we were able to fill and go.. I would stay there again, for leisure.. The location was awesome, was able to walk every where.. We were near trump tower, the Michigan Ave bridge and not far from Grant Park.. I enjoyed the hote and the staff. Laundry service for those that need to wash something and btw they were not coin operated..the hotel even had detergent in the room that you could use.. The elevators were alittle slow, but all in all a great hotel..",
            "I took my 6 year old daughter to Chicago for an end of summer vacation. This hotel was perfect for us! We got a room with 2 twin beds for $139 (plus tax, which for Chicago is really high). The location was a block away from the free trolley stop (which takes you to the museums, Marshall Fields, Navy Pier, etc.) , and right across the river from several boat tour options. There is also a Corner Bakery right next door which was great for breakfast and lunch. There's so much to do within just a few blocks. We were on the 21st floor and had an outstanding view of the river. I feel like we just could not have done better than this hotel. Yes, the room is small, but it had everything we needed.",
            "This is a decent hotel for business travelers. A very nice feature is the nice business center and free use of the printer. However, the printer was broken for much of my stay and the wi-fi is weak if you stay in the towers. Also, the staff are very hit-or-miss. I firmly believe that you shouldn't judge the quality of a hotel based on interaction with one or two staff, but many of the staff were unwelcoming and treated guests as if they were a hassle. The rooms are small, but adequate. The price is reasonable. The location is really very nice...just off the magnificent mile. You can walk to everything.",
            "location - can't do better than this - just off Michigan Ave and straddling the Loop and Magnificent Mile plus there is a fabulous Italian Restaurant on site Price - very competitive Rooms - fine - some great views history - one of Chicago's really interesting and historic buildings - stay in the tower overlooking the river for business - great board rooms and plenty of computer stations (never a line up) and free printing staff - very good beds - not the same comfort that you'd get at the Hilton",
            "River Hotel was really an amazing experience as a boutique hotel. I was in town for biz and booked through Amex package to secure a really great rate. I was upgraded to a suite with river views upon check-in, which made my life much better. Apparently other rooms are signifcantly smaller, or have poor views, also no in house mini fridge. I was there for a week so these amenities were crucial for me. The internet was great, bed small and firm, but nice. I liked upgraded bathroom as well. The rooms are certainly tiny, but you are in downtown Chicago at a great rate and with incredible views. This isn't your typical boxy corporate hotel - enjoy it! Valet parking was an added cost that I was not expecting, but it wasn't so bad - and I really enjoyed having my car pulled around for me and put away for me. As I was rushing to work each morning it made life SO much easier than trying to find parking or pay way too much for a garage 10 blocks away.",
            "Across the street/river from Trump Tower, close to Millenium Park, Magnificent Mile, Willis Tower, John Hancock Observatory and downtown shopping. We also walked to Shedd Aquarium and Navy Pier. The United Centre (hockey/basketball) was 6 miles so it was a short cab ride. We had a suite since there was three of us and we needed the sofa bed.Great kitchenette with microwave and fridge. Clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful. We'll definitely stay here next time we travel to Chicago.",
            "We've been to Chicago several times and I think this hotel stay was my favorite. Other travelers complain about the small rooms, but I would gladly give up space for the beautiful river view we had. We enjoyed having a microwave and refrigerator in our room and the free wireless internet was a great plus. True- the elevators were a bit slow in the morning because of the cleaning staff using the same 2 elevators as the guests, but I planned for it and was never late for anything. My spouse, 2 friends and myself spent a week there in July would all highly recommend this hotel.",
            "The hotel was in walking distance of most major attractions- parks, museums and shopping. Our room was on the 21st floor and we had a great view of the river. The rooms were small, but comfortable. The food at the restaurant was very good. We took the train from the airport (only $2.25 each) and the hotel was about 5-6 blocks away from where we got off. For the price we paid and the amount of time we spent in our room this was a great deal.",
            "My boyfriend and I are in college and went to Chicago for spring break. This hotel was perfect. Right on Wacker and Michigan avenue...in the heart of the city. We walked everywhere! The staff was very helpful, we arrived at 10 am and got to check in early and the concierge helped us figure out where to eat lunch and where to begin our day. It's incredibly clean and safe. You have to have your key in order to use the elevator. The rooms aren't small, they are just long and narrow. I could foresee it being a problem for someone who wants to relax at the hotel, but it is still very nice...and who goes to Chicago to lay around in the hotel room anyway? I'm an architecture major and would like to note that this hotel is in the historic lincoln tower, a 40 story structure which used to be the cities largest skyscraper...( many many years ago obviously!) Also, the beds have down comforters, the bathroom is quite large, looks newly remodeled and has a great shower. The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that the wireless internet went in and out a few days that we were there. We called the front desk and they said it had been happening lately and they didn't know why...so perhaps it has been fixed now. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel for just about anyone who wants to be right in the center of downtown Chicago.",
            "The hotels locaton is wonderful, but the rooms are tiny. I have never seen hotel rooms this small in the United States. The hotel is in a beautiful historic beaux arts office building, but the room have the charm of a dorm. The bathroom only had a shower and the closet was the size of a phone booth. The television is too small to see from the bed. The bedding was cheap. Room was very clean and in excellent condition. Elevators were very slow and required room card to operate. The sheer size of the room made it difficult for two people to share. Staff was very accommodating.",
            "a great little hotel right in the heart of chicago and within walking distance of all the attractions chicago has to offer.Compared to other hotels in and around the area, I thought I got and absolute bargain through Expedia. Checked in within minutes and checked out in even less time by charming and helpful staff. Free computers to use,plus special computer to print out flight home boarding passes. Start your long day with a breakfast in restaurant just 50 metres away,or hotel restaurant. I would not hesitate to stay there again. One tip if you go up the Sears or Hancocks towers make sure its a cloudless day,if the clouds are low you wont see a thing!",
            "This hotel is in a perfect location to downtown Chicago - couldn't ask for better! The public transportation/train system is excellent and the hotel is a short 5-10 minute walk to many of the lines. I took the train from O'Hare and it was super easy ! My room was a basic Club Quarters room - standard amenities. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would most definately stay there again on my next trip to Chicago -",
            "Stayed here for two nights to visit Chicago. It was confusing to find details on the Internet because Club Quarters and River Hotel are both in the same building - not quite sure what the difference is but there were two reception desks. Many attractions, restaurants and bars are within walking distance and the public transport links are good. The room was nice with a huge bed and decent bathroom but there was no place to put your case other than on the ground. No hotel safe either. The check-in staff were mixed, one very friendly and helpful and the other disinterested. Overall I would recommend this hotel for the location and the price.",
            "We stayed at Club Quarters in December. We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked. Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district. If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your room? The rooms were clean and thats really most important. When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in. We were told we could valet park for $36.00 or for $20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street. We opted for the $20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!! My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it. Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back. The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time. After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel. We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great. Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave.",
            "If I thought I could find another hotel room this close to The Mart during NeoCon I'd check out. The room looked very nice at first glance. Then I noticed the bathroom floor not only hadn't been washed, it hadn't even been swept! A call to housekeeping produced no results. I've always been wary of using hotel provided glasses....have you ever actually seen a rack of clean glasses on the maid's cart to replace the used ones in the room??? Well ours still had the lipstick smears from prior guests. YUCK! I can't call a dirty room at any price a good value. \"Sleepless from Seattle\"",
            "I usually stay here when I am in Chicago for business. The rooms are small but comfortable and clean. The bathroom is a extremely small but updated. This hotel is in a great location, walking distance to the magnificent mile. Great value for the location.",
            "Fantastic location but for $200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere.",
            "We just returned from two nights in Chicago with a stay at this hotel. We've been to Chicago numerous times, but these accomodations were, by far, the best yet. We had booked on Priceline.com and when I called the hotel to inquire about additional sleeping accomodations because there were four of us...they upgraded us (for just an additional $30 each night) to a suite. The suite was room 410 and room 411 combined. We had two beds, a flip out chair/couch, two refrigerators, two bathrooms, two desks a microwave and PLENTY of room. Although this hotel caters to business travelers, the location and awesome arrangement made for a great family weekend. The room was newly remodeled, and everything was top-notch. The decor was very modern and tasteful. This location, on the corner of Michigan and Wacker really cannot be beat. You are within blocks of the Mag. Mile, a 2 minute walk to the subway, about 10 min. from Navy Pier, a couple of minutes from State Street shopping!!! We arrived early on July 3rd, and were allowed to check-in before noon. On the day we left, they held our luggage so we could walk around and enjoy some shopping before we had to catch the train. Now I feel spoiled, and really won't want to stay any other place when we visit Chicago.",
            "My girlfriend and I stayed here New Year's day evening to experience some of downtown Chicago's treats. It was perfectly situated between the shopping north of the river and the cultural offerings due south off Michigan. Rooms are as you expect in a city -- small -- but the bed was clean and comfortable and we had a view of the river. The hotel was quiet this evening after the holiday weekend and the concierge was very helpful in getting us a taxi at 4:30 am to catch an early flight back west.",
            "I stayed here for three days while working on a book about Chicago. The location is perfect, on the north end of the Loop and foot of the Mag Mile, buses at the door and the el just a few blocks away. I had a Tower room (just 2 on the floor and the other was empty) so it was very quiet. Staff was friendly and efficient. Housekeeping forgot to service my room one day but a call to the desk brought a housekeeper within minutes. Free WiFi throughout the hotel and a good business center. Strongly recommended for business travelers, good for couples or singles, OK for families with older kids.",
            "This was to say the least the most dissapointing hotel room I have EVER seen. It was so small , no room at all in the tiny bathroom and stand up shower only.The end of the bed was less than 12 incehes from the wall so to get to the tv you had to scoot sideways to go to that side of the room. I never write reviews but this was ridiculous !! This was the superior room .......whatever that means .LOL",
            "Perfect hotel for a single female traveller. The hotel was clean, convenient, and steps away from major attractions. Easy to access by public transportation. The room is smaller than average, but not too small, and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway. Computers with internet access a plus. Friendly staff. The only gripe I had was the elevators...there are only two of them, so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive.",
            "This hotel is the best value going. I'm a seasoned traveller so I have seen it all. Yes the rooms are smaller than normal but how much do you need when your so close to all the attractions. Plus they are like new inside. Went during the middle of the week so didn't have any problems with elevators or staff like some other reviewers had mentioned. The front desk let me check in at 11am so that was a plus, and I used the computer and printer in the upstairs lounge for printing boarding passes. For 85 bucks you can't beat it.",
            "Couldn't ask for a much better location if you want to stay in downtown Chicago and be able to walk around. PROS ============= - Fantastic location. Right next to Michigan Ave. Bridge with the Wrigley Building right across the river. - Very affordable given the location. (Of course, we went for the 4th of July and this is a business hotel chain.) - Cheap and tasty place to have breakfast just outside the hotel. (Corner Bakery Cafe) - Don't need a car if you plan to stay in Chicago. Close to lots of transit. CONS ============= - My wife and I went to Chicago for our honeymoon. Loved the town, but this hotel is not the most romantic. - Somewhat spartan accommodations",
            "The River Hotel occupies floors 3 - 10 of a historic building built in 1928. It is located directly across the street (Whacker) from the Chicago river between Michigan ave and Wabash. In terms of location, this place could not be beat in my opinion. Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park, 'L' trains, many restaurants and bars, all within walking distance. We chose not to rent a car and got around just fine. Additionally, we found the rooms to be clean, comfortable, nicely updated, and good size for a hotel in a downtown area of a major city. If we make it back to Chicago again, this is were we'll stay.",
            "Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel. The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted. Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested. Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there. My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city. All in all a great expericen for the price.",
            "Very nice hotel, everything was nice and the staff was very helpful. My only complaint was how exceedingly small my single room was. It worked fine, but there truly was very little room within the room. Oh, and perhaps that is the reason the bed seemed short even for my 5'-4\" height?! ?",
            "River Hotel is priced like most Chicago hotels - expensive - almost 200/night, but doesn't deliver anywhere near the service expected for that service. Most disappointing was the room - it was barely could fit in the queen bed that was in there. Its almost as if they cut the rooms in half some time ago to maximize occupancy. It was evident this is what they did as the the dividers between rooms were paper thin - I could here everything happening in the next room including people talking. Most motel chains like Best Westerns etc. have better room size so go there for a 1/3 of the money. Or spend the 200/night and go somewhere else. Further the maid service people knocked at my door around noon - I asked them to come back - they never did."

The rooms although small are beautifully designed, comfortably and stylishly equipped with almost everything, except perhaps a fridge. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Restaurant in hotel is good for breakfast, but lunch and dinner have a lackluster menu with inconsistent quality. It's a great value for the wonderful location - right in the middle of everything. It's much better than many of the chain hotels in the area.",

Restaurant in hotel is good for breakfast but best avoided for lunch and dinner for its lackluster menu with inconsistent quality."

The building was either grand or impressive, with polished brass appointments. It is a old brownstone building. The building is historic and has thin walls, so guests can hear noise from other rooms easily. There are a lot of people staying at the hotel, so it can be busy. The rates are very low, so it is a great deal. The elevators can be slow. The building was not as pictured online.",

            "We just got back from NY and we stayed two nights at this location. It was perfect. Close to penn station (10 min. walk) and Time square (10 min. walk). It was clean. The room are very big, the only problem was that the sofa bed was not comfortable at all. It would be time to have their mattress to be change. Don't expect to get a nice room cause it's very old fashion decor. The only problem was we didn't have internet.",
            "The front desk and the management was a nightmare! I booked a one bedroom suite with 2 beds. When I checked in they refused to honor the booking. They placed me in a room with one bed. I needed two beds so they agreed to put another bed in the room for an extra 20 dollars per night. I had no choice so I complied. I spoke to the manager and she said that they DO NOT honor any on-line bookings. Although I voiced my displeasure I received no satisfaction whatsoever. In all my travels I have never been more upset. The hotel was not a bad place to stay but the fact is they misrepresented themselves. To make matters worse a friend of mine checked in after me and had ordered a single bed but they placed him in a room with 2 beds. Unfortunately I was unaware of his situation until it was not worth the move. Be careful when dealing with these people. I believe they actually scammed me for the extra 100 dollars.",
            "We had a corner room and lots of windows which was great. It had a full kitchen, a bedroom with 2 queen beds plus a separate living room with sofa bed and dining table. Very spacious for 3 adults. The front desk employees were very efficient and helpful. This was definitely my most relaxing NYC trip because it was like having a home to go to after tramping all over the city.",
            "The Murray Hill East Suites is apartment living at it's best in NYC. Essentially, it was larger than a typical studio apartment in NYC. The hotel or apartotel is located 3 blocks from Grand Central Station on a quiet street. However, there are places to eat on the main street Lexington, convenience store close by, and the W Hotel Bar is on the same street. There was nothing spectacular about the lobby since it is what you would expect for a high rise apartments. We didn't get any rude staff and was satisfied with their service. Beware regarding the elevator since it is small, but the room makes up for it in space. While the Milford Plaza takes you back to the 70's, the Murray Hill East Suites takes ou back to the 80's. At first glance it feels like a high rise retirement home with it's floral decor and convalescent furniture. However, there is much space in the room and was suprisingly clean. The room we stayed at had 2 full size bed and a sleeper sofa. The kitchen was added bonus, which included a full size fridge, cookware, and dishes. The whole motif is very 1980's, but made you feel like a part of a sitcom. If the owner of this building ever decide to go moderne/minimal or just change the floral textiles, the hotel would have an amazing potential. Other than the retro ambiance of this hotel, there was minimal negatives since it was clean and comfortable. I would reccomend this place for a large group and also reccomend a needed upgrade to atleast 90's IKEA level in hopes for the Murray Hill East Suites to embrace the Millenuem.",
            "As most others have dreamt about traveling abroad as an foreign country or an island, my dream was to visit New York. I finally arrived to New York, not know what to expect. We decided to stay at this hotel, mainly because it has a kitchenette with a great price, especially since we were not planning on staying indoors that often. Upon arrival, the hotel was better than we thought, from the very kind doorman to the spacious (not common in NY) hotel room. We were upgraded to the Queensize bedroom., which had three closet spaces including iron/board. cozy bathroom w/ courtesy toiletries and kitchenette w/ mini refrigerator and oven with all essential cookware (no microwave though). They even had a small area for dining and living room. The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect ! 5-10 minute taxi or walking distance to everywhere...Times Square, Grand Central Terminal, Chrysler Bldg, and Rockafeller Center. The lady in the front office even mailed out my postcards for me. There is no internet in the room, but if you have an laptop with WIFI you can go downstair in the hotel lobby / waiting area, you will receive free internet there. Or in the same block, there is a Fedex/Kinko's, where you can pay for internet. This is the perfect hotel for the New York experience, minus the hussle and bussle of the city. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel for any future stays.",
            "This apartment hotel meets minimum standards for cleanliness and habitability, but it is not a four star hotel. The interior is old, the rooms/apartments even older. The staff is pleasant but not well-trained and often don't know what to do about basic problems ...like replacing missing utensils in apartment kitchens. It is not a bad place for extended stays if you can negotiate a good rate. Rack rates (even with usual NYC 30% discount) are ripe-offs. Ask for at least 50% discount more for long stays. We negotiated about 65% discount on rack rates for 10 day stay.",
            "We spent this past weekend at Murray Hill Suites and were thoroughly disappointed. Our room was uncomfortably warm and the air conditioning was not yet working so we opened the windows (they only open 6 inches) for cooling only to hear the very loud street noise. We did not sleep well. The shower had adequate water pressure, but did not have an anti-scalding shower taps so you had to be ready for a significant shower change. I can't imagine a hotel not having anti-scalding shower taps! We wanted to separate the first night charge since we were expensing it out and were told we could when we checked in. But, the person (not the same as the first) said we could not since it was already 'posted'. Well, he could have unposted it, but chose not too and really could not have cared less. We are saddened by this experience since we really like the neighborhood (great restaurants, stores and close to everything). We will stay here again.",
            "My partner and I spent a night at the Murray Hill East Suites and were thrilled with the size of the suite, especially considering the reasonable rate. Cleanliness is, of course, important and the hotel definitely passed the test. The staff and doorman were helpful, courteous, and friendly. We'll be staying there again in mid-February.",
            "My son (25) is working in Philadelphia so my wife and I flew from the UK to join him for a long weekend in New York. We scoured the net for suitable suites and luckily picked this hotel. We read horror stories of cramped hotel rooms overrun with mice and roaches but we found this hotel to be very clean with a large bedroom and a roomy separate living room with a sofa bed, tables, chairs etc. The kitchen was small but had anything you needed and the bathroom was very clean with towels replaced every day. We stayed in room 303 which was at the front of the building and was very quiet apart from a loose manhole cover on the road outside that made a noise on the seldom occasions a car passed. But after walking NY all day we had no problems sleeping. The hotel is close to the Empire State building and the top could be seen from our window and Times Square was a pleasant stroll away.",
            "Our family of 4 found the suites to be very comfortable, spacious and clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Location was great - parking garage around the corner, short walk to Grand Central, Bryant Park, subway. We had a view of the Empire State Building from our room. It was like having an apartment in the city.Decor is dated, but rooms are clean and spacious.",
            "I've stayed at Murray Hill twice in the past year. As an ex-New Yorker, I love being NOT in Times Square, but in a more residential/normal retail part of town. Grand Central is just a few blocks away, and there are restaurants & delis all over the place. Both my rooms have been clean and comfortable. Decor isn't the most modern (think your aunt from the upper east side) but I love the extra space and the dining room table. It's been a perfect place for business trips - easy to get to and from almost anywhere in the city.",
            "We booked these apartments knowing the location would suit our needs, they were in a fantastic place. The rooms are quiite basic but meet everyone's needs, remember you only sleep and shower in a NYC room! We had 5 adults in our 1 bedroom suite and there was loads of room. Our friends stayed as well and they had a view of the Empire State, we were on the opposite side and it was a very quiet room on the 11th floor, again for NYC unusual. The staff were excellent, recommendations, booked our return taxt far cheaper than direct booking $40 less for the return trip to JFK. We were 20 minutes from Times Sq, 15 from Empire State, 5 from Grand central so excellent. Would recommend and excellent value for money",
            "We chose this location after doing much research here on Tripadvisor forums. The price for #9 Murray Hill East was half the cost of a tiny NYC hotel room. It was a 3 room apartment with room enough to sleep our family comfortably. We love having the space and the location was great for all of the normal NYC activities. We liked the 24 hour diner, Scotty's, a few steps away. It was mostly quiet and even sleeping with our windows open, the street noise wasn't too distracting. The decor, as other's have mentioned is outdated but the place is clean and is well-maintained daily. The king bed in the bedroom was extremely comfy as were the pillows. I've since ordered my own Fossfill pillows for home(yes, I looked at the tags; no, I didn't steal any pillows!) We would definately stay here again. Beats, being cramped in a small hotel room with kids anyday!",
            "This venue is brilliantly situated, a walk from many of the major New York attractions and a couple of blocks from the Grand Central subway station. We occupied a suite, with my wife and I in the main bedroom and my daughter on a fold out bed in the lounge. This arrangement proved very satisfactory and comfortable for all three of us. The apartment was well furnished, with very comfortable beds, a useful kitchen and very adequate bathroom, with instant hot water in the morning. The apartment was serviced every day and left immaculate. Another excellent feature was free internet available in the lobby (you could pay for internet in your room, but I can't see why you would do this). Laundry facilities were available, but, with four very cheap laundries with in a block or so, it is hardly worth availing oneself of this facility. The Murray Hill also has a very adequate gym and workout facility. The cost was extremely reasonable for a facility of this standard. I would heartily recommend Murray Hill East Suites to any visitor to New York.",
            "My wife and I just returned from a weekend in NYC. We stayed at the Murray Hill Ease Suites on 39th between Lexington and 3rd Ave. We truly enjoyed our stay. The room was a large L-shaped efficiency with a wall of windows, and contained a living room setup (couch, chair coffee table, TV) a small kitchen w/ fridge, sink and appliances and a queen-sized bed. There were tons of closets, and a small to average-sized bathroom. The room's decor was a bit outdated, but very clean and neat. The hotel seems more like a small apartment building than a hotel. We paid $170/night on Priceline and it felt like a bargain. The staff was courteous and even gave us an extended checkout time at the last minute. The Murray Hill area is relatively quiet by NYC standards and there were plenty of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops close by. The hotel itself has no restaurant or bar, and that is a negative for some, but it didn't faze us in the least. It seems like it would be an affordable option for a family, but if your looking for a bunch of ammenities or a romantic hotel, you'd probably do better elsewhere. I would definately recommend the Murray Hill East and wouldn't hesitate to stay there in the future.",
            "We booked this hotel because of the favorable reviews on the Tripadvisor website and we were not disappointed. Our only awkward moment came when we checked in and were told that our confirmed $149/day rate was only for AAA members, which we weren't. But the hotel did accept our confirmation rate, which was good because the New York City hotel tax is an impressive 19% by now. We had a good-sized, comfortably furnished room on the ground floor with a queen bed, bathroom with bathtub, large closet with plenty of hangers, an iron and an ironing board, and a fully equipped kitchenette with complementary coffee, tea, creamer, and sugar. There is a large supermarket nearby where we could buy groceries and deli. There were also several coffee shops and restaurants. We could walk to Grand Central to the subway. The room was quiet and very clean. The staff was helpful. We would certainly stay there again.",
            "The location of this hotel, plus a kitchen, sold me. My suite was spacious, with a full kitchen including stove, microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher, dishes, utensils, pots and pans and coffee maker. There was a table and two chairs for eating, plus a sofa tucked in a corner. The bathroom was well appointed and everything was in working order. To my knowledge, there was no individual control over the room's temperature but it didn't present much of a problem as it was mostly a comfortable temperature. The king sized bed and pillows were moderately comfortable. The internet service, which I ordered from my room, was dodgy and I didn't have time for a technician to come up to sort it out, so I never did get it. The hotel is definitely older and could use a sprucing up, but it was clean. I walked everywhere I went, the location was so convenient, so I saved money on transportation as well as eating breakfast and lunch in the suite. I felt it was a bit pricey, however--for this money I could have stayed at the 4-star Carlton, or my usual favorite, the Affinia Shelburne, also in the area and more luxurious. This might be a good choice for travel with children given the extra space and the ability to prepare meals.",
            "I just stayed at the Murray Hill East Suites on East 39th and Lexington in NYC. I was amazed, this suite cost me $ 170.00 for one night and the place was amazing. The room was huge for a NYC hotel, the beds were clean and comfortable, there was a nice firm loveseat in the room, and a small, but totally functional kitchenette. The kitchenette was clean and totally stocked - plates, cups, wine glasses, silverware, pots and pans, dish drainer, and dish cloth. The bathrooms were small, but totally workable and clean - huge shower. Everything was clean and tidy. The staff were great - and with such a small number of staff members - the staff really got to know the people staying. There was a small, but nice gym in the basement. This hotel is in a mostly residential neighborhood, so the noise level was minimal. There are a number of great and cheap restaurants on either 3rd or Lexington along with a reasonably priced grocery mart on the corner. Since this hotel is a suite - there was a lot of families staying and the noise level in the early evening was sometimes above average - but the place was silent by 7 pm most of the time. The furniture in the suite has been well used, however it made the place feel more like being at home than at a hotel. This hotel is not for anyone who wants the $ 500 a night NYC hotel experience, however if you want a clean, comfortable, and good priced place to relax - this is the place to go!",
            "We got a good deal through Priceline and didn't know what to expect. The staff were friendly and helpful. They would hail a cab for us when we needed it, which was helpful during rush hour and peak times. The room was clean and quiet. The suite was nice so when my fiancee wanted to go to bed early and I wanted to still watch a late game, we both could do what we wanted. The location was great....short cab rides to many attractions and walking distance to Grand Central and the subway. Highly recommended for travellers on a budget.",
            "I've stayed here a few times over the years. Don't expect a full-service hotel. That's not what this is. These are excellent short-term serviced apartments though. If you need a base in NYC for a few days, or even a couple of weeks, they're clean, safe and well maintained. I've always had a very large room and a small kitchen, which means I've been able to fix my own breakfast before heading out in the morning. There are ample delis, a Kinkos and Grand Central just around the corner. I've found the staff to be helpful, but not overly outgoing. There's no bar or restaurant - if you're looking for somewhere practical it's a great place to stay.",
            "My sisters and I stayed in the Murray Hill Suites during our stay in Manhattan. It is one of the nicest apartments I have stayed in. The kitchen is really well equipped, it even as a dishwasher. The apartments are a really good size and the bed was huge. there is maid service daily, which meant a clean apartments and lots of fresh towels. The apartment also has quite a good fitness centre for those who are not worn out by walking around Manhattan.",
            "Room was clean and pretty big for NYC standards, TV, hair dryer, additional blankets and all first necessities were available. Only negative note: we saw several reception staff, friendly and not, but generally not prepared to give information of any sort. Overall if your purpose is tourism and your main need is a reasonable but confy room, then you're in the right place.",
            "Finding a good hotel at a decent rate in New York is often a challenge. The Murray Hill East Suites is exactly what we were looking for. Walking distance to the UN, comfortable spacious suite room with a small kitchen and a cosy living room and very friendly staff. Internet is free in the lobby but there is a charge to use it in the room. We had a few internet disruptions during our stay but not too long. We highly recommend this hotel.",
            "My wife and I enjoyed a one night stay at this location during the Christmas season. It is conveniently located, as it is just off the beaten path of all the major mid-town attractions that you want to expose yourself to during the Holiday. This location is great as far as I'm concerned because it gives you the luxury of being away from all the chaos and crowds when your done exploring the attractions. Hotel staff was wonderful, check in convenient, and accomodations very clean with lots of space in the suite.",
            "Just returned from a wonderful visit to New York City. Stayed in the Murray Hill East Suites. We (two women, 4 girls ages 16, 12, 6 and 5) stayed in a one bedroom suite. We had plenty of room compared to other New York City hotels. The bedroom had two double beds and the sofa made into a queen sized bed. Like the other reviews found some of the furniture to be worn. Our room could have used new mattresses and bed spreads. The rest of the place was just fine. We didn't spend much time in room anyway. The location was great. It was quiet and in a great neighborhood. Grocer on corner. I'm sure he is going to miss us stopping in every day to purchase powdered donuts and chocolate milk. The kitchen was nice to have. Heated up left overs. Thought that the employees were extremely friendly and eager to help us with any questions or request that we had. We had a ball going to Grand Central Station to catch the subway. We got pretty good at it too. It was just a couple of blocks up the street. Scotty's diner around the corner has great food. We just had a great time. Can't wait to stay there again when we come back to NYC. Oh, we had a room on front of building and could see the Empire State Building.",
            "Stayed here 1 night right before Christmas. Although its a large room, that's about the only great thing. There's a kitchen, fridge, etc which I'm sure is handy, but we didn't really use. Large seating area, with old dingy furniture. Bed was awful, with a dip in middle. Bedding was just a sheet and blanket. Bathroom was tiny. Heat had no thermostat. It was either hot or cold. Overall there is potential but needs a major upgrade. Location is decent. Not in tourist area which is nice.",
            "We stayed at this hotel monday june 4 2007 - wednesday june 6 2007. After taking forever to decide on a hotel and anyone who is deciding on going to New York City, you probably understand how hard it is to find an affordable hotel. THIS is the hotel to choose! its is located right by Grand Central and about a 10min walk to Times Square which is not a bad walk whether your doing it in the day or late at night. Location is close to Macy's and a big shopping district. The Hotel was a great surprise! To our great surprise we had be upgraded and the room was HUGE! a large living room a good sized kitchen and large bedroom with 2 double beds. Travelling with 4 people it was a great size! We had our luggage lost upon arrival so the hotel was very helpfull to make our stay more comfortable. There is lots of places to eat in the area! if you walk towards lexington. Scotties is a GREAT dinner for breakfast or late night dinner and they deliver to the hotel!! If your going to New York City and looking to do some site seeing then consider doing the \"Grey Line double decker bus tour\" it is a hop-on-hop-off pass and it is a great deal! There is a stop at the UN building which is pretty close to the hotel! The Beds were comfortable and the airconditioning worked great! The only thing wrong was the tub collected water when having a shower but thats not even a big problem. There is a stove and a dishwasher in the kitchen and the housekeeping is VERY prompt in the early morning! We would deffinately stay here again, everyone was very nice and the location was worth it for what we got in our room just for being a little outside of Times Square.",
            "This hotel is located in a great neighborhood - very close to Grand Central Station and felt very safe. I stayed by myself the first 3 nights and felt very comfortable leaving and coming back after midnight. There are some amazing restaurants & bars close by and the room had a full kitchen so our leftovers didn't go to waste. We asked for a smoking room & ended up with a room on the 12th floor with a huge terrace and views of the water and the Empire State Building. I couldn't have been happier with this hotel. The staff was very nice & helpful and the room was very clean & HUGE - quite unexpected in the middle of Manhattan. I will definitely stay here again.",
            "The Murray Hill East Suites, located on 39th and 3rd in Manhattan has got to be one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The d\u00e9cor is almost indescribably horrible. All of the furniture, bedding and appliances (inc. the TV) are from the 70\u2019s. The carpet is sea green, the Curtains are Black with a floral print. And on top off their lumpy beds and old pillows are Pink Sheets, is a Black floral print duvet covers that come complete with a weathered \u201cButt Print\u201d at the edge of the bed to showcase where people have been sitting down over the last 40 years! Ewww! One positive\u2014room is a pretty decent size for Manhattan, and It does have an on suite kitchenette. The bathroom is Tiny but Clean. (watch out for the hair dryer that looks like a vacuum!) Do yourself a favor, and spend a few extra bucks for a place that is 1. In a decent location 2. doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201cantique\u201d and 3. Carries simple amenities such as a Razor. (yes, that\u2019s right. If you forget your toothbrush at the Murray Hill East, your SOL buddy!)",
            "We have stayed here 6/7 times in the past and we have never been disappointed. The rooms are an amazing size for NY and very reasonably priced for the location. Easy walking distance to Grand Central Station, 42nd Street and even Times Square. The Empire State Building is also within reasonalble walking distance. Check in is always quick and efficient. Staff are pleasant and polite.The rooms have been updated since our last visit and have new carpets and decor. Beds are large and comfortable and kitchen facilities are helpful. A home away from home! - There is good local eating and we love the 'local' feel of the area as opposed to other more tourist focused parts of the city. This hotel is well looked after and spotlessly clean. It has good wifi connection and flat screen TVs. This is our preferred accommodation when we are in the city. We have stayed elsewhere, but nowhere else is as good and we will always stay here is there are rooms available. We have also recommended the Murray Hill East Suites to a number of friends who agree with us that this is the place to stay in NY city. Tip - As it was very hot in the city during our visit, we did not fancy using the subway, so we took the M103 bus which runs downtown on Lexington through to City Hall.",
            "This was my second stay at Murray Hill Suites, both times I booked through the website \"apartments2book.com\". I highly recommend this hotel. Had a one bedroom (king) with small kitchen, dining area and living room with a great view of the Empire State building. While the decor is dated, the rooms are very clean and spacious. The staff is always so nice and helpful. Close to Grand Central station for the subway. Good restaurants and a neighborhood grocery just down the street. My last visit in fall 2006 we had a larger one bedroom (two queen beds).",
            "We just came back from a fantastic week in NY--what a great place for 2 moms & 2 daughters celebrating Spring Break in NY to stay ! I read lots of reviews on this site before booking our hotel & I'm glad I did. For us, this was a perfect choice--because of the reasonable rates, we had plenty of money left for shopping. We loved the spaciousness of our 1 bedroom suite--lots of room for all of our clothes & shoes, etc. The location was great--very quiet & in a nice neighborhood where we felt quite safe. We walked to the corner for the best bagels & cream cheese every morning on our way to Grand Central Station. We picked up snacks & bottled water at the corner store on our way back every nite. Several other restaurants & a delicious deli were in walking distance. We didn't really use the kitchen--just the refrigerator! The staff helped point us in the right direction when we needed to know the best way to head off on our next adventure. We appreciated the cleanliness and excellent maid service every day. Who cares if the bedspread wasn't one we'd have picked out! We'll stay here next time for sure!",
            "We were a party of five: me, my wife, two kids and my mother-in-law. We were looking for two double bedrooms and had an excellent full two-bedroom apartment on 12th floor. By \"full\" I mean FULL: two large bedrooms with two queen beds each, two renovated bathrooms, one LARGE living room with dining room, a full kitchen and, the cherry on the top, a real solarium. The apartment was clean, the furniture is old style 60's in excellent shape. The location is also very good with many restaurants and transportation around. It does not have the services or the \"luxe\" of a 4/5 star hotel but I definitely recommend it.",
            "Reading some of the earlier negative reviews, I wonder If the reviewers stayed at the same hotel we did. The room was huge, we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite when we checked in, very nice and clean. The location can't be beat. On a quiet side street(for New York), close to Grand Central. We booked early and got a great rate for what we received. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and would recommend the Murray Hill East Suites to anyone.",
            "We stayed here for 5 nights with our teenage children. It is in an excellent location and is a very comfortable apartment with all the facilities needed for our stay including kitchen, laundry, gym . It is walking distance to many of the top tourist spots, Times Square, Rockefeller centre, Grand Central Station, Broadway, UN Headquarters, so easy to come back, have a rest then start over again!",
            "Large for New York hotel room with small equipped kitchen. Good for making breakfast and tea and coffee. Several places nearby to buy provisions. Badly let down by television that was out of the ark. Being there for work I spent the evenings relaxing and I like US TV. Sadly for most of my stay there were wavy lines across the screen on most of trhe channels. The receptionist ( I didnt get his name) kept telling me it was a problem the cable company had to fix. But by the third day all I was getting was a shrug of the shoulders when I asked when it was going to be fixed. It was still a problem when a left as further 2 days later. Otherwise however the other staff encountered were excellent especially the yoiung lady who arranged for me to move rooms on arrival as the 2nd floor room facing the street I was allocated on arrival was fairly noisy with traffic roaring by at night. The location of the hotel is really good though and the price too. If you are heading to New York to see the sights and hit the shops. Its hard to beat. I would go back provided the TV works!",
            "I tried this hotel over the President's Day Weekend with my family. Staff was polite but seemed disinterested in what they were doing. Hotel's location was great but the room was not what I expected for a \"suite.\" Sofa bed was in terrible shape to the point that my son did not want to sleep on it and chose to close the bed and sleep on the sofa. This is an older building and like many other reviews, the decor is outdated but that had no influence on my opinion of the room. I actually found the building rather charming. This is a good traveler's hotel, if you are looking for somewhere just to sleep between trips out into the city. There is a little kitchen with a stove and fridge that we did not use so I cannot comment on how well they worked. I didn't dislike the hotel, I have stayed in better in for around the same price.",
            "Stayed here mid-September and was very pleased with the place. Three friends on a holiday to NYC & didn't want to share a bed and also wanted to save some cash - this place was perfect. Good price - we paid less than $350 a night for a large 1 bedroom apt on the 14th floor. Room had 2 queen beds, kitchen, lounge area with 2 sofas (one was a fold-out queen bed) and although the decor/furnishings weren't the most modern, it certainly did us. Didn't spend vast amount of time in the room - it is NYC afterall, however, when we did, it was a comfortable experience and certainly less expensive than the alternative, 2 hotel room option!!! Location great, couple of blocks from Grand Central and the conveinence store on the corner of 39th & Lex had most of what we needed + made great sandwiches",
            "Our family of 4 just returned from a 5-night stay at Murray Hill East Suites. It was exactly as I had expected and worked extremely well for us. As previous posters have mentioned, the furniture is a little worn and dated, but everything was very comfortable and the suite was surprisingly spacious for Manhattan. We had 1 bedroom with 2 double beds, a sofa bed in the living room, full kitchen and dining area. Times Square was only 10-15 minutes walk, and Grand Central Station was very nearby. There was a supermarket just around the corner, where we were able to purchase juice, cereal, milk and snacks, essential with a hungry teenager in the group! The staff was very courteous and requests for extra towels and kitchen utensils were met promptly. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. And the price was unbeatable too!",
            "The staff were most accomodating. I arrived early and was able to check in before the published time of 3 pm. The decor is a little dated, however the room was clean. There was not a 24 hour doorman as I had expected. Overall, I think that it represents a good value, if you don't require a lot of services and aren't offended by the older decor, I would highly recommend it.",
            "The hotel was all right for New York standards... However, my sister had rashes after sitting on the couch (may be dustmites). Our family stayed there for 7 nights this past winter. Upon arrival, we were told that we had to pay 85$ a night as we had four people in the party instead of 2, that was an extra $600!!! We could have stayed at a much nicer hotel for the price, but since it was non-refundable, we continued to stay there. The manager was just simply rude. However, the doorman, the accountant and other staff were all right. So just a reminder: if you have more than 2 people in your party, note it down in the reservation to avoid extra charges! Or try to find a hotel that wouldn't charge you so much more!",
            "My wife and I spent a week here about two years ago. The location of the hotel is really great, and you can easily walk to many Manhattan attractoions from here. It's also close to Grand Central. The hotel itself was a bit worn, but hey, who travels to NY to stay in the hotel room? Not me! The room was big and had a small kitchen, so I have to say I'm very pleased with my stay here.",
            "This hote is fabulous. I stayed here 7 nights in late September 09. The kitchen was great, and featured a small fridge, oven and cook top, as well as utensils. The room was massive, and had a lounge area, separate bedroom and bathroom. The hotel was clean and the service staff were very efficient. There is a laundry room, although I didn't use it. The gym was small but there was only ever 1 other person using it whilst I was there so there were no problems. It had 2 treadmills, a weights machine, bike, stepper and hand weights. Wireless internet is available in the lobby, although quite a few times I had trouble connecting to it. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again and reccommend it to any travellers wanting to visit Manhattan. Only 10 minutes walk to Times Square and 5 minutes to Grand Central Station. Loved it!",
            "I loved the location. We rented the one bedroom suite. It was VERY spacious, of course the outdated decor could be redone (but it was clean and well kept) and for $200.00 a night during the holiday season you can not find a hotel in a better location! Within walking distance to Time Square and Rockefeller Center...The staff was top notch! They allowed us a late check out! The manager was very helpful as well! I would stay here again! Nice lobby! I think you will be well pleased with the hotel for a business or family trip!",
            "I've stayed here many times and alwasy had a good experience. Admittedly the rooms are a bit dated but they are very big and usually at a very reasonable price. The smallest room which i beleive is the junior suite is still a large room with sitting room area, kitchen and 3 wardrobes. I'm not sure why there are so many wardrobes but there you go! The staff are fairly competent but there is never much need to interact with them. Internet is either $7 a day or $50 a month which is expensive in my opinion as i only ever stay there for a week so have to pay $50. However the fact i keep copming back means that i would recommend this place.",
            "It's a former apartment hotel, and my wife and I had a bedroom, living room, and kitchen. TV is old as are building and furnishings, but it is clean and neat. Staff is very helpful, and location is convenient to entire Midtown East, UN, and Grand Central. Plenty of enjoyable restaurants nearby, especially Cibo around the corner. No luxury, but a great value and wonderful space.",
            "Selected this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and was not disappointed. I and my 20-year-old son stayed here for a weekend. First, it is quiet, a rare attribute in New York. No traffic, no loud bars near-by, no dumpsters emptied at 4 a.m. Area is relatively quiet but only three blocks from Grand Central Station so subways to anywhere are only 10 minutes away. The hotel is a half-block from 3rd Avenue where cabs are plentiful. The theater district is a 10-minute walk to Grand Central and 10 minutes on the subway shuttle. The rooms are fairly large for New York with a small refrierator, sink and stove which we never used. Maid service was excellent and the front desk was helpful. One small piece of advice; do not ask them to call a cab for you for an airport trip the night before you need to leave. Hotels cannot call cabs so they called a car service for us. The fee was $50 to LaGuardia instead of the $24 cab ride. Not really a big deal. This is not a resort hotel so if you have five little kids looking for a pool and a game room, this is not for you. Quiet and convenient and reasonably priced.",
            "I stayed here about a year ago and the room on the second floor was garbage. Torn and stained linens, dirty bathroom and carpets. This time I was on the sixth floor and things were much nicer. I'm not sure if the fixed things up or I was just lucky. You can tell this is a former apartment building. Bathroom was clean and functional. Shower was so-so. Kitchen with all necessary utensils (pot, pans, glasses, silverware) is a nice plus. There was only one small tv in the living room sitting on a cart. A bedroom tv would be nice. Orbitz had the room for $119. Rack rate was $159. Check before you book. There is a small fitness center and laundry in the basement. As the title says, thoroughly adequate.",
            "A great location- very handy to everything in New York-only about a 10 minute walk to Time Square. Also A quick walk to Grand Central Station which made things even easier. Our room was in original condition but very clean and tidy, and also extremely spacious. It was more like a loft or studio than a hotel serviced hotel room.",
            "I liked being here, because the rooms are definitely larger than the typical New York hotel, and does have a 'long stay' feel to it-- what with the little kitchen, etc. Nice large windows-- they don't look out at anything great, but it's nice to have big windows. Yes, true, it is dated. Not in such a terrible way-- its just not chic and cool by any means at all. We had asked for long-term rates and were told unreasonably high prices, so I'm surprised by the other reviewer who stated that they were able to negotiate lower rates for longer stays. I would like to know why the disparity in responses from the staff on this. I would certainly be interested in staying here for a longer stay, but what's the deal with reduced cost request getting a Yes or a No? If management reads this, please respond. Thanks.",
            "I spent 5 nights at Murray Hill Suites in December and was extremely impressed with the whole set up. I initially thought of an apartment/suite as it was a cheaper option to a hotel room in Manhattan in December but on reflection this was a better option all round; the room was huge (bigger than my apartment when I used to live in NY), couch and chair, dining table and chairs, loads of closet space and a small but serviceable kitchenette which was well stocked with utensils. The bathroom was small but tidy and well maintained. From the moment I arrived (very late on a Fri night) to when I checked out the following Wednesday I found all the staff (concierge, reception and housekeeping) to be extremely friendly and helpful. The room was quiet. I've read that people find the front facing rooms noisy - I was facing the front, 39th St - but for the middle of New York City I have to say the noise was minimal. I also liked the huge windows providing lots of natural light. There are delis and a liquor store just a block away and its perfect for walking to Grand Central. I can't recommend this place highly enough and I will be making this my first choice for future trips to NY.",
            "Thumbs Up for Murray Hill East Suites! Our family of four stayed five nights, April 5-10. Our check-in was done by a pleasant fellow, and the doormen were always helpful and nice. Our 8th floor room had two double beds and a pull-out sofa. The rooms were clean and having a kitchen was great, not that we cooked but it was nice to have breakfast and or snacks in our suite. The location was perfect! Just a 6-7 minute walk to Grand Central Station where you can catch the subway. A grocery store, bagel shop & deli were less than a block away. Bus transportation to the airport had a stop five minutes away. If your in to walking you can reach many sights by foot in less than 20 minutes. We requested a non-smoking room and they fulfilled our request. We were on the street side so we did notice a little street noise, I would ask for the back side of the building next time. Although the room decor was a little dated it was comfortable and clean, and we will take clean anyday over decor. The bathroom was small and the shower water pressure average (I would suggest they reduce the size of the trash can in the bathroom so it fits between the toilet & sink) A TV in the bedroom would be the only thing we would add to our wish list. Our charges were correct, no problem with our bill. We viewed this as a family friendly hotel, a family of 6 could stay very comfortably in the suite. We are hooked on the location and the cleanliness and would revisit this hotel.",
            "We booked the Murray Hill East Suites through apartments2book.com and were completely thrilled with our experience. We were staying in NYC the same weekend as the NYC marathon, so hotel rooms were at a premium. This hotel offered a comfortable, extremely spacious room with lots of storage, and kitchenette for much less than others. I couldn't get over the size of the studio room. It was twice the size and half the cost of what we would have paid closer to Times Square. Being so close to Grand Central Station was a bonus, as it was an easy 5-minute walk away. We walked to the Empire State Building (about 10-15 minutes) as well as to the theater district for shows (about 20-30 minutes, depending on location in district). If we didn't feel like walking, it was about a $10 cab ride or $2 per person subway ride to anywhere. The neighborhood was very residential, and we had breakfast one morning at Bloom's Deli (corner of E 40th & Lexington), which had enormous, flavorful portions in a mom & pop setting. Be sure to grab a slice of cheesecake at Junior's (originally in Brooklyn, they now have a storefront in Grand Central Station as well as a diner on Shubert Alley in the Theater District) too. The only drawback was that you could hear traffic at all hours, but it kind of added to the experience of being in New York City. Our room overlooked the street, so I wonder if being in a room that overlooked the alley would have been quieter. The room decor is a bit 1990's, but it's spotless and in good condition. The overall room to relax in was so great, so who cares about the vintage?",
            "The hotel was good. It was clean and quiet, except that the noise of door-closing did disturb us a little bit. The housekeeping was very prompt and efficient. The room was spacious and comfortable. We used the laundry service too. We tried the breakfast in a nearby cafe (Frontier) which was good as well.",
            "I have stayed in many hotels in midtown Manhattan but this will be my homebase from now on. The suite is very roomy and comfortable--as a business traveler, I enjoyed being able to spread my work on the desk and make the living room my office. The kitchenette was convenient and the nice grocery store around the corner on 3rd made it even easier to eat on the cheap. The only drawback to the kitchen was the lack of a microwave. This is the best price per square foot you'll find! My first floor room actually betrayed its apartment origins with a large unfurnished patio. The doorman was prompt and courteous, the staff friendly and knowledgeable. Grand Central Station is the nearest subway station--if you're unfamiliar with the area, look for the subtle entrance directly on Lexington Avenue just after you cross 42nd on the right. This will save you a half block. I was able to easily walk to both the Flatiron and the theatre district (20-30 minutes). The immediate dining options are mediocre (Saga on Lexington was good but the help was disguntled).",
            "I got a room from hotwire and got a great deal. It's very convenient with a very large room. The only complaint I have is that the room has no internet connection which is inconvenient, and it is still a three star hotel! I think it would not be a good place to stay if you are there on business. In fact my husband had to go to the lobby to get wireless connection since he had to work.",
            "It would be extremely helpful if this hotel had a website. We stayed at this hotel on a business trip, because there weren't a lot of other hotels available in the company's price range. The hotel's location is great. This is my third trip to NY in the past year, and compared to the other hotel we stayed at, this hotel was very quiet with very little street noise. The area is good, it's a residential area, with an outstanding little Italian restaurant just across the street. The front desk staff was fairly nice. They were going through shift change as we got there, and we were never acknowledged by the female clerk, but the male clerk was very nice. When we got into our room, we noted it was very clean. The room desperately needed a decorating update.....looks like it was last done in the 1980s, and the TV is probably about 20 years old. Both beds were very comfortable, but the sheets were a bit tattered, and the bottom side of the comforter looked like it hadn't been washed for six months. On the second morning, we never received our wake-up call......the front desk claimed that the phone was off the hook/busy, but it was not. Bottom line is, if you're looking for anything with frills, this is not the hotel for you. If you're looking simply for a place to sleep at night in a nice quiet neighborhood, this will work for you.",
            "I just got back from a trip to New York where I stayed at the Murray Hill East Suites. The hotel is right in the middle of everything...Grand Central Station, the Empire State Building, Times Square are all within walking distance for those of you who like to walk. The room was clean The staff was friendly And it was one of the less expensive hotels in Manhattan...where everything is expensive anyway. I stayed there because I didn't want to have to take a taxi everywhere I went so I thought something centrally located would be good. But I got to know the subway system quickly and if I had to do it all over again, I'd probably stay somewhere cheaper in Brooklyn and just take the Subway into the center of town. Subways runs round the clock and can get you almost anywhere you need to go. Plus New York is a pretty safe city",
            "We booked our 3 nights stay based on the discounted price for Manhattan. Is near to grand central. Room was Ok as per new york's standards but had a full kitchenette. Staff didnt have our room ready for 4 hours even after us calling from the airport and they confirming it was ready. Door man was a real rude fellow probably frustrated by having to work on the 1st of Jan. The housemaid's trolley was parked next to elevator on the narrow passage leading to our room for the entire duration of our 3 night stay. Receptionist wasnt a real help in booking our cab for our return to JFK.",
            "Stayed 3 nights because we needing to be close to the UN. We booked the studio room but on check-in found they had given our room away and tried to put us in a disgusting SMOKING room. We made it clear what kind of room we booked and made it perfectly clear what time we were checking-in (late) - and we arrived EXACTLY on time. We immediately requested they find us another room, and although they insisted they had no other available room, mysteriously moved us to another room that didn't smell (what happened to being fully booked and NO other rooms available??) The next day we were moved to a 3rd room that had 1 king bed instead of two smaller beds. We consider giving our reserved room to someone else and this deception about being fully booked to be totally unacceptable. This is not professional. I don't know what were the type of rooms we were moved to, but the first two were much larger than the final room where we stayed - the final room had the larger bed. With hindsight I wish we had kept the 2nd room as it had separate living room and bedroom, and was more comfortable (although there were 2 small beds instead of one large). The kitchenette in most (or all) rooms is a great feature, and even the smaller rooms are big-ish sized for NYC. However, the bathroom in the last room was small and VERY tight. Reception staff are typical New Yorkers - curt and unfriendly - compared to say Australia or England. The FREE internet in the lobby was most welcome, and the in-room internet rates were reasonable. We stayed on the back side which was MUCH quieter, and we occasionally were able to connect to a nearby open wireless network, saving us a trip to the lobby for the free internet. I guess overall it was not bad and not great - just average. Our biggest gripes would be (1) the disgusting smokers room, (2) the tiny cramped bathroom, and (3) the less than friendly reception staff.",
            "I was with 6 other friends and we had the 2 bedroom suite. We booked 2 one bedroom units but they offered us the 2 bedroom when we arrived and it suited our needs much better in fact, it was perfect for our needs. The unit was large, bright and quite quiet. We could even open windows for fresh air. We loved being able to sit around the huge living room and relax between outings and before bed. The unit was super clean and comfortable. Furniture and colours are older but nothing was shabby or uncomfortable. Full kitchen made for easy light breakfasts. The location was fabulous - close to subway and walking to main areas easy. A great stay all around.",
            "I have never been to a hotel where the desk staff are so rude and unhelpful. I must say that the doorman was always very pleasant. The suite was very spacious and the kitchen was a real bonus. The decor and the bath need updating, but the rooms were clean. It's disappointing that the first people you meet give you such a negative response.",
            "Stayed with some friends here recently. Thought we would splurge a little with the location - which was nice, in all fairness. That was the only plus: we found front desk staff to be unhelpful and generally unpleasant, and there was just one person on all the time, so we always had to wait forever (this is NYC!). Also, our room had a leaking sink that went all over the bathroom floor. The best was definitely the absolute lack of soundproofing; we all woke up in a panic one night thinking someone was getting killed down the hallway when, in reality, it was just someone laughing. What hotel in any city hasn't figured out the concept of cutting down on noise traveling so as not to irritate hotel guests?? So I guess the only impressive thing, really, was the price. I would NOT stay here again...did I mention they also need to seriously redecorate and update their style?",
            "We stayed in this hotel for a three/four day stay. It is a little off the beaten path, but in NYC you have to walk a lot or take taxies and we did both. To get to the theatre district/restaurant area was only $6.00 and the subway and Grand Central Station was only 5 blocks away. We never felt unsafe and the area is fine. the room was clean, a bit worn, be we paid under $250 for a one bedroom that slept 4 people and was fairly quiet. The sirens were not too close. There was only one TV in the LR, but we were never in the room that much to need it. The cable was not the best, some channels were scrambled, but again no big deal, were were there for sleeping and showering. Got extra towels when requested and maid wervice was fine.",
            "room was larger than expected, but definitely more of a 1-star after the service we recieved. One of the guests in our party had left a shirt behind in the bathroom, however when we called back the next day we were informed by thier housekeeping staff that nothing was found in the room.",
            "We recently stayed at Murray Suites from 20-22 December with three small children and three adults. The two bedroom suite was a perfect fit for the family. The rate for the room was $105 a night for two nights through priceline, however this was for a one bedroom king without a pull-out couch. The manager on duty, seeing a family of six in the lobby instructed us that an upgrade would be 40 dollars additional each night. Part of me was hoping for a free upgrade, but that same part of me was hoping for free parking. (doesn't happen) Rooms have a complete kitchenette and a microwave is available from 8am-4pm.",
            "My teenage daughter and I stayed in the Murray Hill East Suites on a trip to New York in July. For our needs it was fantastic. No, it's not the Ritz, but our large room/suite was clean and nicely furnished. I loved having a living and dining area in which to relax after a long day of sightseeing. The bathroom was recently renovated, and the fully equipped kitchen was fabulous. The staff was very friendly, and we felt extremely safe. The location is also a plus. A three block walk to Grand Central Station could get us to anywhere in the city. There were also numerous restaurants and grocery stores nearby. Needless to say, I would definitely stay there again.",
            "I got this room through Hotwire. For a February stay the place was really cheap for NYC standards (under $100 a night) and the rooms were really spacious for NYC. The place has the charm of a 1970s apartment block, but who's going to spend their time in their hotel room in NYC. Overall I was really satisfied, the rooms were clean, the staff friendly and I would certainly go back again.",
            "Very large rooms, especially for the money in the city. The rooms (most importantly) were great. Small kitchenette with stove and fridge (no microwave), large dinning area, living area (comfortable couch and chair - a small TV, but wasnt in the room much, so that was fine.) Large bedroom area, with a decent view, LOTS of storage, and average bathroom. Serivce was standard. The only minus' were the hallways are tight and dark, and elevator is a little slow. Great location, just minutes by foot to Grand Central, and in a nice, quite neighboorhood. Street vendors selling goods 1 block away was great, and dinners abound within a short walk. We will stay here again!",
            "Fantastic price for an apartment style accomodation, we met people on a tour who paid way more for a small hotel room, the location is very good for walking or getting to the subway, a little noisy with traffic noise at times but hey when your in the city that never sleeps you have to expect that! overall very good.",
            "We spent 5 nights here in March 2007, and were pleased with the accommodation. The apartments were well situated with supermarkets and restaurants located in the same block, and Grand Central Station and Times Square within walking distance. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, and our 1 bedroom apartment was spacious and clean. The only drawbacks were the beds and pillows being a bit soft, and the passage way leading to the rooms smelled musty. Overall, the apartments were affordable and comfortable, and we would stay here again.",
            "this is hardly a nice place. but rooms are clean, sheets were ugly but comfortable. tv was old as dirt but worked. staff was responsive enough. if you're looking for a safe, cheap, centrally located place to stay on manhattan, you could do a lot worse. but this place is certainly nothing special.",
            "Old style apartment hotel - spacious and great location. I've settled all my bills by cash when checked out, and they charge those again to my credit card. I called them to discuss about it and they told me to send an email. I sent the email and never received a response or a reimbursement. Lucky my bills are small, so it's not worth the fight and long distance call.",
            "As I was for business in New York for 4 weeks (8 January to 5 February 2011) and didn\u2019t want to spend all this time in a small overpriced hotel room, I decided to book the Murray Hill Suites. As I didn\u2019t know it and wasn\u2019t sure if I would like it, I initially booked for a week with the possibility to extend. After a few days it was clear to me, and booked for the full 4 weeks. The location is great and I had no problems with the staff at all. They were always very helpful and housekeeping kept my (big) studio impeccable. I agree that this accommodation can not be compared with a big five star fancy new hotel, and the furniture is from the eighties, but the price is very reasonable and I find the suites extremely comfortable. I will for sure recommend this accommodation to all my friends and colleagues who are looking for a clean and affordable place in NYC. I can only repeat, RAY and STAFF thank you very much for making me feeling so welcome.",
            "We spent five nights here the second week of August and were very happy with the room, the price-point and the service. The only draw-back was not having wi-fi available in the room, but it is available in the lobby. I would stay here again in a New York minute.",
            "Group of three ladies stayed here for 5 nights over Thanksgiving 06. I have been to NYC on several occasions, and stayed in various hotels. I decided on the apartment option as I felt I would get more space for my money, and that we did. Very spacious one bedroom apartment. $300 per night for the three of us, which was really good, For all intent and purposes the property is a hotel, with hotel check - in, concierge and daily cleaning and maid service. I would agree with other reviews that the furniture was a little dated, but functional. We had a very well equiped kitchen which was fab for storing juice and snacks. Each day our room was cleaned, towels changed and any dishes put in the dishwasher. The staff were friendly which was nice. Any requests were dealt with promptly. I booked apartment through www.apartments2book.com and the service was very professional, I would not hesitate to book with them and stay at this property again. The area is very nice, quiet around corner is grand central and the chrysler building. Excellent supermarket around corner, diner on opposite street and internet cafe on the other corner.",
            "My husband and I were up in NYC for the Five Boro Bike tour. Room was big enough for both of our bikes. Had a nice little kitchette. Walls are alittle thin, so we could here our neighbors arguing, but other than that a good hotel. NIce staff, allowed us to keep our luggage checked until we got back from the bike tour. Parking was $25 for 24 hours at a nearby garage. The location is really what makes this hotel great. Two blocks from Grand Central, where you can get a subway to anywhere else in the city. A quieter neighborhood than near Times Square. We would definitely stay here again.",
            "This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! The room was huge, with two queen size beds (although we paid for two twin beds), a big couch, two tables, full kitchen, and big bathroom. This room was bigger than my apartment in my hometown. Great value for the money. Very clean, quiet, and it had even free internet and tens of utensils in there.",
            "Our rooms were humongous for NYC and very clean with full kitchen/refrigerator/dishwasher. outdated decor but who cares? you can see the top empire state bldg from the sidewalk outside (and russia! ha ha.) service was amazing with housecleaning every day. The local subway stop was Grand Central (5 mins) so lots of transport options. Our room was actually too warm so we turned the heat off most of the time. though we only went there to sleep, it was a great bonus to come back to a huge suite.",
            "i got to the murray early room was not available yet. i waited 30 min after check in time . room still wasnt ready. 20 min later front desk gave me a key and said go and check if room is ready it was not ready! i finally asked for an upgrade. luckly this room was ready. once i got in my room which was a jr. suit i was very happy with the room. It was very very large compared to the rooms ive stayed in at the raddison lex. very clean. now check out day was not that great. im from orlando so im not use to whistling at cabs. and when i come to new york usualy someone who works at the hotel helps me catch a cab. the door man told me where I could catch a cab. after 5 cabs passesd me i went back to the hotel to complain. the doorman was asked to catch me a cab. and I made it to airport by a hair.",
            "two married couples and a single lady needed clean, comfortable accommodation - not too expensive - for a base while touring in New York and we checked on trip advisor and found fairly good reviews on Murray Hill East Suites. We originally booked one Junior Suite and a one bedroom room because any larger rooms anywhere seemed to be too expensive. When we got to Murray Hill they offered us a two bedroom/two bathroom with sofa bed in living room so we could all go in together. Also had living room/kitchen area. Absolutely perfect! Desk staff and door man very helpful - we needed extra wine glasses and an extra frying pan and they were cheerfully provided. Close to all amenities although the three block walk to Grand Central Station seemed to get longer every time we did it. Had a room on the back of the hotel so very quiet. Kitchenette very limited facilities but great for cooking English Breakfast every day and then loading dishwasher as we went out. All in all would have no hesitation either recommending Murray Hill or staying there again if we ever go back to New York.",
            "We booked 3 adults. (2 beds and a pull out couch). When we arrived there were no linens for the pull out couch. We told the front desk and they said they would take care of it and have someone bring some sheets and pillows up. So we trusted this and went out to visit the town. When we got back at 4am, there were still no linens for the pull out couch. We told the front desk that we STILL do not have any linens. We were then informed that they do not have any more left. Apparently this hotel does not have enough linens to supply for all their guests. Needless to say it was a restless night. If you want to sleep without sheets and a pillow....this is the hotel for you.",
            "I stayed at the Murray Hill Suites in May 2008. I was going to New York for a workshop, and needed a centrally located hotel. I am a woman traveling alone, and a room that was clean, comfortable, and in a safe location was of the utmost importance to me. I booked the room through Hotwire, so I didn't know exactly which hotel I was staying at until I hit \"buy\". I have to say I was pleasantly suprised by the Murray Hill Suites. Prices for hotels in NYC are outragous, and Murray Hill Suites were a bargain for only $165 a night. The room was huge for NYC standards. It had a ton of closet space, and the little kitchenette was perfect for storing snacks and drinks in the fridge. I did not use the stove, but I thought how nice that would be if I wanted to heat up water for tea or leftovers. The room was so clean. I looked for the dreaded hotel bedbugs, and found only pristine sheets. So it is not an uber trendy boutique hotel, with modern furnishings. The bed was quite comfortable, and the air conditioning worked great. I was met every evening with a clean, cool room. The staff was quite friendly and knowledgable. If you are looking for a decent room, in a good location, for a reasonable price in New York City, don't hesitate to book here.",
            "Went with my two adult daughters to NY and got a spacious one-bedroom (2 beds in the bedroom and a pull-out sofa in the living room) for the weekend at what we thought was a fair price. But when we opened the sofa-bed and saw the dingy mattress with all the springs visible under a worn-out layer of fabric, we were appalled. We flipped each other for who would have to try to sleep on that thing. The double beds in the bedroom were acceptable but not so great, either -- with saggy mattresses that definitely needed to be replaced. The kitchenette hadn't been cleaned well; the microwave was dirty inside; we hadn't been given a full set of towels; the TV remotes didn't work and the TV was left unplugged (we had to hunt for the outlet to plug it back in). Also, we were told the hotel had Wifi but they forgot to mention that the Wifi works only while you're in the lobby. A few good things: the hotel is very centrally located, easy to walk to lots of places, it's relatively quiet, and we thought the staff seemed nice .... if a bit overworked. But it's not a great bargain hotel when the beds are so old and saggy that no one can get a good night's sleep! If they just updated the beds, TVs and furnishings, I would have a lot of good things to say. But right now, I'd say it's not a good deal.",
            "We stayed here for 6 days in a 1 bedroom suite: welcoming lobby and staff, 2 elevators to floors. Although the corridor was a bit unprepossessing when we opened the door to the suite we were really pleasantly surprised. It was spacious and well-laid out, with a huge bedroom with kingsize bed, and a double roll-out in the sitting room, which easily accommodated our 16 year-old daughter. There is a small kitchen with cooker, microwave (no instructions! ), tv, dishwasher and some crockery and cutlery, though few utensils. Bathroom was fine: compact but perfectly adequate, and water was hot though it needed to run. Hairdryer provided which was good in view of different voltage from UK. It isn't luxurious, but it is very comfortable and nicely located, and ideal for families with teenagers. 2 blocks from Grand Central Station (fantastic) and subway, a D'Agostino round the corner with lots of fresh and appealing food (a bit pricey but what city isn't? ), a Fedex internet 'cafe' 2 doors down..... Great and highly recommended.",
            "We booked via Ebookers.com after trying to pick from a huge list of NY hotels!! What appealed was price, location, reviews and room sizes. To re-iterate what has been said before, yes the decor is quite dated and the lift (elevator) was a bit hit and miss! However the rooms were spotlessly clean, a fantastic size for New York and ideally located. They are a brisk 10 mins walk to Grand Central or a more leisurely stroll up to 5th Avenue and then onwards either up or down town. There was a fabulous diner, Bloomers, for breakfast (try the \"famous\" Eggs Benedict), a lovely Italian and a great Japanese restaurant that we tried, all within five mins walk. There is also a convenience store on the corner which stocks everything you could need (including umbrella's when we got stuck on a rainy day). Our room faced out onto 39th Street with a great view of The Empire State building. There was the odd occasion a car woke me in the night, but in the main I was impressed with how quiet it was. If you are looking for good value for money, good location, clean rooms and friendly service then I would definitely recommend this hotel.",
            "5 of us traveled to New York at the start of December and stayed in the Murray Hill Suites. We had a 1 bed suite and all we can say was that it was excellent. There was plenty of room of all 5 of us with 2 Double beds in the Bedroom and a double sofa bed in the Living room. It was great to have the kitchen so that you could make a cup of tea or even eat in as we did one night. The location was excellent with a shop on the corner that sold everything and a Starbucks just around the corner. Also Grand Central was just a stroll away so you were only a train ride from everywhere. If you wanted to walk around Time Square was only about 15 mins and you wouldnt even notice the walk because there was so much to see. I have stayed in Hotels in New York before and this was far superior. I would recommend Murray Hill to anyone.",
            "This hotel is within walking distance to many of the top attractions and relatively close to the subway. The rooms are clean and the staff is good but not great. For the price I could not think of a better place to stay in Manhattan. I would recommend it to anyone travelling to New York.",
            "We were at the hotel for most of a week in July. it was clean, quiet, and superbly located: we needed to get to the lower numbered streets as well as the usual museums (first-time visitors) The kitchenette was fine: the room information said that microwaves and toasters were available, but we didn't get around to asking. It doesn't count as luxury, but neither does my house, and we would stay there again any time.",
            "I have stayed at the Murray Hill East twice this past year and each time has been a very good experience. The staff is helpful and caring. The rooms are big and clean. Each room has a small kitchen. You never know what you may get as far as a room in NYC and I have never been disappointed in a room at the Murray Hill. Very safe and nice neighborhood. You can always get a cab on Third Ave. Only $25 per night to park your car at their garage. Walking distance to Times Sq, and Empire State building.",
            "For the past eight-years I\u2019ve stayed at least once or twice a year at the Murray Hill East Suites, and it feels like my home-away-from-home when doing business in Manhattan. The central location and friendly neighborhood can\u2019t be beat, the suites are unusually large for New York, and the kitchen and dining area make life easier when you get back late and want to eat what you want to eat, not just what\u2019s around the neighborhood. The hotel is very clean, the beds comfortable, the water pressure good, and the staff is efficient! OK, the d\u00e9cor is vintage and a bit frayed in some suites, but with Manhattan rates going in the $400 to $600 range per-night, this is a wonderful alternative for \u201creal\u201d people. If you\u2019re looking for posh elegance, or five-star amenities, and a snobby staff, then the Murray Hill is NOT for you. If you want homey, casual, clean, comfortable and roomy place to relax after a day of work, then this is the ticket. I\u2019ll be in NYC again next month, and got into the Murray Hill-- in my book one of the more conveniently located and top-ten places to stay in the city, you can walk to Broadway, great restaurants, and Grand Central!",
            "After staying at the Murray Hill Suites two years ago, we were prepared for a good experience, but from the beginning we were disappointed. We had requested a no-smoking room, but when we opened the door the smell of tobacco permeated the room. We had a suite for three people that had a king bed and a convertible sofa in the living room. When we opened the convertible at night and took the sheets and blanket from the closet, the blanket had a horrible stench to it. Since it was almost midnight, we called the front desk to complain, but since nobody else was on duty except for the front desk person, I had to put my clothes on again to go downstairs to get a replacement blanket. Then we discovered that the bedroom window kept opening if a strong wind blew. This occurred during the night with the NY temperature in the range of the high 30's and low 40's. We tried all kinds of methods to keep it closed, but with no success. We finally got a bellhop to come upstairs to fix it with some difficulty. Housekeeping, too, was disappointing, as one can guess from our experience with the blanket. The cleaning job each day was haphazard, and on the last night of our stay they didn't even make our bed. Very disappointing.",
            "We just spent 4 nights in Murray Hill East Hotel. Loved the location: close to lots of restaurants, transportation, shopping. Hotel is clean. Nice furnishings. Staff is friendly and helpful. On the downside: the bed was uncomfortable, the bathroom door would not stay closed, lots of street noise at night, wireless internet only in the lobby,",
            "I am a former NY'er who goes home for visits frequently for at least a week at time. I hate hotels so I look for apartments or apartment-like accommodations. I got this through a travel deal on Orbitz and I could not have been happier. Much better than the place I have been staying in previously, which I will not name but which I will never go back to again now that I have found the Murray Hill!! We had a one bedroom suite - huge, this place obviously used to be an apartment building and I sure wouldn't mind living in an apartment like this! I love the bathroom (it's bigger than the one in my home)and has nifty art deco lights. The bathroom was white and green and the green theme continued throughout the apartment. Dark green carpet and the bed linens were also in the green hue. If you are looking for shiny new modern, then this is not the place for you. BUT if you are looking for large, comfortable, CLEAN, convenient accommodations, you can't beat this place. The kitchen has a dishwasher, some very basic pots and pans (not new but clean and they did the job). No toaster or microwave. The coffee pot is small and since we were there for a week and my husband drinks a lot of coffee we bought a larger coffee pot and 2 large mugs. No big deal to us. We had brought our own coffee and coffee pot filters. We never had any reason to call the front desk for anything and checking in and out was a breeze. The doormen were all charming, the housekeeping staff pleasant. Since I'm from NYC, I was very familiar with the neighborhood (having worked in the area for many years)tons of stores, a short walk to Grand Central, All in all, I'm loving it! We WILL be back!! !",
            "It is about 8 minutes walk from the grand central station, very convenient. and there are lots of restaurants and convenient stores nearby. The room is comfortable , gived me a sense of living in my home. The view from my room is also nice.",
            "We waited 30 mins for the chamber maid to start/finish the room - she saw us waiting in the hall and still took her sweet time. The carpet had stains in it, the kitchen was clean, the beds had bed bugs, the windows weren't as well insulated as one would hope, the walls are thin. The bathroom was newly renovated but very small, you could barely turn around full circle. The front desk people weren't that friendly, no one made eye contact and generally didn't offer to help us - even if you were perusing a map for 10 minutes in front of them. They were just a bit too lazy or didn't care - just did their jobs to the minumum. It's not a bad place to stay, just a bit dark and run down. I'm sure it's a great deal for a family since they can cook lots of meals and feel at home. But if you're single or married - there are much more relaxing or exciting places in NYC to spend your time in.",
            "Stayed at the Murray Hill East April 6 - 9, 2007. The location is excellent at 3rd and 39th. We walked to Grand Central Station (only about 2 blocks away), Times Square, and much more. The room was a studio with two double beds, sofa (no pull out), table with 2 chairs, TV, and Desk. The kitchen was small, but offered everything we needed. There was no microwave oven however. The room was kept clean, although it could use updating. The carpet was pink (bad color for a hotel room) and had several stains. Housekeeping did a good job, even washing the dishes. We enjoyed the space as we have heard hotel rooms in NYC are very very small. We were on the 8th floor and could still hear street noise, but it is NYC after all. This hotel is not the 4 Seasons, but it is really a good value and a great location for your home in NYC.",
            "I have stayed at this apartment hotel in NYC for over 20 yrs about 5 wks per year. It is in a good neighborhood with all the conveniences....drycleaners, nail salons, shoe repairs, grocery, restaurants and delis. It is a little worn around the edges so they are finally beginning to rennovate. They have studios, 1 bedrooms and a couple 2 bedrooms. Spacious and good for families. Full kitchens and pretty clean though a little worn. You would walk by it on the street and believe it was just another apartment bldg. However the manager there is the WORST at confirming rates, taking care of problems and communicating in general. You can call 10 times and even though he knows we are valued clients he will not return calls, confirm reservations or rates. In all my years in business I have never seen a hotel behave like this. If I were you I would book over the internet and not go through him or the reservations there as I feel that is dicey. After recently being overcharged by $90 he is refusing to credit me or return my calls. That is just bad behavior and bad business. The ppl at the front desk are friendly but behind them is just bad behavior and management.",
            "We were there for three days with two teens. The size of the rooms were nice and the location to midtown was perfect. HOWEVER, the staff was ugly to say the least. Very unresponsive to needs/questions. The only TV in the suite was in the living area did not work well at all and was tiny. Very poor reception - not good when traveling with teens. The decor was very dated but clean. Good value to have a roof over your head while in the city, but don't expect any comforts of a vacation stay.",
            "We had a large two-bed room (6th floor facing north. nominally \"smoking\" but without any smell) with full kitchenette, two big closets and a big bathroom with all basic amenities, plus dressers and a desk, windows that opened, with an actual (if narrow) view, adjustable air-conditioning, and decent beds. The staff were helpful and the cleanliness was faultless. The hotel has old-fashioned thick walls and is on a quiet street (important for sleeping) despite its central location, with grocery and wine stores around the corner and plenty of cafes and bars and wifi nearby. The hotel has a laundry center and there's a dry cleaner across the street. The tradeoffs are no room service, no hotel cafe or bar, and no business center or online access, which might matter in winter. Also, the room decor is old-fashioned indifferent and the carpet a bit worn."

I arrived 3 hours before check-in to find out that my upgraded room was ready. (From a petite to a Queen Luxe.) Room size was fine, especially for nyc. The bathroom was a treat. Lots of mirrors, but not tacky. Only complaint was that the lighting could have been better for make-up application. Excellent bath amenities; Hermes shampoo & conditioner and CO Bigelow soaps and lotion. Shower was fabulous. Bed was very comfortable. iPod docking station/clock didn't work, but that was remedied within 5 minutes. Cd/Dvd library is a nice feature, but not a great selection and almost everything I wanted was out of stock; it seemed like they did not have duplicates. The best part of my stay was the service. I was greeted by every staff member I passed. I work in a hotel in guest services, so I'm very picky about this aspect of my stay. Everything I needed or asked for was taken care of promptly.

I do miss the Hermes bath products, but the home baked cookies every night make up for it! I call it my \"home away from home,\" and its location is perfect: next to the Harvard Club, blocks from Bergdorf's & Takashimaya, and steps from Broadway. Service at City Club is exceptional, and they have even accommodated me with meeting space on the second floor.

The Bigelow toiletries & abundance of towels are a great touch! They even bring you chocolate chip cookies with turn down service. Also, a nice feature for our teens was the free DVD rental from the front desk with many, many movies to chose from. The only downside I had was the noise from the street & other rooms, but we did have a great view with a balcony, so you have to take the good with the bad.

            "I found this hotel online at a bargain rate for a Friday night stay for a business meeting in NYC. I booked the least expensive room I could. Not knowing what to expect (although it had great reviews) I was pleased to see it was located in Times Square right next door to the famous Algonquin Hotel. GREAT location - between 5th Avenue and Times Square. When I walked in I was greeted by a super-friendly front desk, and told I had been upgraded to a King (I had booked a \"petite double.\"). The room was absolutely lovely! Nicely decorated, and the amenities! I loved an umbrella in the closet for guest use, the mini bar (which I didn't use but it was so nice!) with high end alcohol and Dean & DeLuca treats, and the turn down service - a china plate with two great big cookies left on the bed. In the morning, a canvas bag on the doorknob holding the NY Times. At turndown I also got a weather forecast for the next day. The bed was SO comfortable it was hard for me to want to leave for a morning meeting. I slept so well. It was also quiet. Not much of a view, but who cares? The bathroom (which I am told is the same size in all rooms) is large, and even has a chair. The bath amenities are top notch and they provided EVERYthing - and the shower was great. In the morning checkout was a breeze. Desk clerk called doorman for a cab, which was waiting when I got to the door. I hated to leave. One note - there was a charge on my credit card bill from the hotel and I called to inquire. I was told it was a mini-bar charge for two sodas. I told them I did not use the mini bar at all, and they promised a credit without discussion. No problem!",

The bathroom is my perfect bathroom. Staff were friendly and helpful. Our friend was upgraded to a super room so definitely worth spending a little more for a better room. The hotel is very conviently located and even though central, it isn't too close to Time Square so not full of tourist attractions.

After reporting the issue to front desk and then the General Manager - Lauren, they rectified the issue by moving me to a new room and apologizing for the inconvenience. Superb service!! !",
            "I stayed at the City Club for 2 nights while on a business trip. I initially picked it only because of the location (right across the street from where I needed to go), but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was for the price I was paying (~$180 a night with our corporate rate). ROOM: Decoration of the room is very modern. Have a super-comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and nice shower. The room itself is a little small - you open the door and the bed is pretty much right there; and you stepped out of the bed, you are pretty much in the bathroom. But even though it's petite, it contains all the essentials and comfort you need (unless you want a desk to do work on - in which case, there really isn't one). LOCATION: The location is very central. Being on 44th Street, it's only a few blocks from Times Square on one side, and a few blocks from Grand Central on the other. There are a few subway stops within walking distance MISCELLANEOUS: The reception has a booklet that you can pick out free DVDs from, but I was too tired from work to borrow anything, but it is a nice-to-have. Since there is a DVD player in the room, I guess you can bring your own DVDs to watch too. Every night I come back, there is a plate of two cookies awaiting me - I thought that was a nice gesture. And when I first arrived (I arrive really early) and they allowed me to check right in, so that was nice too. They don't have a gym, but I think you can pay for a pass to use the NY Sports Club nearby. Although I don't think they open very late.",
            "This hotel was absolutely terrible!!! We were there for a one night stay over Valentine's day. I had never been to NYC, so I was very excited for our stay. When we got to our queen luxe room I was extremely disappointed. My fianc\u00e9 opened the window shades and we had a huge brick wall for a view. Then we noticed that there wasn't even a TV in the room even though they say that there are \"premium channels in all guest rooms including HBO\" and they offer a DVD library to choose from. However, there was a DVD player in our closet (I don't know what we were supposed to watch it on). Anyway, the lack of TV didn't really matter that much to us since we were only there one night and weren't in the room much. It was very hard to sleep that night. You could hear every noise in the hall and other people's rooms and the cover to the heating unit kept falling off of the wall. Then to top off the experience I notice that my credit card had an extra charge of $30.00 on it. I called to the hotel and they told me it was for a bag of potato chips, a small bottle of spirits, and a half a bottle of red wine. I explained to Emanuel that we had never even touched the mini bar. I guess he thought that we ate chips and drank while watching a nonexistent TV and staring at the brick wall. So overall the experience was awful and they tried to rip us off too!! !",
            "Excellent location and exceptionally clean boutique hotel. Well appointed rooms were serene and peaceful, and included a lovely window sofa complete with plump pillows. Bathrooms were big with thoughful ammenities, plush terry robes and gigantic wall mirror. Warm cookies awaited our return in the evening. Very clever TV setup. Luxurious linen and comforter. By far, The Very Best Mattress and Pillows we have ever slept on anywhere! Where can we buy a set?! Incredible $$$ Value for Mid-town Manhattan. Staff was curteous and accomodating but not overtly helpful. Only two downsides...1. No in-room coffee. Had to order room service or get dressed and go out for the am coffee fix. 2. Could barely read the tiny, light print of Guest-Hotel info book. Both easily fixable. Would most definitely stay at this lovely gem of a luxe hotel in the middle of Manhattan again, and again, and again. Thanks for a wonderful experience. The pleasure was all ours.",
            "My stay in Manhattan could have been a much nicer one had i known about the construction going on here. I arrived late at night for a 2 night business trip. The construction started at 7 in the morning and continued until 7 at night. I don't know what I would have done had I been with my wife for a relaxing stay. As mine was for business, I had to get up early anyway. It still bothered me though that I wasn't informed about this inconvenience when I booked the room. The manager refunded some money back to me but it was too little too late. I would have preferred to stay elsewhere.",
            "First stay in NYC, had feared the worst in terms of service and value but pleasantly surprised by city club. Kindly upgraded from a petite room to a larger one. Turn down service is a nice touch, that few pricier hotels would even bother with. Only minor gripe, was that booking website advertised that access to NYC sports club was included in the rate, this was actually $15 extra. Not their fault, but something to beware of. Otherwise great service all round, will be returning next month.",
            "For my annual jaunt to New York, I always book boutique hotels since I want to stay away from the overly touristy crowds and noise that large hotel chains have. I went on Priceline.com and found it at a great price and decided that it would be decent since I had dinner at DB Bistro Moderne their attached restaurant and was impressed with their style and service. And upon my arrival, the hotel did not disappoint - it IS a small but stylish hotel and has all the things necessary for a stay. City Club also located within a short brisk 10 minute walk from the Port Authority which is perfect since it works for the majority of airport transportation services I use. I went Newark Airport Express this time. What I liked best: . Great service, the front desk staff member Danielle was knowledgeable and efficient. She direct us to two local restaurants (one for lunch and the other for brunch and both were great value and food) . Check out time is Noon and free wireless . Delicious cookies with turn down service . Hand delivered bills the evening before . Locally produced and distributed toiletries by CO Bigelow What to live with: . Dark hallways and little natural light in the room (I expected as much so wasn't surprised) . No frills lobby and amenities If you're looking for a small hotel with style and substance rather than fluff, this is the place to visit.",
            "Location - central. Reception - lots of attitude from most of the staff, like we are a BOUTIQUE hotel! Said and did the right things with our issues and concerns, but with just enough willingness to pass for acceptable. Room - well appointed. Dark colors and poor lighting - my wife had difficulty putting on her makeup. The bed was no good. We changed rooms on night 2, but this was no better. We ended up sleeping on the couch! Fitness Center - you have to pay $20 per day to utilize it ...not sure that the site disclosed this at booking time? I was not about to pay for the fitness club after it was listed as an amenity. Another let down!",
            "I have stayed at the City Club Hotel 4 times now across the past year and my experience every time has me looking forward to going back. I tend to stay at upscale hotels on my own dime (ritz / W / upscale boutique hotels) and when I travel for work, I am limited by expense restraints. Which is how I first ended up finding this place. Since it's not a 'known' chain, I wasn't sure what I was going to find. What I love best about this place: 1) The service - Kelsey at the front desk person has literally been there every time I arrive - which makes this place feel more B&B, less impersonal chain hotel. Pple that work here start with \"yes\", do what they can to accomodate, and overall really seem to love what they do 2) warm chocoloate chip cookies on your bed at night: I mean, every hotel should do this. Amazing. 3) decor - sleek, mod decor and unique touches (interesting books) make each room slightly different. If you are not from NY, you may say the rooms are small, which some are, but honestly, you aren't spending that much time in the room so it doesn't really matter that much. 4) DB Bistro Moderne downstairs - super good restaurant which is sister to well known super upsacale Daniel, also in NYC. the salmon tartare is to die for. I don't usually write reviews btw. I just really love this place. I am willing to give up starwood points for thsi place, which is saying a LOT.",
            "We had received many suggestions of where to stay that was walking distance to Times Square but I found City Club Hotel on many websites and the location and price was worth checking out. Am I ever glad I did! Every staff member was extremely helpful and pleasant. Our room was clean, spacious and comfortable. We had way too many towels which is unheard of in most hotels! Each evening the turn down service left fresh baked chocolate chip cookies which were sooo good we couldn't help but devour them! Our room had a small balcony which made for great people watching. And we had FREE, easy access to Internet service! Our room also had a filled book case, telephone in the bathroom, flat screen tv, plenty of full length mirrors and more! There's a parking garage right across the road. I can't say enough about how perfect this hotel was for us. I would recommend this hotel a hundred times over!! !",
            "Just returned from three nights at the City Club. I find it difficult to believe that this hotel is ranked #74 on tripadvisor.com out of over 300 hotels in Manhattan. I guess there are City Club moles on this site voting for their hotel. The bathroom was a good size with wall to wall brown marble. Hermes bath products are a cheap grade found in most Marriott Courtyards. The shower was large enough for a small orgy but was the same level as the bathroom floor so there was water spillage outside the shower and into the room. There are touches throughout the hotel to evoke a boutique and trendy feel, however most of it was done on the cheap. Overall, it feels like an old building with a dimestore makeover. Laminated cork floors show wear after only four years, chipped paint, pealing wallpaper, dim lighting to hide the flaws. Mattresses feel old but are covered with a nice featherbed and decent linens. Staff was good at providing restaurant and nightlife recommendations and went out of their way to do so. Midtown Location is good on W. 44th street between 5th and 6th Aves. I'm not an expert on NYC hotels but $350+/night for this hotel outside of New Years is not a good value when you have the Regency and SOHO Grand available for $30-$50 more per night.",
            "From the moment we stepped out of our car in front of the CIty Club Hotel, it was apparent that we were in for a once in a lifetime experience. Lucas and Socorro greeted us with a warm and friendly manner and made sure my wife and I were acclimated to our new surroundings. For 3 days we felt like we had their direct attention, not to mention the manager, Hugo Yanes, who was not only very professional but extrememly kind and helpful in every way. In short, we can say that we felt comfort beyond any other hotel we have ever stayed at. The building itself is impressive in decor and cleanliness, and the kindness of the staff made it really enjoyable and most relaxing. Thank you Hugo & the rest of the CIty Club staff!! We love you guys and will be back for the New Year!! !",
            "I've loved this hotel since it opened. Stayed here 3-4 times for a night or two. This time, came for almost a week and persuaded friends from L.A. who were also coming to NYC to stay at the City Club. The location can't be beat. The staff are friendly and always helpful. Housekeeping is excellent and thorough. But.....the bloom is off the rose. There was the elevator that didn't work one day and no one seemed to know why not; then the bathroom door that was off its track and no one could figure out how to get it back, so it required brute force to open and close; then the toilet that needs a new flapper valve so that it closes each time; and room service who decided \"you must have an old menu\" but wouldn't bring a current one upstairs (!). I still like this place. I like it a lot. But after the latest visit, I will check out other new places before automatically coming back here. The NYC hotel scene is highly competitive - at current rates, you've got to stay on top of your game! I hope the City Club management can kick it up a notch.",
            "We booked a petite room through expedia, which meant no room for suitcases or 2 people really. Would have been ok for one person though. Strangely enough the bathroom was MASSIVE - why not skip part of the bathroom to make room for a chair? Anyway, apart from size (and the window which looked out onto a wall) the room was lovely with a very comfortable bed. The cookies every night were very welcome especially when combined with a cup of something hot from the coffee shop over the road. Location is great for mid town and staff were always friendly. One night we ate in the restaurant on the ground floor - definitely not cheap but a lovely night out. If we found a good price on a bigger room we would definitely consider returning.",
            "I just got back from NYC and 3 nights at the City Club. I read the reviews on here before booking it, but made the res in spite of some decidedly negative reviews. I am glad I did because I absolutely enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again. The staff was very good overall--though some definitely more helpful than others. The cookies at turn down were great as was the location of the hotel. I was on a media tour and we were smack in the middle of everywhere we needed to be. My standard room was actually much larger than i was anticipating, as was the bathroom. The towels, bed and amenities were great. I love modern/contemporary design and felt the hotel was designed in great taste. My only minor complaints had to do with a fixed AC temp of 70 degrees, which was a little chilly for me, and a low-level of light. If you really wanted to get a lot of work or reading done in the room, you'd be stuck sitting on the bed or camped in the bathroom. Luckily that wasnt the case for me. Also the bathroom outlet was hard to find--I saw that another reviewer said there wasnt one--maybe they just couldnt find it (which isnt a good thing). One more note--i think some people are put off by the lack of a lobby. On the same block, there are many fancy hotels to have a drink and loiter in, and I actually enjoyed the fact that ours wasnt going to turn into party central. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and stay there again.",
            "One of the few places a family of five can stay. It was so clean & the room was large for NYC! The service was great! Everyone was friendly & so helpful! I would highly recommend staying here (I actually already have to some family:)>",
            "City Club is a great hotel in a great location. The fact that Daniel Boloud's DB bistro adjoins the hotel so that a guest may step in or order room service-either resulting in a fabulous meal is fantastic. The beds are extremely comfortable, the coset space is minimal but there are plenty of drawers and shelves. Valet and bell service is generally vey good. The front desk greetings range from austere to very friendly. I would definitely stay at this hotel agin, it is great as is 44th street in Midtown Only two complaints, the crony desk staff insisted on Monday morning January 31 that the hotel had not received a federal express delivery for me on Saturday January 29 saying the hotel would have immediately delivered the package to my room as the hotel has limited storage etc. As I had given up and was heading out the front door, the clerk ran towards me with my delivery in hand and advised that my fed ex had been stuffed away somewhere. Also, the bellman was focused on finding me a town car vs any car/a cab to the airport. I ran down to 6 th avenue to hail my own cac.",
            "We stayed at the City Club a week ago for one night. We wish we could have stayed longer! Although it was a short stay the hotel exceeded our expectations. We arrived early and the manager (Hugo) suggested a perfect spot down the street for lunch. We were pleasantly surprised when went back to check in as we were upgraded to a suite. It was beautiful, with a two story window looking out onto 44th street, a small balcony, and a spiral staircase up to a loft/bedroom and bath. We were meeting a friend for drinks and Hugo suggested a great nearby lounge. The room was incredibly comfortable and quiet and we'll definitely be back!",
            "This is a wonderful, fantastic place to stay in NYC! It is so friendly, yet professional and the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy. The room was fabulous, super comfortable, luxurious and well, just perfect. It's small and intimate and beats the choices in the 50's & Broadway by a mile. All the grace, luxury and class of the chain luxury hotels, with none of the pretense. The location is perfect. Just steps away from the theatres and several amazing bistro/restaurants that feel like neighborhood places, just outside the door. Now I won't stay anywhere else when in the city.",
            "I stayed at this hotel not too long ago and was not happy with my service. I arrived and was and checked in by a young woman by the name of Jenna (I believe), who confidently assigned me a room and assured a pleasant stay. I as I entered my room I noticed it was already occupied by another guest who was half decent and clearly startled and upset. Embarrassing for the both of us. So I returned to the front desk to a less than sympathetic Jenna who down played the situation and quickly assigned me another room. I was put in a smaller room than the one I originally walked in and it had way too much outside noise. Not the best trip.",
            "I was going for an overnight trip to New York and knew that I would not be spending much time in my room. So, I was looking for a nice, stylish hotel in a good location at a good price. I managed to snag a $200 rate from Quikbook for a \"petite\" room and it was perfect for my needs. The room was small - not much bigger than the double bed - but I expected that. It was beautifully appointed and stylishly decorated. TV, DVD player, mini-bar tucked away. The marble-clad bathroom was very nice with plenty of towels and Hermes products. There were even a couple of fresh chocolate chip cookies at the end of the day. And the NY Times at my door in the morning. The room might be tight for 2 people and it would be too small if I was staying for a few days. But there are larger rooms that are very nice - I looked in one as I went down the hallway. My only complaint is that the tile in the hallway echoes any footsteps that go by your door. It's not a big deal, but carpeting would deaden the noise. The reception and doormen were friendly and helpful. The lobby is small and connects to the well-rated DB Moderne restaurant, where meals can be taken. I'm a pretty tough critic of hotels, but I would stay at the City Club again.",
            "Following our cruise we opted to stay on New York for our 3rd time. We last stayed at the city club in march 2010 and thought it was a great value for money hotel, like a hidden gem! The staff were very helpful indeed with any matter and always had time for a brief chat. Location is superb, you come out of the hotel and turn left straight on to 5th avenue or go right and to Times square, oh and a few doors away the red flame diner! If we return to new york it would be the city club every time......",
            "Spent two nights in this hotel over a weekend and loved it. It's a terrific little boutique hotel in a very convenient midtown location. Close to the the theatre district, Grand Central Station, Bryant Park, Central Park and a good jumping off point to go anywhere in the city. The rooms were nicely decorated in neutrals, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was luxurious - quite large by NY standards. Great shower with good water pressure, dark marble and a white pedestal sink. The only down side to the bathroom was the light above the sink wasn't bright enough for putting on make up. Even my husband said it was a bit dark for shaving too. Otherwise the towels were thick and although we didn't use them, there were two nice robes hanging up in the bathroom. The closet is concealed in one of the walls in the bedroom and unfortunately in our room the only place to mount the flat-screen TV was over the full length mirror in the bedroom. That made the mirror un-useable unless you wanted to sit on the floor. There was a nice built in couch/window seat which was a great place to lay out your clothes, etc. since there was no bureau. Floors are not carpeted but there were some area rugs next to the bed. The room was quiet although we did hear other guests come in one night at 4am. Their door was right next to ours, so you can't blame the hotel for that - more like inconsiderate guests at that hour. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful when asked for directions or recommendations on places to eat. Although we didn't have a chance to eat at DB Bistro Moderne the restaurant on the street level of the hotel, it had come highly recommended by a friend of ours. We loved the City Club Hotel and would definitely return the next time we're in NYC.",
            "This little jewel is in the perfect spot to enjoy all that midtown Manhattan has to offer. Two blocks to Times Square, two blocks to Grand Central, and two blocks to Bryant Park. They have a few suites that are very nice for that special weekend, but for the quietest stay ask for an inside room. Continental breakfast is served in their \"Hot Spot\" late night bar or directly to your room. I have staying here for 5 years, and miss it dearly when it get's booked. So book early.",
            "Clean, tastefully decorated and best of all, very quiet hotel 1 or 2 blocks from all the theaters. The rooms are kind of small (they do look just like the internet pictures, just smaller in real life). We didn't feel cramped, though. It seemed kind of pricey at first, but I did some more research and its right in line with the other hotels in midtown, including the \"chain\" hotels\" and City Club is much better than those. We stayed in a Queen luxe (3 days) and it was the best nights sleep we've had away from home in years. We did not try the DB restaurant next door (very busy, though, so it must be pretty popular), but we did patronize the Red Flame Diner two doors down. \"Regular diner prices\" (meaning CHEAP) right in Mid-town! It was great! Gregory's coffee shop across the street has the freshest muffins in town...melt in your mouth! We would definitely stay here again. Use one of the internet travel sites (orbitz, etc) to book instead of City Club website and save 20% or so.",
            "You arrive at a small desk to check in, there is no public area and no hotel atmosphere but the staff is nice and involved. The room was extremely small even for NY, not mint, dated with a view to a wall. You can hear the noise from the corridor only covered by the noise from the street in the morning. There is no reading light. The TV set can only be seen standing! Room service from the DB restaurent is efficient and excellent. The breakfast, its brioche and the whole menu is to die for. Nicely located on 44th street, but prefere the Sofitel next door, better value, better rooms, better atmosphere you can go to DB for breakfast next door.",
            "City Club is a small boutique hotel in a great central location in midtown Manhattan. Staff was very helpful and accommodating. Rooms are a little on the small side with no view (not surprising in Manhattan). The fabric wallpaper is showing a lilttle wear and tear, but the room was clean. Bathroom was great with good quality soap and shampoo; water pressure in the shower that would blow you down the block! Hotel was quiet and rooms have black-out shades for great sleeping. Turn down service came with killer chocolate chip cookies. Staff recommended the restaurant next door, DB Bistro Moderne, for lunch - which was terrific. There is a large fitness club a few doors down to which guests have complimentary access. Only real complaint about the hotel was that despite the property being a non-smoking hotel, our room reeked of smoke. Suspect that because of fabric wallpaper, the smell is difficult to get out, but it was off-putting. Room rate was competitive with other hotels of it's class. Did get a much better rate off Expedia than I was offered when I called the hotel directly. Overall, would definitely stay there again.",
            "I'm still laughing about the comment below regarding lack of TV in the room. The TV is behind a glass wall - when it's off, it's as if it weren't there. Anyhow, I have stayed numerous times in this hotel since it first opened, and if you're a theatre-goer, this is one of the most amazing locations. The Red Flame diner a few doors down is a gem, plus DB Moderne is one of the best restaurants in NYC. I love staying at this hotel.",
            "The City Club hotel offers an eclectic style for such an old City. All the buildings have a history about them. Not that the City Club doesn't. They have taken an old holel and given it a different feel. We loved the staff they were GREAT!. I spran my ankle while visiting and they were quick to respond with ice. Our room safe needed a new battery and they quickly fixed that as well. The beds and linens are also top of the line. I have never slept that well out of town. Great location - very close to Times Square, shopping and Theaters. I enjoy smaller hotels as they seem more personable and City Club fits that model. With only 65 rooms it is fairly quiet for the city and not difficult to find your way around. Here the drawback. The rooms are small. We did have a balcony witha decent view which made up for the size. I realize it is NY and a lot of the rooms are small in size. If you are staying for an extended period and have a lot of clothes you will be hard pressed to find someplace to put them. Closet space is shared with your refrigerator and you have a small night stand with 3 small drawers. If I was to make a recommendatation to the hotel, if they could just find some way to create a bit more storage for your belongings they would be top notch.",
            "Stayed here with my wife and it was fantastic. It's so well located! We had a room on the top floor with a small balcony. Not much of a view but it was great place for a coffee in the AM before heading out and a glass of wine in the evening before dinner.",
            "I've stayed at City Club Hotel before, and the location is excellent. Staff is professional and efficient. However, I stayed in a room this time that was dark, small and had an antique, loud air conditioner unit. The free WIFI is clunky and difficult to use. Cell phones don't function well in many of the rooms. I saw a large roach in my room, and when I told the front desk, I found the response fairly non-reactive. Showers have good pressure and heat. Hotel is starting to feel quite dated.",
            "This is a boutique hotel just a stone's throw from Time's Square. It is on a lovely, somewhat quiet street next to some beautiful historic properties..The Algonquin, The Iroqouis are next door. There is a large Brooks Brothers store a few doors down. If you are looking for an inexpensive place to drop after a night of Time's square or taking in some theater, this could be for you. We got it for 175 a night on Hotwire...the other hotels I mentioned start their room rates at 399 a night. Sofitel is also on the street (600 a night) So..this place is a \"bargain\" That said..there were some real problems with our room. It was so dark..the lighting in there made it impossible to shave or do make-up...I had to go into the hallway. The bedroom was SOOO tiny that I tripped on the baseboards every time I went to the bathroom. The bathroom is lovely (almost the same size as the bedroom) but again...poor lighting made it impossible to do anything in there. There were some \"bells and whistles\" which were nice...Frette linen and an ipod docking station. It was VERY clean. Wonderful cookies on our pillow at bedtime. But I don't know if I would stay again. Maybe I would...and just upgrade (another 150) to a bigger room.",
            "I recently stayed at the City Club in NYC. We stayed in one of the 2 story suites and it was absolutely amazing. The amount of space was unlike any other in NYC. The location of the hotel was great. The staff was extremely professional and helpful. They made our stay extra special.",
            "My husband and I stayed at the City Club in NYC for three nights, and were so excited (before we checked in) about staying at this trendy boutique hotel. However, don't be fooled by their lovely website. The service on check-in was...disappointing to say the least. If you're expecting a warm friendly welcome, keep looking, the staff are quite simply put...rude. When we finally got to our room, its like we stumbled into a broom closet with a double bed, not exactly the romantic atmosphere we imagined. The bathroom was ok, fairly clean, but no tub. There are only two good things about this hotel, it's location relative to Times Square and the Theatre District and the warm chocolate chip cookies you get with turndown service. Overpriced is an understatement for this hotel and star rating is defintely inflated!",
            "I travel frequently to NYC for work, and the City Club Hotel is by far the number one place I choose to stay as it has become a home away from home for me. The staff is friendly, competent, and helpful - and I truly enjoy the hospitality. I have never stayed in a room there that I disliked as the rooms are more spacious, comfortable, modern, and clean than many other boutique hotels that I have stayed in (not to mention, the bathrooms are always amazing). The complimentary chocolate chip cookies are also always a plus! Overall, I have nothing bad that I can think of other than when they are booked up and I have to stay elsewhere. I would recommend this hotel to all of my family and friends and would feel very comfortable with my recommendation and their expected satisfaction.",
            "It's taken me a year and a bit to put this review up. I travelled to NY in September 2009 (Note - Tripadvisor option won't allow me to backdate this far back so I chose Sept 2010 as the date of my stay instead) and stayed at the City Club Hotel after staying elsewhere in NY. It is a small hotel comparably. Service was great - very friendly and professional. There's free internet which is always great. The room that I got was called the Petite room (the smallest and cheapest room available) which is really suited for 1 individual even though there is a double bed, as the room itself is oddly enough, 'petite'. The bathroom is beautiful and clean as is the rest of the room. The bathroom was quite spacious. Location of hotel is central (44th street west off 5th Avenue) and situated in the more up market area - also very close to Times Square, Rockefellar Centre and only a short walk to Empire State Building, and is tucked away so that noise levels are reduced. In fact, couldn't hear what was going outside as opposed to the hotels situated in Times Square or on 7th Avenue (v.busy street). Paid AUD $416 for this room - over priced in terms of the space you get, yet I would stay here again because it is such a beautiful clean, central and friendly hotel (its boutique and independent - no big hotel chains here). I enjoyed my stay in this hotel.",
            "tight quarters sure but the style and service of the place was excellent! down feather beds, pillow and comforters, oh my! the biggest flat screen TV ever and the staff's attentiveness was superior: when I set the AC temp too low and froze the coils, within moments they sent up a megawatt air purifier/fan. I really liked how the staff was attentive but not overbearing, they were just great! and I loved the little \"party closet\" that's stocked with everything a gal would need!",
            "We stayed at the City Club because other reviewers said there were NO bedbugs which was our top priority. Their website was misleading because it made the hotel look better than it actually was. It was clean but small and confining with a draft from the window. It was not worth the price.",
            "I enjoyed my stay at the City Club. It's a small, intimate place with a lot of personality. Feels like a private club. The location is very central, close to Bryant Park, Grand Central and Times Square. The City Club is right next to the Algonquin, the Iroquois, the Sofitel and the Royalton. There is no ostentatious sign outside so it's easy to miss it. The lobby is very small and more like the entrance of an upscale residence. My room was on the 4th floor and the size was decent. It was very clean and perfectly decorated, with a very upscale, masculine feel. The bathroom was very classy both in size, design (black marble) and for the top quality amenities (Hermes and Bigelow). I especially loved the shower. The hotel was quiet with a limited number of rooms and guests. All in all, I can't complain about anything. The price - though relatively high - was quite acceptable by New York standards. Business hotel chains may offer large rooms, but they can hardly match the classy, intimate atmosphere of the City Club. Would definitely return to the City Club.",
            "I booked this hotel as a surprise trip to New York for my boyfriend's 40th birthday. I chose it because of the location and because he's into technology and it looked right up his street, plus the beds looked huge and sumptuous. A nice touch having the tv hidden behind the mirror and a CD player to create some abience. The only downside was the view... there wasn't one. But seeing as we didn't spend too much time in there anyway, we weren't complaining. Great spot to get around Manhatten as it's literally around the corner from Times Square. There's also a great little diner a few doors down which the staff recommended. Can't remember the name but we ate breakfast there each morning - delicious! We had one minor issue whilst staying there, and this was the 24 hour room service. We tried to order food at 2:00 and there were no staff to fulfill it so we went to bed hungry. Plus the juice in the mini fridge was well past it's sell by date. However, when I told them they went out and bought us back a big carton of Tropicana, so we were happy with that.",
            "Problems started early with our booking at the City Club. My wife tried to book online for our stay for two nights in a Queen Luxe. She called to book the rate available from the website, but was told that the rate is only available for booking via the Internet otherwise its was a hundred dollars more in total. At her request, I visited the website to make a reservation. However to my surprise, the website was not secured (read encrypted) so that my credit card number was going over the open internet. I called the hotel again and they told me that they didn't have encryption on their website (see the padlock in the bottom of the browser window). I asked the reservationist to take my booking over the telephone, but she refused to give me the lower rate.",
            "You can't judge Manhattan hotels against those anywhere else in the known universe: Prices are absurb, given the so-so quality of rooms in general. Judged against other mid-town, theater-district hotels, the City Club Hotel is a good, functional choice. Positives: The excellent location on 44th Street's \"club row\" right between the venerable Algonquin and Iroquois Hotels; a wonderfully helpful front-desk staff; reasonably spacious rooms (by New York bed-in-a-closet standards); good bedding; excellent, flexible lighting; two glorious chocolate-swirl cookies with the turn-down service (one of the very few times I've been impressed by such \"freebie\" snacks); thorough cleanliness; and no sign of bedbugs (a serious problem in Manhattan today). The negatives: Rooms need refreshing (getting just a bit tatty here and there); gloomy, horror-movie-dark hallways; and, despite trading on the location in the former City Club, there's no trace of the old club atmosphere or interior architecture. The rack-rate can stun out-of-towners, but it's the best deal on this still-distinguished block. Bottom line: I would stay here again--not least, thanks to the great front-desk staff.",
            "This was an exceptional place to stay from when we first disembarked our cab upon arrival till they held the door open for us to depart. The service by every member of the staff was so fantastic that in our short stay we ended up on a first name basis with a number of them. Any request was met with politeness and efficiency. Room was a decent size for NYC (esp for the price) and the location could not have been more ideal in terms of its proximity to the subway and numerous sites of interest. Loved that the TV was tucked away and the bed and day sitting area was super comfortable. The bathroom was stocked with fine toiletries and everything was very clean and well appointed. My husband and I had breakfast in the restaurant downstairs and everything was very tasty. Room felt very quiet for the city as it is on a 2 lane street -- some traffic noise but nothing that was prevented a pleasant stay. Would definitely stay here again not only because the room was comfortable and nice but mostly because the service was so outstanding.",
            "lovely little boutique hotel, choc chip cookies at bedtime to die for! great location right in the middle of everything just two blocks up from times square, little bistro across the street serve the best steaks and apple martinis. staff very friendly and helpful rooms small but immaculate we were given free upgrade, stayed 4 nights wished had of stayed longer",
            "If price is not on your mind, this hotel is spectacular! Lots of hotels spend thousands on a snazzy lobby but shabby rooms, but City Club Hotel did something out of the ordinary. It's a very simple and small lobby to check-in, just adjacent to an excellent restaurant, but the rooms are elegant and dramatic! Ipod alarm clocks, marble bathrooms, Hermes bath amenities, extremely comfortable beds and a free business computer on the 2nd floor made my stay very enjoyable! The lobby is light and airy; in contrast, the rooms are quite dark and masculine, but still comfy. I would not recommend to stay here on business, just because they focused on mood lighting, and not desk work stations. If you want your own quiet corner of NYC just steps away from Times Sq, you need to stay here. The staff were accomodating and helpful.",
            "I stayed in one of the hotels beautiful suites over the holidays with a few friends. We had a wonderful stay and made memories for a lifetime. We LOVED the cookies! The beds were so comfy, it was like sleeping on a cloud. A plus of the room was the ipod doc and terrace. It also had 2 bathrooms which came in handy! I definitely would recommend the hotel!",
            "I'm very positive about this hotel mainly because I got a very good deal from Expedia, and then an upgrade when I checked in. So for about $200, I got a spacious (by NYC standards) room in a cool hotel that's perfectly located for sightseeing. You can't beat that! The hotel's location on West 44th St. is great -- near all the action in Times Square but not as hectic. The staff at the front desk looked like they hadn't yet graduated from college but were among the most efficient and professional I've encountered. DB Moderne, one of NY's best mid-priced restaurants, can be reached through the hotel lobby, and you can even put your restaurant tab on your hotel bill (although the two businesses are separate), One amusing thing about the room decor is that it tries to camouflage things. If the front desk neglect to tell you that the TV is behind the painting (or wherever), you'd never find it. I thought at first there was no closet, then realized it had been cleverly hidden with the wallpaper. There were a few things I didn't care for. My room on the second floor faced the street and wasn't soundproof. The shower curtain didn't keep the water from splashing all over the floor. But those are the only negatives I can think of. If you can snag a deal on this hotel, by all means, stay here!",
            "My fiance and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the City Club Hotel. This is a unique alternative to the more mainstream name-brand hotels out there. Very quaint, modern decor, although some rooms were a bit small, it really provides all that is needed. If you are looking for a quiet, comfortable place to lay your head at night, this is a great place. The bed was very comfortable. The 2nd floor provides a comfortable, quiet space to spread out...with internet access. The location is one of the best. Just a block or two from 5th Avenue and high end shopping, with a short cab ride to the south into Greenwich Village area. It really is a very central location, and is removed from the craziness of Times Square. It's actually a very quiet street. The staff were very friendly and accomadating and provided information on what to do and where to go. It's small enough that they actually recognize you after a day and greet you with a warm smile upon entering to retire for the night. That was really nice, something you don't get with a larger hotel group. Continental breakfast was provided every morning, which was also very sufficient. Would definitely return here again in the future.",
            "After hours and hours of searching for a nice, quiet hotel during the holiday season in NYC, we found the gem in City Club Hotel. The rooms were perfect, the bathrooms so up-to-date and hip, and the staff was among the best we've encountered. The assistant g.m. is so attentive and generous with her time, the front desk people are delightful, and the doormen can make your day. The smallest things can make a trip worthwhile. They found out that I was a coffee \"addict\" and made sure I had a new coffeemaker in my room with supplies. The restaurant attached to the hotel is beautiful, although we only ate there once during our five days. Order the bagel and lox from the 24hr menu late one night! P.S. Wonderful beds and linens.",
            "My girlfriends and I stayed at City Club Hotel for a 40th birthday get together, and it was a wonderful experience. When we arrived there had been a mistake in my reservation (I had cancelled the first day by phone, but made the original reservation online). They coudln't find me in the system, but the person at the front desk (Lauren) kept trying different things, and eventually she found it. Unfortuately our Double Double room had already be taken by someone else, so Lauren immediately upgraded us to the 2-floor suite. We didnt' have to ask or push for anything, she just kept working until she found a good solution for us. The rooms were wonderful and quite \"homey\" in an urban way. It felt like we had moved to NYC for a few days. We are planning on staying there again when we go back this summer.",
            "If a view is not important to you, but a clean, well located and stylish room is, then this is the spot for you. This small boutique hotel is sandwiched between the Algonquin and a Sofitel. The Royalton is right across the street. I guarantee you that your room rate will be at least $200.00 less than those hotels. No, there is no lobby to speak of; we found ourselves settling in at the Algonquin for late night cocktails which worked out perfectly. The very expensive restaurant connected to the City Club is, I'm certain worth every penny however if you're watching your budget there is a diner not more than 20 paces from the hotel. The staff is young and friendly. We reserved a \"petite\" room and were upgraded to a much larger room with two double beds. Our room also had a window overlooking 44th street which was great for light but the city noise was definitely there. The room itself was sparkling clean: Frette sheets/duvets and robes. There are snacks from Dean and Deluca in the closet--the mini bar- along with a small fridge. Room service is available from Daniel Boulud's restaurant downstairs. Thoughtful touches: A Zagat guide to the city, loaner umbrella and chocolate chip cookies at turndown. I am almost fearful to write this review because this spot is such a terrific find. Look for discounted room rates --they are out there. Enjoy.",
            "The hotel was beautiful. Very modern and tasteful. The staff was unbelievably accommodating and helpful, especially the manager. They went out of their way to make sure our stay was the best it possibly could be. Very prompt service. The room was gorgeous and very comfortable. It's only a minute's walk from Times Square, the perfect location. It was absolutely a hidden gem in the heart of NYC. I would recommend this to anyone traveling to NYC for any reason.",
            "44th Street, Manhattan-I like this locale and so I have stayed up and down it, in between 6th and 5th. A few weeks ago I tried out City Club, located next door to The Algonquin across from The Royalton. I really enjoyed my visit there, very nice folks at the Front Desk greeted me and although they have no lobby to speak of there is a very nice bistro located 20 feet away. My room was very comfortable- well appointed and the bathroom was very hip and pleasing ( unlike The Hudson on 58th Street, where you would swear you were in the toilet of an Amtrak train ) It is a boutique hotel which I like if you want hustle and bustle it's waiting for you out the lobby door. Reasonably priced for a New York spot and I look forward to returning.",
            "Plusses: - excellent location - walk to everything in Midtown - in the same block as the Algonquin Hotel, the Iriquois, the Harvard Club, and the New York Yacht Club - near Times Square if that's what you want - easy to walk to Rockefeller Center - friendly staff calls you by name all the time - superb beds - 2 so-so cookies on your pillow at night - you can open your window if you get a room overlooking 44th street -- to listen to all the Times Square noise - yes, they are wireless -- and they have ONE public computer on the second floor Negatives: - typically they run late when you want to check in. You may have to wait an hour or so on the second floor. - very noisey - jack hammers start nearby at 7am & go all day - clothes closet for bedroom is 2 feet by 2 feet, very small - no coffee maker in room but there's a \"diner like\" restuarant in the same block, and a McDonalds two blocks away - no ventilation fan in the bathroom. Mirrors steam up. - lighting is tricky. You have to find the dimmer switch. The reading light(s) over the beds are useless. - TV speakers blare in the bedroom AND the bathroom. - Bathroom is a black marble, very masculine. Again, a GREAT LOCATION, within walking distance to everything in Midtown, but otherwise very mediocre.",
            "In all fairness, the City Club Hotel was, at one time, my favorite place to stay in the city. I was a frequent guest from the time it first opened in 2001 until a year ago. I recently returned for a 3 night business stay and booked a King Deluxe room online using the hotel's website. What a huge disappointment it was compared with my past experiences. Before this one I always enjoyed my stays largely due to the staff and their attention to service. From the onset, the Front Desk staff was aloof and indifferent. When the room type I had reserved was not available, I was put into a smaller room type without warning or explanation. The attitude and overall demeanor of the European woman who checked me in was just plain lousy. Her English was ridiculous and she spoke much too fast which made it even more difficult to understand. Generally, she acted as though she just wanted to get rid of me and did not try to hide it. Shame on her and on the City Club Hotel. The beds are still very comfortable but the rooms showed major signs of wear and tear. Frayed carpeting, overly worn towels, stained and threadbare robes, obsolete entertainment system, scuff marks on walls and doors, loose tiles on walls of bathroom. For the very high prices that the City Club Hotel is charging I could have stayed in a more trendy hotel in a neighborhood that doesn't close down as early as that one does. At least now my colleagues and I know not to return, we shall try one of the newer, better located hotels which charge the same rates.",
            "I've stayed in a lot of midtown hotels very close to the City Club, such as Morgan's, the Royalton, the Algonquin and the Millennium. From now on , this is going to be my first choice. The rooms are light and airy, the beds superb, the staff extremely helpful and the rates very reasonable for NY. Excellent.",
            "Stayed 6 nights in the City Club - great location on 48th street between 5th and 6th Ave - perfect spot to get to the best in Manhattan - the King deluxe rooms were lovely - very clean and staff very helpful. Would return to them when in New York again. Rates were reasonable too for the height of the summer. Overall an excellent stay.",
            "Because it is a small hotel it does not need much of a lobby or front desk, so that was OK with me. My room was an upgrade and very good size with a window bench seat and chair for my visitors. The bath was small but fine for me. I do not need a tub, and the shower was big. The floor tile was cheesy, but I was not interested in style awards. The TV was hidden behind the wall mirror and so had distracting glare. Bad decorator idea. Even though we were so close to 5th Ave shopping and Time Square chaos, it was quiet enough to get a good night sleep.",
            "we forgot our wallet back home in toronto but had plenty of cash and no credit cards on us. When we arrived to the hotel the manager at the front desk told us that we need a credit card and that he could not bend the rules for us. After pleading with him for ten minutes he said he will see what he can do and went to the back to make a call. When he left the other girl working at the front desk said that this happens all the time and she does not think that it will be a problem. Shortly after the manager comes out and says that he could not do anything for us. By than it was getting very late and we were very tired. to make a long story short our family back home had to come to our rescue and the staff were not accomodating at all. I would never stay there again and deff not recommend it to anyone",
            "If you're looking for a stylish small hotel, and are more of an Armani than Versace person, then look no further. My husband and I have had the good fortune to stay in some amazing hotels around the world - from country houses, to trendy boutiques, to spot on large hotels like The Mandarin Oriental and The Four Seasons. The style of City Club is low key and I say this as a compliment. Its a small, unassuming hotel, offering excellent service and a perfect place to rest your head in chic comfort. Location wise its on a fairly quiet street perfect for Midtown, 5th Avenue, Central Park and Times Square - for venturing further we never had more than a minute wait in hailing a cab. What makes the service stand apart from many other trendy hotels is that it did feel personal ....... returning after a long, hot day (and many a late evening!) of exploring this ever changing city, it felt unusual and uplifting to be recognised and acknowledged as guests of the hotel and for our day to be enquired of by the staff. The guys at City Club are just spot on ....happy for a start, welcoming, courteous, and extremely willing to offer suggestions and recommendations. The only downside of writing this review is that it means our holiday is now over and i'm back in Ol' Blightly .... I could have quite easily of taken up residence.",
            "I travel to NY frequently for business. I saw City Club at a good rate online so I booked it as I needed a hotel that was centrally located and had a restaurant onsite for meetings. I was really pleased witht the service. My room was very comfortable- it had a queen sized bed, great bath amenities, fast wireless internet access. The restaurant was very good. The beds were really comfortable and the fresh cookies that greeted me when i got back to my room at night could not be beat. The service was very good- the staff always greeted me when i came in and out and the bellstaff was always there to open the door for me. Will stay here again and have recommended it to my colleagues.",
            "When booking this hotel through a booking agent,we expected two beds in our room. The exceptionally small room contained one double bed,no chairs,no table ... very small... Those were the negatives. The bed was so very comfortable,the room very clean and the shower was amazing ... especially appreciated after a long day of sightseeing and theater-going in NY! The staff was friendly and,clearly do their best to accommodate their customers. The location is perfect and the hotel is so very quiet! We would stay there again!",
            "The staff(Michelle, Sandra, Doorman/engineer, and housekeeping) treated me like I was a regular even though it was my first time here. Very warm welcome and liked the style(small and easy on the eye) even before they upgraded me to a king size room which had a five star quality >> self control thermostat, high end stuff, and quiet. There was even a comfortable chair in the bathroom. There is a very upscale restaurant attached to the hotel that will make bacon and eggs or pancakes look like something from prehistoric times(hello toasted brioche), but there is also the very good and cheap Red Flame a few doors up. The location is great for the theater catching a subway up or down town east side or west side. Again, with people like Michelle to check you in and answer questions it is impossible to be unhappy here.",
            "We stayed at the City Club for 5 nights while on holiday in NY. We complained about the noise in our standard room and they upgraded us for no extra fee to a bigger, quieter room with no problem and very accommodating staff. The bathrooms are beautiful decked out in black marble with HUGE showers and lovely toiletries. The beds were extremely comfortable and the lighting was lovely. The location was fantastic, just a block away from 5th Avenue and Times Square. Amazing free warm cookies brought to us every evening!! Would definitely recommend and would stay again.",
            "I visit NYC often (about once a month) to see theater and to shop and I have a set group of hotels I usually stay in....I found this little \"gem\" by accident because I only needed a room for a night and only for one person so I reserved a petite room that was very affordable for the stay. I have to say that it was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had in any city in any country. I was treated like a queen by the staff and Hugo and Lauren were absolutely hotel class and professionalism at its best. It is a bit small, but the quality is HUGE! I highly recommend this hotel.",
            "Recently stayed at the City Club for four nights. Wonderful stay! We were upgraded to a King and found the rooms to be very clean and comfortable. Loved the dark colors, the privacy, the cookies on our pillows every night! The staff were curteous. Location in midtown perfect for theatre, proximity to Times Square, and easy access to the subway to other parts of town. Would absolutely stay here again anytime!",
            "I stayed at City Club in August with some colleagues for a two day meeting. Honestly, I travel alot for work. I'm in hotels more than I am at home. So natrually, I'm not easily impressed. I have to admit I was very impressed with City Club. The staff was great- helpful, upbeat, nice and honest about where to go. The room was a nice size- I was in the front (not where I usually like to stay because of noise). The room was bright and the bed was really comfortable. It wasn't noisy as expected... Great shower.. Housekeeping did a great job, and turndown was a treat- freshly baked chocolate chip cookies! I got free passes to the gym which isn't in the hotel but on the same block. The internet was fast. the location was good, but I prefer to be further downtown. Room service was prompt. Will stay again if my meetings bring me to midtown.",
            "This hotel is advertised above 4 stars, but it is 3-stars at best in my opinion. Our room needed remodeling. The wallpaper was old and worn. The rugs were stained. There was no real desk to work from in the room, just a small table. The tile shower was nice and the toilet had plenty of flush power. The bed was firm and comfortable. The hallways ARE dark as others have pointed out. The lobby is very small. The location is terrific two blocks from Times Square and about 5 blocks from Rockefeller Center. The staff is friendly and helpful. They bring you warm cookies each night which is nice. But 4 stars? No way. I was expecting better for the money and the star rating. You are really paying for location with this one.",
            "We stayed for 4 nights with our 3 girls (aged 20/16/16). We were made to feel so welcome, the staff were fantastic and could not have been more helpful. Brilliant location, right in the heart of the city. The room we had was just perfect and was so clean, spacious and had every amenity you could wish for. We were upgraded at no extra cost which made our stay all the more special. Would recommend this hotel to all our friends and a colleague at work has already provisionally booked having heard how great our stay was.",
            "This is a 3 star service and sized hotel trying to maintain a 4 star image - it just doesn't hang together. The Frontdesk check-in staff were amazing - but then it slowing but consistantly fell apart from there. There were issues with the plumbing in the room as confirmed by the engineer the first night - but apparently the day manager new more about hot and cold water than I. I was to stay 4 nights - but left after 2 (would have stayed only 1 but was too tired to move on the late evening of the 2nd day) Day Manager (who also seemed to double as the doorman) was rude - and ultimately why I left the hotel. Capitalism is great - and judging by the recent reviews I would say City Club now has a real problem on their hands. I have stayed at Jeff Klein's (the owner) hotel in West Hollywood, the Sunset Tower - it's amazing - but skip City Club, it just not worth it.",
            "Second time ive stayed at this property and it just gets better everytime. The staff are the most helpful and gracious i have ever ecountered in NY. The rooms are spacious and extremeley clean. Beds are out of this world. Great location to everything will always make this my home when in Mahattan Keep it up City Club",
            "I really likied this hotel and would consider staying there again. However, although the staff is very cordial and efficient, they are not very sophisticated and could use to stay on top of the latest happenings in NYC. Also, my room did not have any bathroom outlets, or a desk and chair, something that is standard at any Days Inn. Other than that, the hotel was cozy, quiet and substantially upscale, more like a private club than a hotel.",
            "My husband and I spent six days at the City Club celebrating our wedding anniversary. It was the week before Christmas and we were looking for an intimate, centrally-located hotel which would give us easy access to all the holiday sights of Manhattan. As it turned out, we were delighted with our choice and would definitely stay here again. For a start, we were pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room (second floor facing the street) - we entertained six people for drinks with no difficulty whatsoever. Comfortable bed and furniture - great bathroom with excellent products and wonderful shower. (I missed having a bathtub, but apparently there are some rooms that do.) Maid service was thorough and reliable - they leave huge and delicious chocolate chip cookies as part of their \"turn-down\" routine - a mixed blessing if you've just had an enormous dinner! However, what really set this trip apart was the charming and helpful staff. It seemed as if nothing was too much trouble for any of them, and every request - tickets, a cab, a dinner reservation, directions, info. about skating, shopping etc. etc. - was handled efficiently with a smile. We never had to wait for help at the front desk, which can sometimes be a problem in larger hotels - and people like David and Juliette (?) started to feel almost like friends by the end of the week. As with any hotel, there were some minor negatives - the lobby is very small, and waiting there would be a problem as there's nowhere to sit. The room could definitely do with more storage ( and there's no point in having an \"invisible\" closet door that won't stay closed!) Some reviews mentioned the lack of lighting in the bathroom, but there is in fact a less-than-obvious dimmer switch - maybe a small discreetly-placed sign would help. All in all , we had a fabulous time. Thank you, City Club, for making our special trip one to remember- we'll be back!",
            "I am a regular customer at the City Club. I usually stay at this wonderful hotel for business. This is definitely a chic hotel located in the heart of Manhattan. The decor is fabolous and the room is adequately supplied with various kinds of amenities but don't indulge too much since a can of soda can be quite pricey. Times Square and the broadway theatres is a short 5 min walk away. The staff is unbelievably friendly. I was quite suprised that they remembered my name during my first night there. I love how they leave freshly made chocolate chip cookies in the evening. The rooms are very quiet which is remarkable due to its location. The quality was great for its value, plus the beds are quite comfy. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone. You will not be disappointed.",
            "City Club Hotel was a nice surprise. We got a great deal at Cheaprooms.com and to our surprise it was chic and very close to what we were doing. (Bryant Park, Dinner,etc...) The desk clerk was very elegant and even gave us a room upgrade because they didn't have the room I pre-booked. It seems like a small hole-in-th-wall, but inside it was inviting and the rooms were very col and comfortable. We will definately stay again in the future.",
            "I had a standard room and asked for a room off the street. Overlooking a narrow alley, on the sixth floor, there was no view and it was a little dark but that didn't matter at all to me. The room and bathroom were well organized.The divan under the window offers a nice option for reading at the end of the day. The bed, voluminous feather pillows and high quality Frette linens were heavenly and luxuriously comfortable. The bathroom was nicely equipped and the room was completely silent. I didn't care for the television which is really an old fashioned tube style positioned behind a window to give a flat screen effect. But, then again, I wasn't there to watch television. I peaked into larger rooms when the doors were open and they looked nice. My husband joined me for the weekend and there was enough room for two in the standard room. The location, between 5th and 6th avenues was ideal for my business and evening activities... the theatre district is two blocks westward on Broadway. I didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food. On my next trip, I tried the Hotel Mela up the street because it was a bit less expensive and was so sorry I'd switched..tiny, ordinary, noisy. he City Club is the hotel for me next time I go to NYC.",
            "I travel regularly for business and always stay at The Sunset Tower when I'm in LA. I am always pleased with the service so I decided to give the sister property in New York a try. What a mistake. The hotel is no where near the level of The Sunset Tower. The rooms were ok, but the service was terrible. Clearly the management of the hotel needs to be re-evaluated. The staff seemed clueless and no one was eager to please at all. When I'm travelling I am generally stressed and don't feel like dealing with incompetence. There was confusion at check in and I was downgraded to a room that supposedly had a queen sized bed, though I can't say I believe it was. Room service was a disaster. I kept being transferred between the restaurant and the front desk, with no one wanting to actually take my order. Like I said, I'm a frequent traveler so I understand that things can go wrong, but this hotel was just not up to my standards. I won't be staying there in the future, nor will I reccomend it to anyone else. I'm hoping that The Sunset Tower keeps it's standards a bit higher and doesn't follow suit and become a mess like the City Club!",
            "I spent two nights here last December when, along with family and half the world, I came to Manhattan to see a show and enjoy the town, all decked out for Christmas. The hotel was recommended to me by my brother, who stays here frequently. Still, I was surprised to step off the street into this sort of large hallway that passes for the lobby. At the end of the lobby/hallway is the reception desk - stepping up to reception feels more like buying a ticket than checking in to a hotel - but then you get your key and around the corner you go to the elevators and up to where a normal-sized hotel awaits you! Pretty neat! The room was nicely appointed, the bathroom marbled to a fare-thee-well. This is an efficient, high standard urban bolt hole and I liked it a lot.",
            "I only stayed for one night - excellent location. The room furnishings are very nice (contemporary and warm) and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was well appointed, and luxurious, albeit small. My bedroom windows were covered with drawn shades when I arrived, and when I opened them, they both looked directly at a brick wall only a few feet from the outside glass. As such, my room felt like an interior room on a cruise ship with no windows. This would be unacceptable to some. I dealt with it, but it made the room very \"claustrophobic\" feeling. Small complaint - I did not receive turn down service however my \"do not disturb\" sign was hanging on the door until about 5pm. Still, it would have been nice for them to attempt to turn down the room after 5pm. I arrived back around 11pm to find my room unserviced. Another small complaint is that the room doors are fairly loud when they close, and throughout the night several people came and went on our floor and the noise that their doors made when closing was startlingly loud. The walls are thin, and noise travels easily in this hotel. Another small complaint - the wireless internet is awful, but the wired internet is fine. Bigger compaint - the heating/cooling unit in the room was unacceptably noisy. All night long it was turning on and off every 15 minutes, and the noise was enough to prevent a good nights sleep. To give an idea - the unit was noisy enough that if you were watching TV and it came on, the TV volume needed to be roughly doubled to continue to hear it. Upon checkout, the front desk agent didn't bother to ask how my stay was, which was surprising. This is an acceptable hotel, but not one I'd try again. Too many other good choices in the city without the small annoyances that made my stay somewhat less than enjoyable.",
            "I booked this place mainly based on location. Its off the beaten path of Times Square, but still walking distance. Wanted a nice place to help celebrate a dear friends birthday. I arrived early and was checked in, dropped my stuff off. Room wasn't ready. So we went and brunched and were called as soon as a room was available. Upon getting into the room, the room was small. But it was so well laid out, it didn't seem small in the least. What a most effiicient use of space. The upscale bathroom amenties had my friend and I \"fighting\" over them. But since its his birthday, he got them. Between shows, we were greeted by some amazing tasty cookies waiting for us in the room. After the 2nd Broadway show we saw, went back to the room to freshenup and hit the clubs. But the combination of walking around and the comfy comfy bed, we called it a night. Shame but next time I come back, I am definfately staying a longer time!",
            "Found hotel on hotels.com. Price was very good, and the hotel mached it when I came in. it was $30 below the normal rate. They then gave us a free upgrade. The room was amazing. Turn down service was included and came with chocolate chip cookies. The staff its very friendly and helpful.",
            "I stayed here just one night, traveling for work. Like everyone else says, the location is perfect and the hotel itself looks great and the staff was very friendly. I booked a queen room and was upgraded to the 2 story king. Great concept and lovely room. Only problem with being on 44th was the noise. Holy cow. It was loud until 4am and then only quiet for an hour. This might not bother many other people, but trying to fall asleep when you're two hours ahead of your natural clock is hard when it's loud. So, if quiet is really important to you - be sure to tell the front desk. They were super nice and helpful. Now, about that couch with the blanket...guys, really? I love a bed and breakfast, and can appreciate \"homeyness\" when appropriate - but that couch is old, dirty and uncomfortable. Might consider this for replacement, and wash the blanket. Gross. Turn down cookies and breakfast menu at 7:30 were nice touches, although I didn't get to enjoy breakfast. Room service was timely and prompt with delivery. The guy said he'd be back in an hour to pick up the tray, I waited 90 minutes and called for pickup. 30 minutes later I placed the tray outside of my room, put the dnd sign on the door and went to bed. All in all, I would stay here again. Loved the concept, the location and free wireless internet. I'd just ask for a quiet room and go out for dinner.",
            "I can not believe that I have never stayed here before. It is in a great location (44th between 5th and 6th) and a very personable boutique hotel environment. If you need big crowds and big lobbies, don't go here, but if you like a nice room, nice people, a good locations, try it. My room was big for NYC standards and had a king size bed, a big table, nice comfy chair and a window seat. The TV was like a 47\" or 50\" set too! :). Bathroom well equiped - big shower and big sink, you weren't balancing your stuff on top of things you would rather not touch... Only complaint was that the room was warm even with AC cranked, but I would go here every time my budget allowed!",
            "We found this hotel on an internet search, selected it due to its location near the theater where we were seeing a show the following day, but would definitely stay here again even if we were not seeing a show. The rooms, and amenities you can see for yourself on the internet, what the site will not tell you is the personal service the staff gives to their guests. Upon our arrival, we were upgraded, which just set the tone for our entire visit. We were traveling with Sam, our Shih Tzu and we cannot thank Hugo, the Front Office Manager, enough he went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. He personally looked after Sam for us as the show was going to get us back to the hotel later than Sam's schedule. Our room was well appointed in addition to having interesting architecture, the bed linens and bath towels were luxurious.",
            "We booked a stay at the City Club for mid-July 2006. We booked the reservation on the hotel's website and thought we booked a queen-sized room. When we arrived, and despite the email confirmation I received and had with me, the hotel informed us that the only available room was a petite room, which was a full bed in a room that would have been better as a janitor's closet because it was so small. Although the bathroom was lovely, my husband and I barely fit in the room together. The TV was not a flat screen, but rather a 19 inch regular old TV. What a disappointment. We were told that the hotel's computerized booking system erred and resulted in us booking the wrong room. To his credit, the hotel manager tried to find us a room at another nearby hotel, but apparently they were sold out as well. The manager then discounted our rate, gave us a bottle of wine and free breakfast for the two mornings of our stay. The only reason I would stay here again is that the manager kept in email contact with me (I preferred email -- he offered to call instead) regarding our room and was quite helpful. The room, however, was so small and the bed so uncomfortable, that next time, rather than take the chance of this type of error happening again, I'd probably stay at the sort of big hotel I was trying to avoid in the first place.",
            "Unless you have to stay on W44th Street for some reason, check into the Kimpton, Sofitel, or any number of places that will make you feel welcome no matter the size of your pocketbook. This place should return to being a private men's club, since it has no amenities for women: cold, hard floors with no rugs, no tubs unless you request one, no good mirrors in the bathroom, with dull, dim lights in the bathroom. No room to place place jewelry, books, or whatever - one small desk with a blotter. And to save space, the TVs are placed behind the mirror - what genius thought of this? You get horrible glare, the picture is blurred, and it's a most unwatchable experience. The closet door hits the wall scone when it opens, plus you can't walk around the bed and have the closet open at the same time. The towels were nice and the bed linens were clean, but having no rugs in the room, and having poor insulation around the windows makes for a very cold and icky stay. My room was on the 2nd floor above the restaurant kitchen which made for greasy cooking smells starting at 5:45 am. When I was 30 mins late for check out the front desk acted as if I had left a bloody carcass in the room - carrying on so, talking over me, lying (saying they called several time when they did not) and speaking to me not in the manner you want to hear after dropping $1100 on their stinking, small, dark, overpriced, overrated room! Sorry - I rant. But save yourself some stress and stay elsewhere.",
            "I spent 7 nights there last Easter with my family. We had a family suite which consists on a queen and king rooms at the end of the corridor connected by a door that closes allowing the rooms to gain a spacious foyer. Our stay there was excellent, both the staff at reception and at the door were young and very helpful and attentive. We found the rooms to be a decent size for a family of 5 adults, nicely appointed with some well thought details. We had a double bed in each room as well as a daybed (the one in the king bedroom was a bit tight so we used the one in the queen room); it was made everyday, as opposed to what someone said in a previous post. The location on 44th between 5th and 6th, right opposite the Royalton can' t be beat. I strongly recommend it and would definetly return if we can book a similar rate.",
            "The City Club provided the perfect setting for our recent romantic getaway to New York. We were allowed to check in 3 hours early...the staff and service was excellent...there is discounted garage parking across the street...the room was larger than expected for such a boutique hotel...room and bathroom were clean...trendy, modern decor throughout...there is free internet access and a free computer to use on the second floor lounge. the restaurant next door is supposed to be amazing...however we didnt eat there, b/c we wanted to explore other parts of the city. while some might be turned off from the \"dark\" feel throughout the hotel (dim lighting, dark-earth tones in the bathrooms, etc...) we thought it only added to the experience. the biggest drawback was the view of the brick wall and the bathroom was small but ample. however, we weren't in the room much (its New York after all) so it didn't really bother us at all. by far, the hotel's greatest asset is its location. nestled right between 6th and 5th avenue, and just blocks away from Times Square, Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building, the only time we had to hop in a cab was to explore greenwhich village and the financial district. we would stay at the City Club again in a heartbeat...",
            "Ended up here with a last minute booking via Hotelclub after the debacle of Dream Apartments (see other review) - and it was marvellous - well above expectations. The toiletries provided were large and good quality and replenished daily. Friendly and helpful staff with the room always immaculate and luggage handled quickly and efficiently. The bed was large (although the free update to their second level of room - the Queen Luxe - probably helped there) and extremely comfortable. The lighting was a little fiddly but the dimmer switches (which they did explain on check in, but I wasn't listening properly due to fatigue), once you worked them out, actually made it easy to get the lighting how you wanted it. The TV was behind a mirror which was a bit odd, and the mirror kept making me think there was another room through the gap in the wall (it was placed to look a bit like a doorway). I have to scrape the bottom of the barrel to find a negative, but the heating and cooling was a bit temperamental. I'm not sure if they're always this good or we got lucky, or indeed whether the middlepersons arranging the booking had asked them to look after us (following the previous experience with the other place). In any case I can warmly recommend this hotel to anyone requiring a comfortable place to stay in midtown Manhatten.",
            "City Club hotel is definitely botique. Cost was fair (~300/night) given that it was 5 family members and the proximity to Times Square. Staff was friendly and helpful. The room did not have a lot of space for luggage/hanging clothes and desperately needs more hooks to hang towels. HVAC was challenging (a lot of fluctuation between hot and cold). Very convenient to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and shopping. Parking garage right across from the hotel ($45/night!). Hotel signage out front was very limited. Unless you know the exact address, you'll drive and then walk right by it.",

            "What a great find! I found a great, conveniently located hotel in New York City -- the City Club Hotel. We traveled to New York on dec. 26 to attend an event in the theater district. The rooms were cozy and well appointed -- very modern looking. The lighting added to the appeal (think trendy night club lighting). The bed was very comfortable and the tv was a good size. We had free wifi and I thought the nightly rate was perfect! The room also had a built in day bed which was nice. We will surely stay there again. There is a diner next door for breakfast, a parking lot across the street and it is in walking distance to time square.",
            "Stayed for three nights, great value for the location and quality of accommodation. It's tight on space but nicely decorated and they've packed a lot of features and style into the place. However, the toiletries were not replenished during the stay until I requested and the room cleaning was minimal at best. We ate once in the restaurant downstairs and enjoyed the burgers ! The location is fantastic. No gym or pool but vouchers given for a nearby one. I'll stay there again but expect slightly less than I did this time - or will be aware that I need to keep on the housekeeping staff to have beds made and towels changed !"

Breakfast was plentiful-cold cereal, great coffee, yogurt and a wonderful basket of croissants, breads and pastries. The staff allowed us to store our bags there before and after our stay and, best of all, were really friendly and gave excellent information. In addition, we loved the location of the hotel-within walking distance to the main sights of Paris and two blocks from the Rue Mouffetard, full of charming bistros. It's possible to walk to Notre Dame, Pantheon, Jardin de Plantes, Jardin du Luxembourg ...",

Located in the 5th district, it is very close in the Latin Quarter and the area with some very nice restaurants, bars and nightlife. Also, very close to three metro stations and the Gare Austerlitz, where one can get a train to the Varsailles palace. Finally, it is located within 5 minutes of the Botanical garden, which is a hidden gem. The hotel offers breakfast, which was the typical fresh baguettes, croissants and pain de chocolat, with some very nice coffee. A great bakery across the street was a definate complement. If you want to see why French people love their bakeries, line up at the start of the day outside a bakery. The hotel decor and furniture definately needs some major renovation. The room was very small, even by Paris standards, although the bed was comfortable. Sound insulation was not that good, but being so tired at the end of the day, it did not matter much.

            "I am a seasoned traveller and was lucky enough to have 2 weekends in a row in Paris recently. The first time I stayed with a friend in the Hotel Acte V around the corner from this one. It was great 3 star, modern refurb, friendly staff, great bar and lounge area, large well furnished rooms, aircdon, flat screen tv, little balconies, quiet, great location. For the second trip which was a romantic weekend away with my husband sans enfant I choose the 'sainte christophe' *because it was 150 points higher* than the Acte V on Trip advisor. What a *terrible* mistake. We couldn't believe it when we arrived to the drab, dated, run down place with no aircon and hot still little rooms (so hot other guests on the same floor were lying on their beds in the heat with the doors open for all to see!) This place is a 1 star compared to the Acte V and just shows how the good Trip Advisor system can be distorted wrongly and good hotels (and ultimately travellers pay). I have learnt from this run a mile from a hotel that appears on 'trip advisor' where every guest comment is followed by a management one thanking them as it shows the hotel doesn't have time to clean rooms properly (our room had a pile of old towels on the floor when we got there) or refurb. I know you can do much better for the money than the Sainte Christophe. They wouldn't let us cancel our booking for the first night but we stayed at the Acte V the second for sure thankfully.",

The neighbourhood is very quiet for a big city, so getting a good night's sleep was not a problem! Located in the center of the lating quarter you are only about a 10-15 minute walk from the Notre Dame. The rooms are small, but very cosy - definitely big enough for what you need them for: sleep & shower! The only \"bad\" thing that I have to say is that the beds are a little to short to my liking and my partner's height, but they were otherwise very comfortable! The breakfast is simple & filling, enough to get you started. If you're looking for a bacon-and-eggs style of breakfast you won't find it here. The hotel also offers free Wi-FI, handy if you bring your laptop for some on-site sight/resturant research! We would definitely return to this hotel!

We have no problem with litlle rooms, and even prefer the intimate feeling. But it was really too litlle! In addition, we asked, in advance, if there is a possibility, to make an early check in- we mentioned that i am pregnant in an advanced stage, and that our flight arrives early. We were answed that there will be no problem unless all the rooms will be occupied- an answer we found reasonably fair. Though, with our arrival we were told that there is no possibility to an early check in, since the hotel is full. Nonetheless, checking the hotel website, in the day of our arrival- there were 5 (!!!) double available rooms. It is true that no one owed us a thing- It is just the feeling that no gesture of good will was done. And it was the main problem during all our stay- the service was basic, and it seemed that no-one tries to halp wholeheartedly. That was the common attitude in the front desk and with the morning breakfest staff- who never smiled but looked very eager to ask the room number- giving an unpleasent feeling. So... the hotel still has its great location, reasonable price and basic but clean rooms, but there seems to be comparable possibilitis with batter attitude to the gustes.",

Staff were very friendly and helpful in providing information on public transport options and spoke English quite well which was helpful as my French was limited. Breakfast was a little overpriced at 9 euro a day but you got a couple of pastries, yogurt, cereal and a choice of juice or tea or coffee. The location was quiet at night and a supermarket, pharmacy and the local metro station were very close by. Most of the attractions were in walking distance with the Pantheon very nearby. Would definitely recommend this other travellers - it was a great place to stay in Paris.",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Saint Christophe in April 2011 for five nights. We arrived early and our room was not yet ready. The reception staff offered to have the room ready within an hour if we needed to rest before beginning our touring. Our double room was well sized for Paris, clean, and extremely quiet. We were able to walk to all the tourists sights, except Montmarte and the Eiffel Tower. It's close to Rue Mouffetarde, which is packed with restaurants, cafes, and shops. Several metro stations are close; the neighborhood is safe at night. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast is a bit boring but included in the room price and adequate (great coffee). I would recommend this hotel for those who want a well-located, comfortable, budget-friendly hotel in Paris.",
            "On short notice we decided to take a trip to Paris over Thanksgiving. I was looking for a place on the right bank, but Hotel Saint Christophe had the right price. Our local travel agent helped book our stay. I had been warned that some 3-star hotels are not what they seem or what we would expect. From the moment of our arrival, we knew we had booked a great hotel. We arrived just after the beginning of the train strikes. The front desk staff was wonderful in giving directions, checking our train schedule (for traveling to the Loire Valley later in the week), and helping to arrange a tour to Versailles (since the trains weren't running). I have never seen such attentive staff! The rooms were clean--mine was on the 6th floor, had a balcony, and contrary to other reviews, the room and bathroom were of good size. My sister's was on the first floor, had 2 twin beds (kind of narrow), and had an even bigger room and bathroom. BOTH rooms were quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was simple, filling, and the staff were nice--coffee, croissants, rolls, cheese, yogurt, cereal, butter, and jam. The local flea market was great! Meats, cheeses, clothes, and treats! Hotel Saint Christophe is fairly centrally located--only 15 min walk to Notre Dame, 15 min walk to Gare Austerlitz, and many shops within a 10 min walking radius. We had a wonderful stay--we will return. Thanks!",
            "We have just returned from the St Christophe and a long weekend in Paris with our 3 children and partners to celebrate my 60th birthday. The hotel is very well situated for the metro (Monge) and for eating out on rue Mouffetard. As we were arriving on different days, I found that I could not book on any website - or I could, but would not have been certain of getting us all in - so I booked directly with the hotel. They were not willing to offer me the same deals available on websites (inclusive breakfast.. or even a free night) but the price was a not unreasonable 110euros per 'double' room. The \"children's\" rooms were all quite adequate; fairly small but clean and quite comfortable. Ours (24), unfortunately, was incredibly tiny and cramped with barely room to walk round the small double bed, the top of which was hemmed in by the only storage 'cupboards', so if you turned over too energetically in the middle of the night you crashed your elbow against them! The worst part was having next door's bathroom - and the lift shaft - in our room, hence the severe lack of space. So, do ensure that you specify that you do NOT want a room ending in 4! These rooms are certainly not of an appropriate size for 2 people - and would only suit someone a little on the deaf side! The reception staff were charming and helpful in every respect. They did try to see if an alternate room was available for us, but informed us that there wasn't one. I cannot comment on breakfast as we never managed to eat there - the breakfasting area was tiny and full the first morning, so we ate at a bar further up rue Monge on the left (les petits \u00e9coliers?) for 4e90. there is also an excellent boulangerie opposite and a good supermarket, Ed, on the other side of rue Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de heading for rue Mouffetard. [--] AMF",
            "This review is long overdue. My wife and i spent 10 nights at the Hotel Saint Christophe and after researching over 100 hotels we decided on this one. Wow did we ever luck out. Located in the Latin Quarter this location couldnt be better. We walked to most sights, @ 10 mins to the Notre Dame and the Metro was 1 block away. The rooms were bigger than i expected, and very clean and quiet. While we were there i just had to stop and check a few of the other hotels on my list, they were'nt even close to being as nice as the Hotel Saint Christophe. Our room included breakfast and it was a great way to start the day. As nice as the rooms and location were, the staff was excellent, always very pleasant and helpful and made out stay better than i ever inagined. when we come back to Paris we will definately stay here again and save myself hours of researching. I have already recommended this hotel to frinds of mine that are planning Paris this year. To the staff there if u remember us, we got you a fresh baguette daily. Thank you very much for a great stay in Paris. Hope to see you again.",
            "Location was not as close to Notre Dame as advertised, but still within a long walk. Some of the staff friendly and helpful. Our room was very small with old furniture, but clean. The bathroom was fine. First night the room was hot and had to sleep with the window open and the street noise was very loud. I asked the hotel staff to book and paid them directly for an airport shuttle for an early morning flight. I was in the lobby waiting for the shuttle and showed the desk clek my receipt. He called the driver in to get our luggage and help us board. To make a long story shorter I had been boarded on the wrong shuttle and therefore missed my flight and other connections. It was very expensive for me to rebook my flights. I called the hotel to see if they would at least refund my 2 nights stay to help offset my expenses. They would not accept responsibility nor would they offer anything other than a very weak apology.",
            "We stayed at St Christophe which is in the Latin Quarter in Paris in March of 2008. It was a wonderful location; right next to the Metro, walking distance to many restaurants and night life, and Notre Dame. The rooms were nice and the elevator was hilarious! I wouldn't suggest paying extra for the breakfasts. You can get more at the pastry shop across the street for less. The bathrooms were very nice and the water pressure was to die for. The rates were a little higher than I\u2019d like but it was well worth it. My favorite was the large tub with the gorgeous window that you could look out of while relaxing in a nice hot bath (which you will need for all of the walking! ).",
            "My husband and I just came back home from staying at the Hotel Saint Christophe in the Latin Quarter. We chose this hotel because of its reviews on this website, and we were not disappointed. The location is fantastic - just literally a 2 minute walk from the Place Monge subway, although we preferred to walk down to the Seine, by the Notre Dame, which is just merely about a 20 minute walk on Rue Monge. The staff at the hotel were always extremely friendly, helpful and courteous, the rooms were very clean and the bed very comfortable. We never heard any noises from the room next door, above or below us. Rue Monge is a little noisy, but we kept the front window closed at night, and left the bathroom window opened instead. Rue Mouffetard is just a short walk up from Rue Lecepede, where the hotel is located, and there is a vibrant nightlife there, with tons of restaurants, cafes, bakeries, supermarket, etc. We would most definitely stay at the Hotel Saint Christophe again, and would not hesitate to recomment it to other. Merci beaucoup!!! Au revoir!",
            "This hotel is essentially average. Given the multitude of choices in Paris, it's hard to go out and recommend it, but on the other hand there are a lot of worse places out there. The big plus is the location, which is essentially next to a Metro stop, as well as close to many shops/restaurants. The proximity to the university helps there. Also, the staff is quite friendly and helpful. There is also a computer, albeit a very slow one, with complimentary internet. Once you get used to the non-QWERTY European keyboard, it can come in handy. On the negative side of things, the cleanliness of the rooms isn't exactly top-notch. Not unusual for trash cans to not be cleaned, carpets to not be vacuumed, etc. Never mind personal items being strangely moved at times. Plus, the rooms can have a musty smell. Also, the rooms are very small (Tokyo small) but maybe not that unusual for Paris. And the lack of free wifi internet is becoming more of an issue now that so many hotels include it in their rate. As a side note, the breakfast should be avoided simply b/c it's not worth the cost. You can go to one of the many bakeries in the area and get much more for less than half the price. Overall, I don't think I'd necessarily stay again, but if you perhaps get a great deal, then it might be worth trying this hotel out...",
            "We stayed here mid-week from 21 to 25 January 2008 and our experience was superb. The hotel is situated close to Notre Dame, in a good area near to some lovely bars, cafes and restaurants. It is ideally located for exploring Paris on foot, but for the less active it is also close to a number of Metro stations. The hotel staff were faultlessly helpful and friendly. The reception staff spoke excellent English which was perfect given my rusty French. We had a room on the fifth floor which was cosy but very comfortable and warm. Outside street noise was not a problem. Most importantly, the room, bathroom and bed linen were spotlessly clean. However, some travellers may wish to take note that the size of the room and the small lift which serves each of the floors might prove problematic for wheelchairs. The hotel facilities included a small breakfast room where a decent continental breakfast was served, and an internet room. To be honest, we didn't expect or require much more. All in all this hotel was a real charm and I would certainly stay here again.",
            "Good quality, mid-range Parisien hotels have always eluded us.....until now. The Saint Christophe is a little gem, and we will definitely use it when we return to Paris again. The staff were helpful and courteous; the room was exceptional (for a Parisien hotel! ), in that its decor was unobtrusive, it was clean, all the plumbing worked, it was medium-sized but with sufficient storage areas for two people for 4 nights and the bed was very comfortable; the lift was fine (I don't understand why some people in their reviews of this hotel make a fuss about the size of the lift!) ; and breakfast was sufficient - very french, and with the choice of cheese and yoghurt as well the usual juice, tea/coffee/chocolate, croissant, rolls and jam, it could just do with the addition of a bowl of fresh fruit for customers to pick at. The reception area helpfully carries daily newspapers, a daily weather report and a pc terminal, and is a pleasant, light area in which to sit too. Situation-wise, the hotel is excellent, just a few minutes walk from the metro monge. The Jardin des Plantes is 5 minutes walk one way, and the student/market area starting at Place Contrescarpe is 5 minutes the other way. Here you can get practically any type of food you could wish for - vegetarian, italien, spanish, algerian, asian, turkish, greek, moroccan, etc etc. You can also get right to the heart of many parisien sights within 20-30 minutes walk eg. notre dame, boulevard st michel, cluny museum etc. The hotel will store your luggage for free, once you've checked out. In all, a really great hotel, well worth the money.",
            "We had traveled in june. We had booked 2 rooms double and twin., (1 couple, 1 teenage daughter and grandmother). . The rooms was sufficent in size, the bed and pillows were very comfortable. A portable fan was provided. Our window remained closed during the night related to the street noise. The room did not have air conditioner. I would not feel comfortable if we had booked it in aug when it would be hot. the bathroom had a tub/shower. The staff was very accommadating and nice.They did speak english very well. They had recommeded resturants in the area, arranged our transportation to the airport. The area is clean and safe. I would recommend it for famiiles. The hotel does have a lift. The hotel was close to the Metro, Plenty of resturants within walking distance to choose from! Breakfast : cold cereal, yoguart, tea/coffee/ orange juice/ plenty of the croissants/breads! We would recommend this hotel for anyone.",
            "We stayed at this hotel for four nights in September 2008. We found the location to be excellent as it's a very short walk to many dining locations and the Metro. We found the front desk staff to be very friendly and hospitable. The room was small, but it is what we expected for a room in Paris. We found the room to be clean, and that is all we wanted as we only use the room for sleeping! There is just too much to see and do in Paris! We can't comment on the breakfast as we didn't eat at the hotel, but picked up food as we walked around the city. We would definately stay here again, and would recommend this hotel to our friends.",
            "We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 19 day trip to France in September 2007. We wanted somewhere reasonable and central for exploring Paris, but not a modern cookie-cutter hotel room. This hotel was clean, quiet, convenient but still had the old world charm we were looking for, right in the Latin Quarter (arrondissement 5). It's located near Jardin des Plantes, and within easy walking distance to the Panth\u00e9on and Notre Dame. It's very near two M\u00e9tro stops (Place Monge and Cardinal Lemoine). I think the latter was better for suitcases as there were less stairs. Breakfast is served in the basement, nothing fancy but enough to get you going in the morning. If we ever had any questions, the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room overlooked the street, but was quiet and very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.",
            "We stayed in the Saint Christophe for a week. It was overall a very pleasant location. The location is perfect: very nice neighborhood and the hotel is right on top of a subway station. The rooms were very nice and clean, the bathrooms were exceptionally clean and well equipped. WiFi internet was available at no charge. Breakfast was OK according to French standards but the staff serving it was a bit sloppy sometimes. The price was great for Paris. I would certainly recommend it to anyone.",
            "We stayed in this hotel for four nights in early September, 2006. I agree with the review, two below, \"Comfortable....\". We love this neighborhood, and the Contrescarpe square just minutes from this hotel. One issue to consider. Paris is noisy at night. Very few 3-star hotels have air conditioning (including this one). If you are there when it is warm at night, you will need the window open and you will hear a good deal of noise from Rue Monge all night. I would stay at this hotel again if in a cool season but would pay more for a hotel with AC if in warm weather.",
            "We stayed here for 5 nights in 2006, on the recommendation of a French friend and previous tripadvisor reviews. On our experience, we would be happy to stay here again. Staff were welcoming and friendly, able to point us towards a local square containing several cafes and restaurants and a vibrant nightlife - it seemed like staying in a small village, rather than a capital city. The inhouse breakfast is plain and basic, but there are plenty of eateries to hand, and the Seine and Notre Dame are within an easy walk. The room was small but very clean and comfortable, with a shuttered bathroom window - one could recline in the bath and feel the city just outside. Romantic, and the whole setting is just right as a stepping point to explore the city.",
            "We just had 3 nights at the St Christpohe and loved it. This is our 3rd trip to Paris and this hotel and location was the best so far. Very close to place monge metro, market and shops. Walk to saint germaine, pantheon. Staff were really friendly and helpful. The room were ok size for Paris, a little dated but clean and a good bathroom. My only concern was that the rooms were a little hot - they do provide a fan though. When we were there it was nice weather but not all that hot, so I am not sure if we would have enjoyed our stay so much if it had have been over 25 degrees. Apart from that though it is a great hotel and you will struggle to find better value in Paris. We will be back!",
            "We stayed at the St. Christophe in September, 2007, and we'd gone to Paris for a honeymoon trip. (We're older newlyweds; my husband had never been to Paris, and it was my first trip in over 30 years.) We liked the hotel very, very much--especially the two large windows in the room and the lovely, clean bathroom-- and we are thinking about booking here again for a trip this coming November. We had gotten a rate that included breakfast, and the servers in the breakfast room were polite and helpful. (The bakery across the street is indeed excellent, and the people there very nice and helpful.) The restaurants immediately surrounding the hotel are a bit touristy, but I think that the people at the desk would make recommendations if asked--and, of course, the hotel is conveniently located.",
            "We spent five nights at the hotel and had a wonderful time in paris. I would agree with most of the reviews- the hotel is small, clean and in a real- not touristy area. I watched the neighbourhood life going on through the windows as I woke up in the morning. I would say that the hotel seemed very warm and I probably would have found it too hot in the summer.It is in an ideal location for the local metro, small cafes etc up at the place de la contrascope where we ate most evenings. The room at the front was noisy but we expected that as we were in a busy capital city.",
            "We stayed there twice this year & were very impressed with the location- just where we wanted to be, central but but quiet. The decor was either right up to date & retro or still left over from the 70s. I suspect the latter. The staff were very helpful, the rooms very clean & comfortable- the lift was minute. Breakfast was good. They seemed to want to lock the front door as early as they could but always opened it promptly. I don't know how family friendly it is but it was ideal for two adults A really good find right in the Latin Quarter, not too cheap/not too pricey...good value.",
            "My friend and I stayed for 4 nights. Loveley and clean. Metro nearby and central to all attractions. Rooms on the small side but had all you need, only nitpick tea and coffee making facilities would be nice. Breakfast was great and all the staff spoke better english than my friend and I speak french. Some lovely cafes nearby too. Would recommend to anyone spending a few days in Paris.",
            "Stayed for a weekend in February - the hotel is undergoing some exterior renovation but we experienced NO noise and the windows were not really blocked at all - so dont worry about that unless you stay during the week and plan to spend all day sitting inside your hotel room! Friendly staff, decent breakfast (baguettes, croissants, cereal, yogurts, etc). Down the street from huge park and about 2 blocks from Mouffetard (lots of restaurants/shops/great Sunday marketplace). Less than 3 minute walk from Metro (Place Monge) and there is another metro stop on a different line a little bit further up the street.",
            "We stayed for 8 nights in room 64, on the sixth floor up under the eaves with a sloping ceiling. Small room, as expected, but lovely and clean. Two big windows opening onto small balconies. Good for catching a nice breeze. Location was great- walking distance to most major attractions and also close to many public transit options. Nice neighbourhood to wander in. We bought breakfast each morning at a bakery across the street and walked to the Jardin des Plantes to eat sitting on a bench under the Cedar of Lebanon tree. Reception was wonderful - fluent in English and always friendly and very helpful. Appreciated the free internet usage for quick emails home. Highly recommended!",
            "Thanks to Trip Advisor and those of you who submitted reviews of this lovely hotel. We spent 4 nights at the Saint Christophe 21-25 September 05. Yes, the rooms are fairly small - but aren't they in most European hotels - however, the staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and the location is great. It was nice to be away from the really touristy areas and really enjoy the local Parisian life surrounding the hotel. At the same time we were only a few metres from the closest metro station to take us anywhere around town, and within a 30 minute walk of Notre Dame. Have to say that the little Pastiseries not far from the metro station have treats to die for! Would highly recommend this property and would stay there again next time we're in Paris.",
            "My wife booked this little gem of a hotel for a recent weekend in Paris and would def have to recommend it. It is really central within the Latin Quarter and right beside the Metro, lots of restaurants and bars, and within walking distance of many of the main sites. We arrived at noon and had a great welcome at reception with lots of recommendations. The rooms are Paris size (smallish) - but very comfortable and clean. Again, throughout our stay the staff were very helpful and polite.",
            "The hotel we had previously stayed at in Paris was booked on our dates so we decided to stay in a different area i.e. the left bank. This hotel stood out as the reviews on one of the websites were personally responded to by the management. This meant that they cared about their customers. Hotel was easy to find just round the corner from Place Monge Metro and Jussieu and Cardinal Limone were a short walk away. We were on the 6th floor. We could see the top of the Eiffel Tower from our window. Our room was smallish but clean and had all necessary requirements. We had breakfast included with the booking deal. The breakfast was ideal - cereal, yoghurt, bread and criossants with juice and tea or coffee. The servers were friendly. The hotel is in a quiet part of Paris just off the Rue Monge and we found no problems sleeping.",
            "This is a charming little hotel in a lovely area of Paris. Nice, spotlessly clean room with comfy bed and lots of storage space. We really enjoyed our stay there. If you like a quiet room I'd suggest a room to the back as the street outside is very noisy at all hours, especially if you have to open windows due to lack of air con. Really liked hotel and would go back!",
            "Firstly thanks to all of you who take the time to write reviews, I spent a lot of time on the site to pick a hotel within budget but suitable for my fussy younger sister and was very pleased with this recommendation. The biggest highlight for us which probably can not be guaranteed was that our room was ready for us when we arrived at 09:30 after an early early trip on the Eurostar from London. Our room looked into a centre courtyard shared by the other buildings so absolutely no view but very quiet. The room was nothing to shout about but it was nice enough. The bathroom was small but I'd say in its defence it was a really nice bathroom by inexpensive hotel standards well laid out, totally modern, great shower pressure, clean and a nice sized shower. The staff were excellent in helping us located a place to eat - when we got back just before midnight, arranging our trip to Versailles and offered to arrange transport to the airport etc. This hotel is close to the metro and it was super easy to get around Paris. All in all a good experience.",
            "We stayed at the St Christophe recently for a short Paris trip. I checked out the hotel with tripadviser first and the reviews were right. The hotel is in a good position with a metro stop just round the corner. It is situated in the Latin Quarter with lively squares and streets a short walk away. The room itself was a little small but perfectly adequate for our needs. The bathroom was spotless as was the rest of the hotel. Linen was changed regularly even though we were only there for four days. Breakfast was continental and perfectly adequate. It was quiet at night and although a little hot (There was a bit of a heatwave) the hotel provided a fan in the room. The staff were friendly and helped us with booking trips etc. I would certainly stay here again.",
            "My partner and I stayed here for 10 days during Sept/11. We found the hotel to be very clean and quiet. The view was great with flowers in the window boxes on iron balconies which was very Parisienne. The room was a decent size and the bed was comfortable. We had a TV which did offer a couple of English stations and a radio in the room as well. The bathroom was clean with a full tub and shower and it had a window as well. We took the breakfast option which included coffee, juice, croissants and cheese and jellies which was very good. The hotel was in a good area, close to shops, pharmacies, cafes, restaurants, parksand the metro and bus routes.There was even a market which operated 2 days of the week. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay.",
            "There are good and weak points concerning the St Christophe. It is very reasonable for a 3 star hotel ( we paid about \u00a3340 for 3 nights in a double room B and B . )The location is excellent, right next to the Metro Place Monge and just a short trip into Paris.The area is full of restaurants and bars. Service was excellent and friendly with english spoken. The bathroom was clean and the shower excellent.You are also able to use the computer in the Reception area for free.The rooms are small and dark however and we did not have bedside lights. It was December but the room was always warm. There is only one english channel on the TV. Breakfast was adequate for 8 eu each but the breakfast room was small although welcoming. It might be a problem if the hotel was full. There is not much choice apart from 2 types of cereals, pain, croissants, yoghurt etc. The one major thing that concerned me is that there is just one central staircase plus a lift and if there was a fire and this was inaccessible , you would be in danger. There are no other fire exits. You would have to wait at the window for the fire brigade! Presumably the authorities have cleared it for safety? In the area, the best bistro we went to is L'Estrapade up near the Pantheon. This place was superb.",
            "We stayed for four nights at the Hotel Saint Christophe at the end of September. Very close to Place Monge with its thrice weekly market and metro stop, the Saint Christophe is decidedly convenient for the Latin Quarter and central Paris. Our room was located in the front of the hotel, and with the windows open, the street noise was almost unbearable. However, with the windows closed (not an option all times of year), it was relatively quiet. The bed was extremely small, though, making it difficult for two normal sized adults to sleep comfortably. There is some storage space, but the configuration made it difficult to access. The bathroom was clean and functional, but limited space made it challenging to access toiletries for two people. Shower gel and shampoo were provided in tiny tear packages, which we found insufficient for lathering up; bring your own. The breakfast room downstairs is mundane compared to many hotels of this sort, and the breakfast (included in our rate) even more so. While we're used to small continental breakfasts, good bread or croissants make them enjoyable. The service was generally gracious and inviting. We had one small problem with housekeeping leaving only one bath towel, met with the classic French \"Impossible!\" when we informed the front desk, but then rapidly resolved. All in all, we found this a solid property but nothing special.",
            "It took a Paris cab driver nearly 30 minutes to find this hotel after leaving the metro at St Michel. Can't understand why because I pointed her in the right direction and it was my first trip to Paris. It is a delightful hotel, small rooms but adequate. Lovely breakfast served in the basement and helpful on reception. About 15 min walk slightly downhill to Notre Dame but if you need the metro there is one just a few blocks away. A very enjoyable stay.",
            "This hotel is in an excellent location. Winthin walking distance to most major sites but still has a neighborhood feel. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is a perfect start to the day. The rooms are small the bathrooms are bigger than average. This is my favorite place to stay in Paris.",
            "The hotel was tucked away on a side street so it was very quiet. It is also located to numerous subway stops. The hotel itself is very small. The elevator was tiny, but it was able to accomodate both of us and our luggage. The room was average size for European standards. The staff was friendly and they spoke English. They willingly gave us directions to attractions and helped us book a shuttle back to CDG. If we make it back to Paris, we would stay here again.",
            "I booked this hotel based on other reviews, so after my experience I thought I should tell people mine. Although a good location and a comfortable room I found the staff quite unfriendly. The most unpleasant thing to happen was that half of my La Prairie eyecream had been used after returning from a day of sight seeing. I don't mean to sound spoilt but I saved up for this cream as a holiday treat and half of it had been scooped out and used - it was extremely obvious. From then on I locked all of my possesions (including toiletries) in my suitcase each morning and whenever I left the room. They do advise the use of the safe but I did not think that meant face products! I will never stay there again.",
            "A great place to land after an exhausting schedule. After a quick day in Paris and then travel to Brugge, Belgium and Beaune, Burgandy by train for four days, we stayed here for two nights. The room was large enough for a mature couple and the service was excellent. We appreciated having the internet and two TV channels in English. The bathroom was clean and the shower was large enough to bend over, which we hadn't had at other hotels. The staff spoke English for us and were helpful with directions for internet signup and local travel. I'd recommend this hotel to any traveller.",
            "The hotel manager was so heplful to confirm our shuttle booking to the airport, he did not mind to use his own cell phone and spoke French to clarify the pick up time. The ladies in the breakfast area were very friendly and courteous. The hotel was very closed to a nice ,hanging out place to find a decent dinner for a very good price (3- course meal with delicious desert for about 9 to 15 euros) .Good and central location Free hotel internet in the lobby.We traveled around Europe for 4 weeks ,stayed in several hotels ,from 2 to 4 stars , St. chistophe was the only hotel offered free internet.",
            "Hotel staff gave great restaurant recommendations, spoke English very well, always willing to help and answer our questions. Chose the hotel after reading other posts and am glad we did. Very quiet , our room was on the top floor.room was small, but expected this, but was clean, and having a mini fridge in our room stocked with cold drinks was a nice perk too. The hotel staff even helped to make arrangements for us to get back to the airport by shuttle when we checked out. Would definitely recommend staying here, address is 17 rue lacepede, near rue monge.",
            "This was an excellent hotel for my friend and me for our 5-day visit to Paris. We could walk to all of the centrally-located sites and there was a Metro stop and very nice outdoor market 1 block away. A number of the guests took the breakfast but we preferred the many cafes and boulangeries nearby (all less expensive). I had a TERRIBLE experience with the airport shuttle service. They picked me up on time but proceeded to spend over an hour driving all over Paris picking up other customers. If I hadn't had priority access on my airline, I would have missed my flight. But the hotel itself was a good value.",
            "We liked the location which is near the botanical gardens. The hotel is slightly out of the tourist mainstream but was only a 15 minute walk to Notre Dame. We stayed in two different rooms and both were small. The breakfast is standard and not worth the $12 price since there are pastry shops nearby and a morning food market at the Place Monge. The staff of this hotel are very friendly and accommodating.",
            "My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay. We had a wonderful experience with the Saint Christophe. After reading so many positive reviews on tripadvisor, we booked this hotel for our first visit to Paris. We were not disappointed. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were spotless and modern. The staff was lovely and accommodating. Breakfast was included in our rate and was perfect to hold us over until lunch. The location was ideal, as it is near two metro stops and also convenient to access most of Paris' center on foot. Book a room with confidence. We are particularly fussy travelers and have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel. We would gladly stay here again and are confident to recommend it to others.",
            "I have just returned from a weekend break with 5 friends to the Hotel St Christophe. The area around the hotel is typically Parisian, with lots of shops, restaurants and cafes, with a wonderful market in the Place Monge. Three Metro stations within walking distance. The young lady at reception was extremely helpful - nothing was too much trouble for her, including leaving our luggage in a locked room both on the day of arrival and the day of departure. The bedrooms were quite small, but okay for short stays. Everything was very clean and nicely decorated. The only negative comment would be the small breakfast room. Tables too small for 4 people, and everyone packed in so close that it was difficult to get up and move around without disturbing others. I would certainly recommend the hotel to others, and I hope to return at some future date.",
            "Booked this hotel on the internet having sought location advice from Trip Advisor. When travelling in France we always book Logis De France hotels as these have never disappointed. They are always lovely warm and friendly stopovers. This hotel is small but really comfortable with quite big rooms for Paris and a great en-suite. The staff are really friendly and will make calls for you and arrange trips. The hotel is close to a really exciting daily market and about 10/15 mins. walk of Notre Dame and the right bank. Breakfasts are great with croissants,chocolate croissants, yoghurts, cereal, cheese and crusty bread. Tea, coffee, water and pure orange juice are available along with jams. Be sure to go to Shakespeare and Co book shop on the bank of the Seine, a great experience. My children booked us a treat ride from the airport with ------------ and two lovely men, Vincent and Jimmy made our Paris experience with a night drive through Paris past all the sights. Magic.",
            "This is a small, but charming hotel in an excellent location. The rooms are small, but spotlessly clean and the reception staff are very helpful. There are very good restaurants just a short walk away on the Rue Mouffetard, and the two nearby metro stations make it an excellent base.Lack of air conditioning could be a problem in summer months, though there is a fan in the room.Having paid more for worse accommodation, I shall certainly return to this hotel.",
            "We just returned from 2 weeks in Paris and stayed at the Hotel Saint Christophe. This is a charming little hotel that is amazingly convenient and walking-distance from so many sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame, the Pantheon, Rue Mouffetard, the Seine, etc. The staff and service were fantastic and very forthcoming with any assistance we required. As for size of the room, you have to go to Paris minus the North American expectations, unless you can afford the Ritz! We would definitely stay at this hotel again! Danny & Dante Toronto, Canada",
            "We just returned from a week at the Saint Christophe, and we enjoyed it tremendously. The rooms are cosy and very well maintained. I saw some negative comments in some earlier reviews about the beds, but we throught they were excellent; I am 6' 3\" and was very comfortable in one of the twin beds. The bathrooms are very modern and are excellent as well; ours had a \"razor point\" where you can plug in a US-110 volt electric device without the need for a converter. I also saw some earlier negative comments about street noise. At least during this time of year, when we slept with the windows closed, we heard nothing. We really enjoyed the breakfasts. There is plenty served, and the convenience of having the breakfast in the hotel is terrific. We didn't make many requests of the staff, but whenever we did they were extremely pleasant and responsive. It's true, as recently noted here, that the Place Monge metro station is closed for repairs. Don't be put off by that -- the Jussieu station is only a few minutes' walk away. We loved the location. It is especially nice to be so close (two blocks) to the Jardin des Plantes. My son wanted to run every morning before breakfast, and this was an ideal place for that. For us non-runners, it was a beautiful spot for a walk among the gardens and the menagerie. The hotel is also an easy walk to the Gare d'Austerlitz, which was our departure point for a day trip to Versailles. There are a wide variety of good restaurants only two blocks away on Rue Mouffetard, and this is only a 10-15 minute walk from Notre Dame. All in all, it was a delightful hotel at a good price. I would definitely stay there again.",
            "I stayed here for a week in September 2011 with a friend, and we were not disappointed. The hotel is in a great location in the Latin Quarter, near to the Mosque, the Jardin de Plantes, and two wonderful markets. Our room was quiet, facing on to Rue de La Clef, and quite roomy. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times, and I would definitely return - if I'm ever fortunate enough to get to Paris again ...",
            "Just returned from a great few days in this wonderful city.Oct 11-16Great weather,great food,and of course a great little hotel.Catherine and moi spent five nights in the St.Christophe and we fully agree with all the positive comments made here.The hotel itself is spotlessly clean as was our room which was on the 5th floor,with a lovely view over side streets.The staff are friendly and helpful,and really made us feel welcome. A couple of tips to help you on your visit: We arrived from Dublin in CGD at 4 pm.We decided to be adventurous and take the RER to Chatalet then line 7 to Pl. Monge................................a big mistake.Chatalet is a nightmare at rush hour,even moreso with luggage!! Take a taxi its less stressful.About 40mins and 40 euro should see you to your hotel. The 47 Bus is very useful for getting downtown,it drops you back almost at the door of the hotel.Bon Voyage, we will return to the St. Christophe.",
            "We read many reviews in this website before deciding on where to stay for our first trip to Paris. We wanted somewhere comfortable and centrally located without having to spend a bomb. Saint Christophe was just that. The lady at the front desk was helpful, friendly and can communicate well in English. The room we had was clean and big enough for the two of us. There were many places to eat around the hotel and the the Metro is just less than 5 mins walk away. For people who are planning to visit in summer, you might want to know that there is no air-condition or fan in the room and it can be quite noisy in the street if you open up the windows. That said, I would still go back to Saint Christophe for its value for money.",
            "Thank you Tripadvisor reviews. We chose this little gem because of Tripadvisor and as per usual it did not disappoint us. We had a wonderful stay at Saint Christophe. All positives were echoed in most of the reviews. A good location,at a great price for Paris that was clean, with a modern bathroom, and helpful, pleasant staff. Easy to get to from CDG. Metro practically outside the door if you want to use it. We walked everywhere...it helped to wear off the croissants and wine! Elevator tiny and we would have liked to keep our key but that was not an issue. Definitely would repeat and recommend!",
            "Note: This review is actually based on our stay in October 2009. This hotel was really cute and surprised us. The rooms were much bigger then we expected for a European city hotel. We lucked out and got a corner room on the 4th floor with 2 nice big windows. Our room has a good sized, fully equipped, private bathroom. We left our key with the front desk when we went out, which I thought was odd but I guess this is customary? But the desk attendants were friendly and tried to help us although there was the language barrier. We felt very safe here and they locked the front door after a certain time so you get buzzed in by the front desk. We didn't really take advantage of the complimentary breakfast but I don't think it really offered much. We walked A LOT to get to a lot of the main tourist attractions, and we also took full advantage of the city subway system, which had a station a few blocks away. It was very easy to use and navigate! The bakery/cafe across the street was yummy and there was plenty of restaurants and shops to keep you full and busy. Message me for more info about our Paris trip!",
            "Loved our stay at Saint Christophe very comfortable.We arrived earlier so our room was not ready, we stored our luggage and went sightseeing arround .The location is great..Our room was on the 4th floor room 41,the little elevator is cozy,good view of Rue Monge our room was nice and clean.Enjoyed the breakfast room miss my baguette with jam and their coffee is very good.For places to eat lots nearby....Place contrescarpe,Rue Mouffetard and Ile Saint louis....metro stop at place Monge is just around the corner just have to remember lots of stairs at that metro station but it was okay with us....would definitely stay their again....the staff is very helpful...thanks for making our stay enjoyable....",
            "I stayed at this hotel recently for 3 nights and for a boutique hotel in Paris it is defintely one of the nicer ones I have stayed in. The hotel is in a good location (for good restaurants nearby head towards Rue Mouffetard) and the hotel is very clean with lovely furniture and tastefully decorated. While the room is small having stayed in several boutique hotels in Paris I can assure you that this is the case everywhere and I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the bathroom. The big downside for me however was the noise of the metro. I could feel the vibrations of the metro from my room and this definitley affected my ability to sleep (it runs from around 5am until well after midnight so only a 4 hour window in between!). I was on the third floor so it's not like I was close to the basement. As I mentioned previously I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Paris but have never experienced this before and for this reason I won't be returning to this hotel which is such a pity as I thought it was excellent in every other aspect.",
            "A real parisienne experience. The hotel is a beautiful building and the location perfect. We walked everywhere and the local area is a delight with many bars and FRIENDLY restaurants. We are an older couple and went to Paris to get engaged - it was all perfect and the hotel's ambience added to the experience. Highly recommended if you want a small, local hotel as opposed to a large modern one. Many thanks - we would return and recommend you to friends. Margaret and David",
            "My husband and I stayed at this hotel in June for 5 nights and I was disappointed. Very, very small room, but I guess that was to be expected. You open the door and you can touch the bed, but it was clean, as was the bathroom, with adequate closet space. The only electrical outlet was in the bathroom, and I did not like the fact that there was no peephole or a chain on the door. Tiny TV, no air, but a reasonable size fan and you could open the windows, which of course let in all the street noises. I guess because of the size of the room and the fact that my bags were kind of blocking the bed, it was not made up for 2 days. Once I squashed my bags on top of each other, the bed was made. The breakfast was sparse in choices, and after the first day we left it alone. Close to metro, other attractions and dozens of restaurants 2 blocks away, try the Tire-Bouchon restaurant, 47 rue Descartes, fabulous food.",
            "We spent a week at the hotel St. Christophe off rue Monge, and we were happy we picked this hotel, based on TripAdvisor reviews. The price of $125/night included a decent breakfast, cereal, yogurt, croisant, cheese, o.j. and tea or coffee. The mattress was nice and firm, the room completely clean, the shower had terrific water pressure and lots of very hot water. The room faced the street, yet was very quiet. The Metro stop is a half block away and makes it easy to zip around Paris. We walked from the hotel to Notre Dame, the Louvre, Luxembourg Garden and many other places. My husband got sick, and the hotel helped us get a cab to the hospital. I told them they didn't need to chage the linens that day, and they said they would do it while we were gone. They were always very helpful and pleasant. With the money you save on lodging, you can gain weight at the many fantastic restaurants around the city!",
            "We recently stayed for 4 nights at St Christophe. We had a twin room facing the street, (which was very quiet), decent sized bathroom, and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was included in the price, and was a good start to the day. The staff were great, and we liked the location. All in all, we very much enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.",
            "A good value hotel in a good area. The rooms are super tiny and the Internet rarely worked. The bathroom was comfortable other than the shower curtain being too short so water would soak the bathroom floor. Which meant we had to waste our clean towels to sop up the water daily.",
            "The best thing about this hotel is its location but that is not taking anything away from the staff, who are helpful and professional. The downside on this occasion was that the lift was out of order but I was offered another room on the second floor, instead of the sixth floor. The location, as mentioned, is great. It's a stone's throw from the metro, near a lot of great bars and restaurants and Jardin Luxembourg is around the corner. On Sundays there's even a little market where you can stock up on Camembert and French sticks for the journey back home (if you don't mind stinking out the plane/train). The rooms overall are what can be expected from a Parisian hotel in this category; a little too wobbly and wonky for comfort but perfectly agreeable for a couple of nights only.",
            "Arrived exhausted (my problem); sink not working, cleaned up in tub, informed reception (they already knew), trekked off for hours to try to get my phone fixed, came back, napped and woke at 8:00pm. Sink not working!! Went to reception \"What do you expect us to do at this time of night?\" they said very stroppily. No, we don't have any other rooms. This was the classic Parisian 'not my problem' rudeness that people complain about, but in all my trips to Paris I had never seen before. Incroyable, or whatever. Not even, Madame, I am so sorry. Could you wash in the tub, je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9 but there is nothing to be done. When I returned after dinner they did have another room. I suppose I have just got used to better customer service over the years and was utterly shocked at the brush off I got for a real issue. I am the sort who recently put up a very run down hotel in the port in La Cieba, moribund rentals here and there, tiny rooms, bumpy beds...I am not particularly fussy, but if you don't want to make the traveller welcome you should not be in the hotel trade.",
            "We have been to Paris five times and stayed in a different hotel each time. We will stay at the St Christophe again. The location is wonderful, walking distance to Notre Dame and the walking street, Rue Mouffetard. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We were very grateful for their help arranging transportation to the airport during the transportation strike. We highly recommend staying at the Hotel St Christophe",
            "My wife and i were in paris at the end of March 2010 and i can honestly say we were pleasantly surprised with Saint Christophe. Location and value for money for such a major city was exceptional. The rooms were fairly basic but were of a decent size, so i was very happy with that after i'd just stayed in one of the smallest hotel rooms i had ever seen in London. The staff were very welcoming and were always happy to help you with whatever was needed. The Metro is very close and with the transport system in Paris being so good, and easy to use you can get to all the major tourist sites in no time at all. Absolutely fell in love with the city itself, so i am certain to be heading back sometime in the near future and i have no reason to consider looking for anywhere else to stay.",
            "We had a 4 night stay at the Saint Christophe, and would heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in Paris. The area is great, not too busy or too touristy (except for Rue Mouffetard a couple of blocks away) with lots of restaurants, shops, bakeries etc. nearby, and very close to 2 metro stations. Though Place Monge station does have a lot of stairs - we managed with our 2 large suitcases, baby and pram, but was a bit of a workout, so best be prepared for this! We were pleasantly surprised with the size of our room on the third fllow - even with a cot for our 6 month old baby, we still had ample room. Free wifi was great, as was the generous breakfast in the morning, with lovely pastries and lots of coffee! The ladies who served breakfast were very friendly, and were very kind to our baby. Reception staff were also very helpful, and always had a smile for us. They spoke English perfectly as mentioned by other reviewers. A few other touches were appreciated - extra rubbish bags were provided in our room for the baby, as well as extra towels and amenities. THe hotel was definitely one of our favourites during the holiday - we felt very at home, and welcomed. Hoping to travel back one day!",
            "My three girlfriends and myself stayed at the Hotel St. Christophe in the February half-term and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. They advised us were to find lovely restaurants and we were not disappointed. The hotel rooms were very clean and comfortable and the breakfast was continental and although not a great choice was enough to set you up for the morning. The location was excellent and only ten minutes walk to Notre Dame were we boarded the Red tour bus which I pre-booked through discount website and paid \u00a320.00 each for the two days. I also pre-booked the Eiffel Tower and although we did have to wait it was not as long as the people who had not pre-booked. We visited the Musee d'Orsay and did have to wait about an hour to get in so I would advise if you know you are going to visit the museum pre-book! Being only four women we felt very safe around the hotel area and the restaurants we visited were about five minutes walk. The only negative that I could find with the hotel was that they did not have a safe in the room but they did have a system in place to look after any passports or valuables. I would highly recommend the hotel and if I visit Paris again would have no hessitation in booking this hotel.",
            "This was going to be a four star review, we loved the hotel, the room was comfortable and clean & the bathroom was good with an excellent shower. There was noise from I think the metro but nothing tragic. The location was good & there were plently of places to eat & drink within a few minutes walk. The downside was that at check in we were encouraged to book a shuttle to the airport & a pick up time was suggested (& accepted) we paid a deposit. We arrived back at the hotel ahead of the agreed time. After waiting for around 30 minutes after the shuttle was due the man on reception phoned the shuttle operators & we were informed that there has been a mistake & there would be a further delay before the shuttle would arrive but the timing could not be guaranteed. On this basis we cancelled the shuttle & used the RER / Metro to get to the airport & we made it with a few minutes to spare. This was poor and the stress this problem caused detracted from what was an enjoyable weekend. To repeat a great hotel, but avoid offers of shuttle airport transfers - I was told this was unsual - but one problem of this nature is one too many...we could have missed our flight!",
            "Let me start by saying that this hotel is in a good location (Latin Quarter) and the rooms are clean and adequate. The reason I am giving them a low rating is b/c of their bizarre and unsafe key policy. They want you to leave your room key with them everytime you step out of the hotel. And when I say leave your key with them, I do not mean behind some secure counter where only the hotel staff have access. There is an open cabinet with hooks next to (not behind) the reception desk within easy access of anybody who walks into the lobby. In fact when we first showed up there was nobody in the lobby for at least 5 minutes, plenty of time for somebody to stroll in, grab a key (b/c they know whatever key they pick, that room will be empty) and take whatever they want. For the first couple of nights we just kept the key and waked quickly out of the lobby before any staff could say anything. However on our last night in Paris as we were walking out to get some dessert the guy manning the desk (actually he was on the lobby computer which is supposed to be for guests instead of behind the reception desk) asked for our key. When we explained we didn't feel safe leaving the key he became heated and said it was hotel policy and although his english wasn't good we thought he said he would call the police on us if we didn't hand over our key. We started to fear he would lock us out if we stepped out so we had the pleasure of spending our last night in Paris trapped in our room. If you don't mind handing over security of your items to some hired help who was hogging the guest's computer (by the way they charge for wifi which is really nickel and diming guests) by all means stay here.",
            "The reviews say that the rooms are on the small size - they are, but if you are in Paris to see Paris then this is a perfect hotel. It is near the zoo/park - worth a walk through one morning. Just down the road is a little morning market and up another small road to the right (just before the hotel) is a small square with lots of bars for an evening drink. Its close to the metro and an easy 12min stroll to Notre Dame. The desk are friendly but I score service low as breakfast is pretty basic (thick black coffee and dry bread) so don't pay - simply get something from one of the many cafe's around. A great place to stay just a short metro/walk from the main tourist traps.",
            "This is a great little hotel just a few blocks from Notre Dame. The rooms are small, as everyone has mentioned, but they are clean and very comfortable. The bed linens are especially nice. The front desk was wonderful, helpful, friendly and their dinner recommendations were very good. The location is really great. You are just two blocks from Place Mufftarde, which has lots of great restaurants and pubs. There are two Metro lines within two blocks and you are only a short walk to the center of the Latin Quarter, the Louvre and Luxenbourg Gardens. The train to the airport is a short walk as well. There are great and affordable restaurants all around this location. This hotel has the largest showers we have found in Europe, a real tub! Nice towels, too. This is super little hotel in Paris. We will definitely return.",
            "I decided to stay at Saint Christophe for my first trip to Paris for 7 nights. The location is super and an easy walk to many sites and cafes. It is walking distance to the highlights of the Latin Quarter but a few blocks away from the college crowd (a good thing). The hotel is 1 block to the metro (line 7) between the North and South exits of the \"Place Monge\" stop. The rooms on the top floor might be a tad smaller then others but they have a great balcony with room for two to enjoy the sights and sounds of metro Paris. This isn't the quietest hotel I have stayed out but it is a great value. The only reason I didn't rate the hotel a 5 is that the staff while very friendly wasn't able to offer much advice on sights or suggestions. Also, free wifi in the lobby and/or rooms would have been nice but the free use of a computer in the lobby was convenient. There is an internet cafe only a block away if you need to print anything such as boarding passes. I suggest bringing your own soap and shampoo or buying it down the street.",
            "Hotel is in a good location near a metro stop and only a short five/ten minute walk to the water bus. The pantheon is also only a ten minute walk away. Plenty of bars and restaurants close by and not too badly priced Receptionist was very helpful. Rooms were clean and noise was not a problem. Breakfast was a little cramped with not enough tables for the guests however this was the only real downside. Food consisted of the usual offering of croissants and jam although cereals and fruit juice were also available. All in all I would stay here again as the location is good, the rooms comfortable and clean and the price very good for Paris.",
            "What friendly people. I met the reception staff and the breakfast staff and couldn't have asked for more helpful people. The room was spotlessly clean and the shower was the best. There were no down-sides. only plus-sides. I will most certainly be booking in again.",
            "Stayed 4 nights at hotel and recommend Hotel Saint Christophe to those traveling to Paris who are looking for a reasonable price in a great location. While room for a single person was relatively small, it was comfortable and clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Plus hotel stay included a great breakfast each morning...juice, coffee, cereal, yogurt, great croissant and other breads. The hotel, which is 6 floors, does have a lift. Best of all is the location....right in the latin quarter and a block from a metro station (Place Monge). I highly recommend this hotel.",
            "The hotel was excellent and close to the Metro Station, which allowed easy access throughout Paris and to Versailles. My wife and I spent over a week and the hotel was very comfortable and clean, the towels and hand towels were also fine. There is a 110 volt outlet in the bathroom that can be used for shaving or recharging the digital camera, as well as a built-in hair dryer. There is local nightlife 2 blocks away with many bars and restaurants that are economically priced. We walked to the Arc de Triumph in about three hours, stopping along the way for lunch and sight seeing. The staff also helped with booking shows and dinners. I highly recommend this hotel.",
            "My wife and I stayed here in early March. Very friendly staff, and the room though small was pleasant and clean. The room included a refrigerator (part with mini-bar items which we ignored) with room for your own snack or lunch supplies. This is a small hotel - about 5 rooms per floor. The elevator is small as well (2 adults and two suitcases filled it) and the elevator is up one step from the lobby. Breakfast was very nice with bread, croissants, cereal, milk, cheese, yoghurt, plus coffee/tea/hot chocolate. The staff was also very helpful in arranging a shuttle to the airport (New Shuttle was the company) for 17 euros each if two people travel together. Check out the wonderful market a block away at Place Monge (7:00 AM-about 2:00) on Weds, Fri, and Sun according to my guide book. Fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese, jams, other foods, and some crafts and jewelry. If you are traveling to or from either airport and have very little luggage you can take the RER B train directly to Luxembourg stop, about 5-6 blocks away. I did not use this station, and don't know if it has an escalator, but most Metro stations we used required using stairs. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.",
            "I booked this hotel based on reviews on trip advisor. There certianly isn't anything wrong with the hotel, it's in a great location, it's clean, breakfast was included in the rate. Rooms are quite small by american standards, but that's to be expected so. Based on all the great reviews I just expexted a little bit of a spark that wasn't there. Everything was just adequate and average, but didn't quite live up hype",
            "This hotel is in a nice, typical Parisian neighbourhood, conveniently close to the Quartier Latin and the St. Germain area, but being just slightly off the main touristic trails it allows you to absorb some of the real life of the city. The cafes and boulangeries on Rue Monge give you plenty of opportunities to eat well, sip your cafe au lait and watch Parisian life happening in front of your eyes. We stayed in a corner room, which is quite roomy by Paris standards. It was clean, light, and comfortable. The staff is very polite and helpful. The free WiFi access is a huge asset. All in all, it definitely merits its high rating on tripadvisor. On the negative side: The double bed is a bit small for two, or at least compared to what i am normally used to. The walls are thin, so we heard the baby in the next room crying from time to time, hence the lower rating for sleep quality. But I guess this is normal in a three star category in Paris. Anyways, despite these slight inconveniences, i would definitely stay there again, and would not hesitate to recommend this place to others.",
            "My husband and I returned after spending 10 nights at this hotel! The location is great, located just on the tip of the Latin Quarter. The bed was tiny, and I did have a sore back most of the trip from the mattress, which was quite worn. Our room was nice however, very clean and lots of hot water! The location was somewhat noisy, some kind of construction going on now outside the windows but that is not anyone's fault.The coffee was not very good, but across the street they make a great Coffee and the bakery is delicious! My main complaint is regarding an argument about the phone. They stated that there were no charges for using the phone with our AT&T card, yet upon check out they charged us over 80 Euro's! We are seasoned travellers and this has never happened. They refuse to take off the charges so that is a bummer.",
            "A lot of things have already been said, but I thought this was a great hotel for our first trip to Paris, although I don't have anything to compare it to. The staff was friendly and very nice. I was prepared to be staying in a closet, but I thought the rooms were a good size, I've stayed in smaller rooms in the US. The rooms were also very clean, and clean every day we stayed. The bathroom was small, but probably normal for Paris. Having the mini fridge was very handy. The location was great, being close to the Place Monge metro station. The area is also not very touristy which we enjoyed despite being tourists. We had to give our key to the staff when we left, but we never saw the front office unattended so we felt the keys were safe. The elevator was the smallest one I've ever seen, I'm a fairly big guy and we piled in with one of the cleaning ladies which was a good laugh. I would definitely stay here if we went back.",
            "After reading the reviews on this site about this hotel, i expected something better. BUT really i cannot fathom WHY anyone would call this a good hotel. 1. The room- Small ( yes i know its europe) and clean BUT there was this MUSTY smell that just seemed to persist. 2. The lack of Airconditioning - This presented and interesting paradox. You could open the rather large windows BUT you let in all the road noises and of course, everyone can see you after your shower. I am not kidding about this. The temprature in the room would soar if the windows were closed. There is a small tower fan in the room that did little. NO cieling fans. 3. Breakfast - Very functional, Orange juice, tea, cornflakes, croissants, yoghurt is what you can expect. Its not the breakfast but WHERE it was served which created the problem. The basement was HOT and small. There were 6 tables in all and at best only 13-15 could fit into it. Not something i want to look forward to in the morning. The GOOD thing was the location- its next to two metros - Place Monge and Cardinal Lemoine. Lots of small bistros nearby BUt its not value for money( in my opinion)",
            "we stayed in room 31 and it was more than adequate in fact it was much larger than expected. I suspect however that the room could be unbearable in the summer as there is no airconditioner. the hotel is in a great location with the metro less than 100' away all of the staff were helpful except for the night clerk who was a complete jerk. he was always to busy to answer questions and screwed up our taxi to the airport. not only did the taxi not show up on time, it wasn't a taxi when it did show up. it and ended up costing 65 euro which is more than a regular taxi. worst yet, when we ordered the taxi for 4:45 am so that we would get to CDG by 5:30 am (2 hours before our flight) he didn't tell us that the airport did not open until 6:00 am. we could have slept for 1/2 hour more",
            "My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and would definitely recommend it . The hotel was very clean and was just what we expected of a parisian hotel. The rooms were small but this is the norm in Paris. The bathroom was very clean and modern. Lovely to have full length windows that opened fully.All the staff we met were very friendly and the receptionist was very helpful. My husband had asked them to arranged some flowers for me which they had in the room upon our arrival,.They were beautiful and just what my husband had suggested. We had breakfast once and this was fine, all fresh and plenty. We loved the winding staircase. The location is perfect. Metro 1 minute away. Shops just around the corner, including a wonderful bakery. On Sunday we discovered a great little market in the square. Notre Dame is a lovely stroll away, 15 mins, and the park at the end of the road is lovely. It includes gardens and a menagerie. Didnt expect to see red pandas in the middle of Paris! All in all a wonderful trip helped by a great hotel.",
            "We stayed for two nights at St Christophe and it is literally 100 metres from the Metro. It is also well located in a very safe area of Paris and there are many inexpensive eateries and bars just a stones throw away from the Hotel. The reception staff were helpful and spoke fluent English which was important for us as we spoke minimal French! The rooms were smallish but i suspect this is standard for Paris. They still had everything that was needed and you can open up the windows into your room so you can look out into the street. We would highly recommend this place due to its perfect location.",
            "My moter in-law booked our rooms online without a problem. She noted that we were arriving late. Staff had no problems with our delayed arrival. The cab ride from CDG for the four of us was reasonable. Staff was incredibly nice. Tolerant of my French, but fluent in English too. Our room was on the top floor. My in-laws' room was on the fifth floor. Our bathroom was beautiful. it did not have a bathtub, but was beautifully appointed and quite large. The coffered and lower ceilings of our room made it feel a touch small for the two of us. With that said though, my in-laws room on the lower floor felt roomier and the bathtub made for an even nicer room. I would recommend a fourth or fifth floor room. Not a sixth floor room. The bedding needs to be replaced and updated as it was lackluster. The bed itself and the pillows were good though. We slept with the windows openand were quite comfortable in late September. It got noisy at various points in the evening, but that is to be expected in Paris. It didn't prevent me from sleeping. Breakfast was served in the basement and it was quite warm down there. Breakfast was functonal. Although we would stay there again, we would give a more enthusiastic review if bedding were updated and rooms were better aired out as we found all the other aspects to be agreeable.",
            "Let me start with the no so good stuff. We stayed at the St Christophe for 3 nights from the World Cup final date onward. The weather was hot (30 degrees plus) and humid. We were given a room facing the street that was hot and, once Spanish celebrations started, very noisy. We asked if other rooms were available and the hotel staff, very obligingly, moved us to an interior room on the 5th floor. End of noise. Heat, however, remained an issue. (The hotel is not air conditioned). We slept with a fan running and windows open (into an interior well between buildings.) It was still a little uncomfortable. Now for the good stuff. This is an EXCELLENTLY run hotel with lovely staff in a very convenient location, close to the botanic garden, the Metro and a moderate walk (about a flat 1km) to the Latin Quarter. The staff (esp the lovely Adelaide) met our every request pleasantly and efficiently. We're sure that, in more moderate temperatures the hotel would have been very comfortable. Breakfast was a slightly above average continental. If the hotel were to improve anything, it might be to add fruit and a wider range of pastries in this area. Rooms are a good size, beds are comfortable (remember - we experienced 2 rooms) and bathrooms are clean, a reasonable size and have good hot water pressure. When we visit Paris again (hopefully), we'll happily book the St Christophe again.",
            "The St Christophe is located about a 10-minute walk to the French Quarter and across the street from the Place Monge metro station. Our room was on the fourth floor with a view of the lively street below. The room was a decent size with a minibar and a double (not queen) bed, which we found to be a little cramped. The bathroom had a tub with the nicest shower we encountered on our trip. The area is loaded with excellent restaurants, food shops and nearby to a coin laundry which came in very handy! The desk staff was very helpful with helping us with our local transportation needs and restaurant recommendations. The breakfast was a typical Parisian continental with baked goods, cereal, yogurt and cafe au lait. A nice bonus was that the nearby metro was on the line that takes you straight to the Lourvre."

            "Just returned today from a 4 night stay in Seattle at the Four Seasons. The service is typical Four Seasons, always there when you need them, with few flaws. The only complaint is the shower water pressure. I felt it was low, but my partner thought it was perfect. The bathroom is huge, with one of the deepest tubs I've ever seen in a hotel. The bathroom mirror has a television built into it. Great idea! Lights are on dimmers in every room. The view of Puget Sound was perfect. The front desk staff addressed me by name every time I passed the desk, and always with a smile. The business center was spotlessly clean, and offered new computers and printers. We did not eat at ART, but would like to next time. The hotel location could not have been better.",
            "I stayed here in a corner Elliott Bsy Suite with my husband and my son. The hotel room was very nicely appointed, but I was not crazy about the color scheme, if I can be picky. The room was very comfortable and well-appointed, and very clean. One thing that I did not understand was why they didn't put any heating vents in the bathroom. It was a very chilly day in Seattle, and the bathroom was always very cold. Heated floors would have been a nice touch. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel.",
            "I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada which is across the boarder from Seattle however I had to stay overnight for business meetings. I would highly recommend the Four Seasons Hotel. In one word this hotel is perfection. Literally there is nothing wrong with this hotel. I am very picky about the level of service I receive in hotel and there is not one think I could complain about this hotel is the BEST hotel I have ever stayed at.",
            "We just returned from a 3 night stay over Labor Day weekend & loved this hotel. I paid for a sedan pick up throught the hotel which made it all less stressful upon arrival. One we arrived the staff was outstanding and our partial bay view room clean, bright and very comfortable. One thing to note though is if you look at the hotel images of the sound/bay view, it will look like an unobstructed. The reality is that you will see smoke stacks and a storage facility in front of the hotel, looking towards Puget Sound, plus a very busy elevated highway when looking out. Which is a shame but Seattle is a bustling big city and these things are there. The one thing I really loved about our room was the deep soaking tub. If you like taking baths versus showers, you will love it!! The other best feature about the location of the hotel is that there is an entrance to the Fish/Farmers market directly accross the street, so if it rains and the marketplace is open (9-5:30?) you can walk through it without ever getting wet. We ordered an in room breakfast our first morning and paid $88.00. Walk into the marketplace & get yourself some awesome coffee, dounuts, freshly made crepes and paying far less is my suggestion. But my ricotta pancakes and lemon curd were quite delicous!! Enjoy your stay...we certainly did and should have at $1280.00 for 3 nights!",
            "Stayed at the wonderful four seasons for 3 nights for work and sightseeing. I've stayed at many different four seasons properties across the globe and this one is better than the average four seasons. The service is great. The front desk and lobby staff are super friendly and go out of their way to helpful. They made great restaurant recommendations (metropolitan grill was my fav) and assisted us in storing/refrigerating some food we purchased at nearby Pike market. The location is great - very close to the famous pike market and acquarium (great for kids). Seattle is a terrific walking city with lots of shopping choices and we found the four seasons to be a great home base to see everything. The room was very high quality and modern. Love the in mirror tv. Always appreciate the turn down service with complimentsry bottles of water. The housekeeping staff was invisible yet they always cleaned our room whenever we left the room, which is the way it should be. Had a nice view of the water from our room. Very nice room overall. The fitness center has pretty new equipment but not much choice. Nice views of the water from the treadmill. Pool was closed, outside only and pretty small. The spa was pleasant, and massage was good like most other four seasons spas. The locker room was a bit disappointing - small with a steam room but no sauna or whirlpool. Wifi Internet worked well but was expensive. Tv choices were great - even had nfl network. Had breakfast one morning and it was uneventful as the food was very average - you're better off walking to a nearby diner. Overall I would definitely recommend the four seasons Seattle to anyone traveling to Seattle for work or fun.",
            "Everything was perfect. When we checked in the girl at the front dest caught the names of the kids and called them by name the entire time we were there. The kids got special treats which made them happy! The hotel is close to everything so you don't need a car to get around.",
            "From Start to Finish, our stay was fantastic. Every single staff member worked with a singular purpose - Provide First Class Hospitality...and they do! The rooms were spotless, and the restaurant food was delicious, beautiful and priced lower than I expected. The bar fills with locals during M-Th Happy Hour, but clears out by 8:00 leaving plenty of room for hotel guests. The infinity pool is a great way to spend an afternoon, and the staff was very attentive. The cool towels they offered were a nice treat to help beat the heat. (We happen to be there for 85 degree weather...) We will be coming back soon!",
            "We stayed here for three nights before our Alaskan cruise. The room was large and clean and very quiet. Recommend the bay view, was outstanding! The location is excellent, can walk just about anywhere, markets, piers, shopping. The staff was excellent and attentive but not overbearing. The infiniti pool with fireplace wasbeautiful place to relax. This hotel had a lot of little complimentary touches that added to the overall stay. The restaurant was excellent for food and service! Our only negatives were two: our bed size, had to book room with two doubles and when you are used to a King, it's very small, might book the King with two rollaways next time but beds were very comfortable. Second, the internet fee was per device! We all had iPads so it added up quick! Overall, stay was wonderful and can't wait to return!",
            "My wife and I were visiting Seattle and had the pleasure of staying at this incredible hotel.. The lobby was magnificent.. candles everywhere and an incredible fireplace with architecture to match! The staff were all friendly and helpful.. We stayed on the fourth floor.. not usually where we like to stay at any hotel , however the room was beautiful with all the amenities we could ever want. We loved the TV in the bathroom mirror and the shower was awesome with the dual showerheads (although the pressure was lacking)... Our room was right across from the spa, gym and pool... which was great as they always had fresh lemon water there even though it was a little too cool and rainy to use the small pool. One of the two negatives were the tiny bathroom shade, which left a half-inch on both sides, thus possibly exposing us to outside onlookers. The other issue was a major problem -- the air conditioning shut down and we had to have maintenance come at 6:30 in the morning and vacuum the water in the internal drip pan making a whole LOT of noise and totally knocking our experience down a few steps and why I gave the room only 4 stars... The hotel is only a block and a half from the famous Pike Place market and we took EVERY chance to go there and had an great time!! For anyone looking for an incredible Seattle experience, the Pike Place market is the place to go!! We loved that the hotel was so close!",
            "We have stayed in numerous hotels in downtown Seattle and have always appreciated being able to walk to nearby attractions. The Four Seasons is adjacent to Pike Place Market and it was a pleasure to sneak over for an early morning stroll through the Market prior to our conference. All aspects of our visit to the hotel were stellar. Great service, amenities and guestrooms. We would highly recommend staying here and think it is one of the highlights of our worldly travels. It is definitely would be a place to receive",
            "The Four Seasons in Seattle is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location, but what sets it apart from other hotels is the magnificent staff. The front desk is very accommodating. The concierge arranged wonderful in room massages for us and provided excellent directions to our destinations. The wait staff at the Art restaurant even helped us plan our itinerary each day and gave us valuable insights as to great spots to visit that weren't as touristy such as the Fremont Market. Everyone is extremely nice and helpful. The hotel lobby is lovely and the rooms are serene. The bathroom is huge. We had a room on a high floor facing the city and it was very quiet. The beds are comfortable. The breakfasts are wonderful. I was very impressed and would return for future visits.",
            "This is everything you expect at Four Seasons, beautiful great service and high quality. For valet parking I like that they have their own garage below the hotel rather than off site. Had a lower leve 4th floor room facing street and was happy to find hotel so well built I did not notice the street noise. The water view side does have a view of the sound but I mostly noticed the industrial buildings between the hotel and sound, perhaps better view at higher level. I am in Seattle often but only my second time here as the prices swing dramatically in this market. I tend to shop this against Hotel 1000, not quite as upscale as Four Seasons but a good barometer. When priced in mid $200's best hotel in Seattle, even if they hit you for $11 wireless.",
            "We just arrived back from a wonderful trip to Seattle at the Four Seasons, it is a beautiful hotel with a perfect location as we walked everywhere. The weather was in the 70s, no humidity and sunny everyday. We went for a romantic getaway, one night we took a cab to Canlis which I highly recommend for a special occasion dinner, it was exquisite. The staff at the Four Seasons is very warm and it has a very modern lobby, a beautiful fire place and they make you feel special as a guest and welcome you back. The bedding was lovely and the bathroom was amazing, they had a built in plasma in the bathroom mirror which was a really fun way to watch the news in the morning with a lovely soaking tub. We had a partial water view and I agree the views are a bit industrial, but besides that minor comment we loved the hotel. We took advantage of their special offer for three nights and they were very accommodating to let us check in early and two hours late. When we checked in they gave us a coupon for $25 off the spa for each of us, so we used the spa, which is lovely and get a couples massage for no extra cost, although the view was very industrial from the massage room, but besides that we really enjoyed it. They offer a beautiful relaxation room with tea, snacks and water. We took a water plane to Victoria for a day trip and I would highly recommend that experience spectacular views and it is a beautiful city!",
            "My husband and I stayed here for part of our 30th Anniversary trip; it was the best part of our vacation. From the extremely knowledgeable and courteous concierge, the restaurants, room service, everything was an experience to remember. The room had a water view and the bed was like laying on the clouds. The hotel was located across the street from an entrance to Pike Place Market and within walking distance of the major shops. I wouldn't hesitate to go back again!",
            "This was my first stay at a Four Seasons when I was on a business trip. I had high expectations which were surpassed in every way. I was in a standard room which was huge. Amazingly comfortable beds, huge bathroom with a huge deep bath and a TV in the mirror, Customr service was exceptional in every way especially in the bar where the bar staff made exceptional cocktails. The Spa and Gym were top quality and well worth the money. Highly recommended if you can get to stay here.",
            "I have stayed at this hotel several times on business (I travel to Seattle 6-10 times per year) and have never been disappointed. The staff is phenom - always friendly and helpful. The beds are extremely comfortable. The rooms are spacious. (Did I mention there is a full stall shower, a soaking tub, AND a TV in the bathroom mirror?) The location is incredible. My only complaint about this place is that I have to leave... although I suppose I could move into one of their residential units. The little touches and personable service at this hotel cannot be beat in the Seattle area.",
            "The Four Seasons Seattle is brand spanking new and was the reason we chose to drive down from Vancouver for a few days over the holidays. The hotel is perfectly located right next to the Pike Place Market with views over the water. The rooms are typical Four Seasons city hotel decor everything is perfectly in place but to be honest a wee bit boring. Common areas are lovely and the bar is a nice place to sip a cocktail and was quite buzzing. Staff were nice and attentive but not quite as polished as other properties that have been around a bit longer, to be expected given they had just opened. Would not hesitate to book here again next time we are in Seattle. One minor criticism we would have would be with housekeeping. One of the reasons we love the Four Seasons is the invisible housekeeping we have experienced. At other properties we have marveled at how every time we left the room it was miraculously made up when we returned and we never ever see a maid. At this location it seemed that we were always bumping into the housekeeping staff and the timing of the room refresh was always off, evening turndown service always came when we were in the room and we had to settle for grabbing a couple a fresh towels and a bar of soap from the maid through the doorway.",
            "My husband and I stayed at this hotel two weeks ago. We were en route to British Columbia and decided to spend 2 nights in Seattle. We were booked at another privately owned boutique hotel close by which appeared to be nice on its website but when I realized the Four Seasons was only $25 more night, I immediately canceled that reservation and booked with the Four Seasons and was very glad I did. We arrived late around 11 PM but we were still on NY time and it was 2 AM for us. We were very tired and were thrilled at how comfy the beds were and loved the delicious pizza we ordered from room service. The rooms/bathrooms were lovely but much smaller than the Four Seasons in NYC (the one in NYC is about $200 more a night also, so I guess you get what you pay for). We LOVED the tv embedded into the bathroom mirror..very nice unexpected touch. We had breakfast at ART and the lemon ricotta pancakes were to die for ( i have also had these at the NYC location but they were even better here). If you are going to Seattle and thought this hotel would be out of your price range check it out anyway. We got a great rate would definitely stay here again. The location is perfect!",
            "Very comfortable. If anything they are too nice and accommodating--if that is possible. Views of Elliot Bay, wood accents, generously sized-rooms. I was impressed. According to some of the Seattlites in my group, the restaurant and lounge, called ART, has one of Seattle's best Happy Hours. Endless exotic cheese table, Tapas Unlimited, Mini-Burgers, Proscuitto di Parma board, and Calamari was good enough to skip dinner.",
            "Excellent service nice hotel decor. If traveling with children the hotel does a great job at recognizing them. Seattle has a few great hotels but none match the level of service that the Four Seasons offers. Location by Pikes Place Market is an added bonus. When booking your room check room size because they do vary. Lobby is limited so if planning any type of business conversation meet off site there is no place to talk in private.",
            "I have been to Seattle many times and have stayed at many fine hotels however The Four Seasons Seattle trumps them all. The service by all the employees from bell staff, bar, front desk, spa, concierge desk, housekeeping, all of them are perfect professionals who aims to please all their customers. It is always worth staying at a Four Seasons Hotel anywhere in the world as they are all about first class service and making the customer feel special. Great rooms with great views of Seattle, perfect location very close to Pike's Market and shopping. Close to the convention centre for those of you staying here on business which was in my case for this trip. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience a stressfree, first class experience. Check out my profile on tripadvisor of the places I have stayed to realize that I know what I am talking about when it comes to first class hotels and restaurants.",
            "Hotel looked impressive. Swimming pool was incredibe. Room very nice... except: only one chair to sit in... very hard to have breakfast with partner (don't like eating in bed). Wireless connect wasn't working right. We had corner room and curtains would not operate correctly. Had to stand on chair and yank curtains closed. 24 hour fast ironing service (advertized heavily) was not available... turned shirts/pants in at 8pm and were not delivered back until 8am. Ordered room service for breakfast... it was late by 20 minutes. Good thing our meeting wasn't til 9! For the price of $500 + I would stay at Hotel 1000 any day.",
            "My husband and I stayed overnight on a quick trip up from Vancouver. The hotel is in a great location, only a couple of minutes walk to the Farmer's Market. We found the staff to be very friendly and efficient, especially the concierge, a lovely lass called Meaghan. As we were new to the city, she was able to suggest several places to visit and also which public transport to take. Our room was excellent with a lovely view onto the pool area. I was delighted to see they had a firepit for guests to sit by in the morning after a swim while waiting for the sun to appear. We enjoyed cocktails in the lounge but didn't get to try the restaurant, although the menu was impressive, as we were going elsewhere for dinner. We would definitely recommend the Four Seasons. Also look out for the yummy chocolate shop adjacent to the foyer",
            "We stayed here in late December. The room was immaculate and bed was amazing. The windows span the length of the floor which is nice and it offers a great view, we had windows that spanned the length (horizontal) of our room facing the mountains and sea. The bath was nice, separate toilet and bath as well as shower, lots of glass and TV in the mirror. Everyone at the hotel was great, no complaints there. The hotel is also a short walk from Pike's Place as well as some of the more notable attractions the city has to offer. There's also a staircase right next to the hotel that takes you right down to the docks. Across the street is the Seattle Art museum. Overall the hotel was perfect, clean, new, and a great place to sleep. Would come here again.",
            "We reserved & checked into a beautiful harbor view room. It was very well planned... lots of storage, the chaise positioned perfectly for enjoying the view, and a spacious bathroom. Due to a small problem with the door, we were upgraded to a 1 room suite. It was amazing... an even better view, HUGE amount of space, beautiful fireplace, extra half bathroom and dining room. Very friendly and helpful staff, always greeting us whenever we saw them. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that the Pike Street Market was so close, and that we could access it through a small mall across the street from the hotel.",
            "The location is great, the market is literally around the corner and it is close to the waterfront. Waterfront views are fantastic, and so is the pool area. The gym facility is not staffed like some other Four Seasons I have stayed at. Don't pay the ridiculous amount for breakfast at the hotel, walk to the market where you can get all kinds of choices at reasonable prices. Valet service was prompt. Had access to hotel car as well, which was very convenient. As other reviews have stated, the pool area is fantastic. Overall great place to stay.",
            "Our stay at the four seasons seattle was our first time staying here and we were not disappointed. The location was very central for shopping, visiting the waterfront and pikes place market. The hotel staff was all fantastic, we had great service at the concierge, front desk, lounge, bell desk, and restaurant. The staff was great at remembering us and greeting us warmly. The rooms were well designed and spacious, but very simple. Bathroom was large with a wonderful shower and bath area. Anything this hotel lacks they make up with the incredible staff. We did not encounter one rude staff member while we were there. Definitely would stay here again.",
            "From the moment we walked in, this hotel (and its staff) blew us away. Each member of the staff greeted us by name -- including knowing our different last names and our daughter's first name. They kept track of where we went and asked my daughter if she enjoyed it. The recommendations provided for dining and activities were top shelf. The rooms are beautiful and definitely worth mentioning, but the true standout at this property is the staff. We have stayed in numerous Four Seasons properties throughout the world (including Paris) and this is hands down the top hotel for Service. This was our third vacation in Seattle and we will never stay anywhere else.",
            "We just spent 5 nights at this hotel. The entire experience was beyond excellent! The best staff of any hotel we've stayed in. Rooms were very nice, comfortable and well appointed. And nice roomy bathroom! Can't wait to go back soon!",
            "I spent three pleasant evenings at the Four Seasons Seattle in May, 2009. I would recommend the hotel to other travelers. The hotel is a new structure, of modest height, right on Seattle\u2019s waterfront. A few of the rooms have direct waterfront views. Many other rooms (mine included) overlook the pool area and have diagonal views of the water. There are also rooms which look out over the streets that surround the hotel (I thiink I'd try to avoid those). The interior d\u00e9cor is modern (think bleached wood, and Scandinavian design). The standard rooms are of decent size, and include a built in desk with two chairs (one a high tech swivel chair with mesh back and seat) and one easy chair. The easy chair suffers (just a little) from the modern design problem \u2013 i.e., it\u2019s beautiful to look at but nowhere near as comfortable as a traditional overstuffed arm chair. The room was perfectly quiet during my stay (no noise from adjoining rooms, nor any detectable noise from the outside). The lighting in the room is good \u2013 each of the reading locations has a light source of more than ample wattage. All of the linens and bedding were of the normal high Four Seasons quality. The service was excellent. All my interactions with the front desk were handled precisely and efficiently. The concierge offered a dinner recommendation, and followed up with an inquiry about the meal. The one breakfast I ate in the restaurant was very good. This hotel lacks some of the charm and history that the Olympic Hotel provided when it was managed by Four Seasons. That said, this is a very fine hotel, and one I would be glad to visit again.",
            "My husband and I had an unexpected 24 hour layover in Seattle on our way to Cambodia. As my husband had never been to Seattle, we picked the Four Seasons for its proxemity to the waterfront and Pike's Market. The rooms were beautiful. We enjoyed the large soaking tub, the ability to watch the news in the mirror while getting dressed in the morning, and the view of the water. Just like all Four Seasons stays, this one was fantastic. The only negative could happen anywhere...I left my jewelry pouch on the made bed. It had several irreplaceable items int it. I called within 45 minutes of checking out but they didn't have any of their staff members report it.",
            "This is not a usually grandiose Four Seasons Hotel. The building outside appearance was not very attractive and at night the area was very dark. But inside the hotel, it was Four Seasons quality as usual: New modern comfortable spacious room (but the decor & furniture were not cozy) and great service. I was really impressed with their \"fibre\" high speed internet connection; it's even better than at home! Overall it's a very nice hotel.",
            "What can I say, if you've done any Four Seasons its a very plush known quantity. We always deal directly with any hotel/resort we are staying at, rather than book online, even with their own website. There is always added value going this route, whether it be a personal touch, like the child sized Four Season bathrobes and cute stuffed animal gifts laid out for the children, or even an upgrade bc you make the reservation agent laugh. Front desk service was inviting, very \"proper\", and yet not stuffy. We stayed here for the weekend after a week long rental on Whidbey Island. We could see the city for a couple of days, and ya know, stay at the Four Seasons...weekends are always cheaper. The rooms are beautifully well appointed, beds uber comfy and sheets with fairy tale softness. The bathrooms are downright interior designer porn. Nice big flatscreen, wifi (I think I paid), and groovy infinity pool and hot tub with a view. We ordered in the first night, and though the food was beautiful and delicious. However, it looked better than it tasted and for the amount we spent could have eaten at a high end restaurant. Wonder if the in house restaurant would have had a little better food, but with the kid's with us, it was the best food we were going to get. THey did have a children's menu. Anyway, after looking at the various Kimpton properties, and W, on the Trip Advisor reviews, I decided that Four Seasons was a no brainer. And we were well rewarded for staying here.",
            "Unbelieavably wonderful service. The kind where you think if care so genuinely about your stay or if they are just paid to do so. I believe they really care or they are good actors. You can stay one night but everyone including the doorman knows your name and greets you. Awesome view, awesome location right next to the museum and pike place market. I won't go into the amenities and how nice the rooms are but rest assured it's the four seasons and there are no better rooms I have stayed in even compared to st Regis and ruts carltons of the world. To top it off, their rates are very low compared to four seasons in other cities. I highly recommend it as the stay is well worth the money!",
            "Amazing service from the second you drive up. Always opening doors, calling you by name, offered me an upgraded room, fast room service, excellent food at the restaurant, beautiful views from the room, great pool area (with firepit) and great gym. really excellent brand new hotel. right down in the heart of seattle - near pike's place - minutes to belltown, minutes to the freeway to redmond, etc.",
            "This is a stellar hotel sitting right on the edge of the sound. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with excellent appointments. All just what you'd expect from a Four Seasons. The service is equally charming and attentive. This the kind of hotel that makes travelling the perfect mix of adventure and creature comforts.",
            "I lucked out with a conference rate and was quite pleased, worth the extra walk to get to the convention center. The hotel is fairly new and definitely up to 4 seasons standards, similar to the one in Denver in decor. The room was quite large with a separate bedroom separated from a large bathroom by a small hallway-- I had a city view room but could see the harbor in a reflection on the building across the street. As is typical of 4 seasons, the staff really made the experience with everyone being very helpful and friendly, including providing a town car for trips around town when it was available. The hotel is 1 block from the Pike Place Market, 7 blocks from the convention center, and 3 blocks from the Westlake station that will take you to the Space Needle.",
            "In my multiple yearly trips to Seattle over the past 15 years I always looked forward to the FS Olympic. I was bummed when it left the FS family. Great things are worth waiting for. The FS Seattle is so much better. The location at Union and 1st is perfect and close to the wharf and freeways and shopping. The staff is top notch. We had a 700am meeting across town and the restaurant staff and midnight shift room service worked together to serve us breakfast in the restaurant. The rooms have fabulous water views. The rooms are modern yet very uncomfortable and bathrooms are the spectacular (if you like bathrooms) The FS experience has retuned to Seattle better than ever and this is the best for business, family, or a city get away, You will not be dissapointed at the Four Seasons Seattle",
            "I spent one night at the Four Seasons on a business trip. We arrived before check in time. My friend's room was ready, mine was not. We decided to have lunch. It was quite a nice lunch, although the view of the Public Storage facility is not the best. During the lunch my key arrived and our bags were taken to the rooms and correctly put in each room. I had a very good room service breakfast, right on time. This has all the usual feel of a Four Serasons, including excellent service. I would happily stay there again. I had a view of the water, which is very interesting and I would recommend it. It can be so nice to just relax into a Four Seasons and know things will be done right!",
            "just completed a 4 night stay in a deluxe elliott bay suite...luxury unsurpassed, staff amazingly friendly & helpful. pool area, albeit small, decadent in its service. room service quick & efficient-person who answered the phone noticed i had a cold, sent up a complimentary cup of tea w/honey! concierge, eric loan in particular, assisted in helping us plan our trip in advance, reservations, taxis, etc...all handled w/the utmost of professionalism.",
            "The location of The Four Seasons is perfect to Pike's market. I don't think we could have gotten any closer. We actually stayed at this hotel to be close to the market. The room was beautiful and spacious. We had Mother's Day Brunch at their restraunt and it was amazing, absolutely amazing. The food presentation was beautiful and everything tasted perfect. The food service was great also. Great shopping is within walking distance, along with many restraunts. The only thing I would say that was slightly negative about this hotel, is they are not very friendly when you're looking for advice or information. They seemed to be bothered by to many questions and never engaged in offering suggestions easily. We visited Pike's market every day we were there and the market was filled with happy energy and good foods.",
            "Great hotel that is right next to Pike street market. Rooms are very comfortable. The pool/jacuzzi setting is great considering you are in a busy downtown area. Be advised that the rooms don't photograph well, the pictures posted by travelers are not that great because of the room color/decor are somewhat plain, the rooms look much better in real life than the pictures show.",
            "Just returned from 3 night stay in Seattle for work. Four Seasons was fantastic. The rooms and location (50 yards from Pike Place) were great, and the service even better. I left home in a hurry and forgot shaver, deodorant and cufflinks. The hotel had the first two up to my room in around 2 minutes, and for the cufflinks they were able to get a contact at Brooks Brothers to open the store for them at 7:30am, and they brought back a pair of exactly what I asked for, well in advance of when I needed to leave for work that morning. I will definitely be back and will try to bring the family on vacation there as well. I highly recommend it.",
            "Without realizing it we arrived at the hotel when Manchester United was staying there. After I had to be told who they were(we aren't soccer fans! )we proceeded to have a fabulous stay despite the total chaos that MU presence brought to the hotel. With hundreds of fans outside the hotel, kept behind police tape, my family and I were able to come and go without any hassle. Not even so much as being asked to show proof we were guests in order to re-enter the hotel. It's that Four Seasons magic-they had a security system in place that protected those that needed it but didn't hassle other hotel guests. The hotel rooms are beautiful. Our party had 2-one waterfront corner 1 bedroom suite and one waterfront deluxe room. The deluxe room was so spacious that I had to make sure it wasn't the suite before the kids settled into it! Location fabulous. Right across the street from the art museum, right at Pike's Market. Very close to lots of what's happening in Seattle. If you have the time arrange a tour of the city on your first day, DO IT!! The concierge set up small group van tour which was 3 hours and very interesting. Even went out to the locks and saw the boats coming through them. Also saw the \"steps\" at the locks. The fish ladder built to facilitate fish returning upstream to spawn. We spent about 1/2 hour at the locks. It was a nice break from sitting in a tour van and this part of the tour really catches the children's attention. If you're a fish lover than Seattle is the right town for you. We had some of the freshest, most creatively prepared fish on this trip. Don't miss the opportunity when in Seattle to enjoy the fish-and of course the coffee!! A coffee shop on every corner! My coffee addicted husband thought he'd died and gone to heaven! Hard not to have fun in this town and can't wait to go back again.",
            "My husband and I enjoyed the best service of any hotel in Seattle. No one would be disappointed with the ambiance, service, and amenities here. In addition, it is a mere step away from the places all visitors want to be. The location could not be better.",
            "Just spent a weekend at the Four Seasons in Seattle. The room was wonderful and we were looked after expertly by everyone at the hotel. Great location too. We enjoyed the gym and spa facilities - the steam room was amazing. Everything at the hotel was well thought out. Highly recommend to anyone thinking of visiting.",
            "I had a very good one night stay here at a hotel that truely fits in the luxury category. (Bill Gates supposedly owns one of the condos above) My room service was interesting and tasty. Everything in the room worked well and was comfortable and I really enjoyed the outdoor hot tub. Of course every little thing is very expensive but that's what you expect at a place like this. The view from the hot tub was great. My room cost $50 more for having a \"partial view\" of the sound which I took only because it was the last room available in Seattle that night. Please... Don't be silly, there was no view without getting a neck ache. This property offers everything I could think of wanting in a downtown Seattle luxury hotel. Oh yeah, the location is awesome with a great view and right by the Pike Place market and walking distance to everything downtown.",
            "It was my pleasure to stay at the Seattle Four Season's for a stay-cation with my husband. I was impressed with their offering the hotel's personal car service when I inquired about a taxi and loved the room on the pool level facing Puget Sound. We were also thrilled with the service from our server and food for breakfast at the restaurant as well.",
            "The first plus is the ease of finding the hotel. When travelling from north of the city Exit 165B and travel on Union Street until the street ends. We were greeted by a thoughtful staff and eventhough an entire European soccer club was staying at the hotel and mobs of fans littered the area around the hotel we were made to feel welcomed. We were never were bothered by the fans and the hotel was really quiet even while at full occupancy. The hotel has a modern design (no this is not the Olympia) with a fireplace going non-stop in the lobby, lovely marble bathrooms and the use of light coloured wood in rooms. I enjoyed the artwork in the rooms and public areas. The food was great. We ate breakfast in the dining room every morning and we were not disappointed. We ordered room service too and enjoyed our snacks. The pool area has been well thought out. The pool is small but freshing after a full day of shopping (The Nordstorm rack is only 2 blocks away). The unique fire pit beside the hot tub is a fun addition to the pool area but be careful in the wind (don't burn your feet)! The location of this hotel is great. It is directly across from the Seattle Art Museum. The Pike Place market is only one block away! On a nice day you can even walk to the Space Needle from the hotel. It's about 12 blocks away. I would go back in a mintue if only to use the spa area. If you are going stay in Seattle why wouldn't you stay here?",
            "I got in late on a Monday and was quickly helped by the bell man and checked in by the concierge, I went upstairs to the largest City hotel room I've ever stayed in. Everything seemed super-sized from New York or DC. The bathtub in the bathroom was large and inviting, the walk in rain shower so large! I also didn't realize how close Pike Place Market was, it was literally like a 3 minute walk up the street, so the downtown location can't be beat. The inside of the hotel was spotless, the only thing that left to be desired was the view, I had a city-view, I'm imaging the lake view was much nicer but also much more expensive. I didn't go into the pool but the pool area had a great view, there were lots of chairs and a fire in case it was cold. The only strange thing about the hotel was that one of the things it faces is a giant public storage building. We had an event and the food was fantastic, the service there was also great, everyone was just so helpful and friendly, I can't wait to go back. My one complaint was that we didn't get to stay longer.",
            "I stayed in Seattle for two nights, and this property it really is worth every penny, rooms are magnificent, very large and equipped with all modern technologies, good leisure facilities with Fitness center, Spa and outdoor pool. The location is amazing: just a block away from the Pike Market. great place to stay and discover Seattle",
            "This is unlike most Four Seasons: a smaller, boutique style with a \" Scandinavia meets Zen\" interior design. The lobby is rather dark, lit by a fire and little candles/ nightlights even in the middle of the day, which I found a bit disconcerting. Overall, I found the design effects rather bland and not very comfortable. Upstairs, the corridors are narrow and featureless - imagine a 3 star airport hotel. However service IS true FS standard and very efficient. We had drinks and snacks one evening in the ART bar, which was positively buzzing (it WAS Happy Hour) with a most convivial atmosphere. Dinner in the ART restaurant the following evening in the restaurant was more indifferent. The bedroom was fine, usual excellent bedding and linens and the bathroom lovely and spacious with a great rainhead shower; yes, the TV in the bathroom mirror is a gimmick, but we found it entertaining (never seen THAT before)! As tourists who had never previously visited Seattle, we thought the location is very good (so close to Pike Place and easy walk downtown) and I would recommend the hotel as it is a high standard. However this isn't one of the \"raves\", but probably the best Seattle has to offer?",
            "Beautiful hotel with great amenities. The room was very spacious and everything was very clean. I do wish that they would have coffee/tea available throughout the morning, was only able to get it one morning. The location was great, right across from Pike's Place Market.",
            "Warm, personable, intelligent and competent staff from the doorman to the concierge to the management. The hotel lives the philosophy of its founder, Isadore Sharp. The restaurant food and service was so good, it was almost a disappoint when we ate anywhere else in Seattle.",
            "We stayed here after returning from Orcas Island for our last day and night of vacation. We were upgraded and the room was fabulous. Service was out of this world. Stop into Fran's chocolate shop for an extra special sweet. The infinity pool is beautiful and oh so serene. Fitness center is well equipped and has a great view. Staff arrived several minutes into my workout and brought water to me on the treadmill... with a lid and straw, which just happened to fit perfectly into the cup holder... Now that's service!",
            "Property is in great location, halfway between the piers, sightseeing and shopping districts (key since it is a hilly city). Superb service and beautifully maintained property. Nice restaurant/bar, and welcoming lobby. The tv in the bathroom mirror is a cool gadget and convenient amenity. The best activity in the hotel: watch the sunset while enjoying a bottle of nice Washington Cabernet or Syrah and marveling at the Puget Sound view by the fire pit in the pool/jacuzzi area! Standard Superior Room and City-View Room are ok. Do not get a Partial Bay View Room as the part of the view that is not the bay is a less than desirable view (unappealing residential building with residents looking your way). And to look at the bay you need to strain your neck next to the window. Best choice is a Deluxe Bay-View Room or, if willing to splurge, any of the suites.",
            "I stayed here in November and it was my first trip to Seattle. I wanted to near the tourist spots and didn't want to rent a car. Well, it was a long day of walking, but I think I managed to see everything on the beaten path. We had brunch both days at Art and one lunch. The food was delicious. The hotel feels very new and modern. Nice bar scene and fireplace.",
            "Our room was beautiful, the staff was very helpful and any and all requests were cheerfully honored. We were treated to the excellence of service that one expects at a fine hotel. Every detail, every convenience at your finger tips. The location is in the heart of Pike Place Market. Within walking distance of many fine restaurants and right across the street from the SAM -- art museum. The pool was just what we needed to cool off on a hot day (100 degrees) while watching the sunset in the bay. Staff couldn't have been more helpful with dinner reservations, recommendations, etc...Prior to our stay at the Four Seasons, we had been at another hotel (Pan Pacific) and experienced such poor service fromt the staff that we moved out and up, so to speak! Well worth the move. Would go back in a heartbeat!",
            "This four season's hotel fully delivers. In addition to amazing rooms and service, we took advantage of their spa, which is probably the best in town. The facilities are perfect, the service is outstanding and the amenities are phenomenal. The food and service at Art restaurant was without fault. I highly recommend this facility.",
            "But you will pay $$$$ for the amenities that come with it. :) That's to be expected though as it's one of the nicest hotels in the city. The neighborhood, while close to tourist attractions, can be a bit dodgy at night. It's right by the water though and has really pretty views during the day. The rooms are immaculate, with lots of closet space and square footage. The bathrooms are to die for and great for couples. Probably my favorite thing about the hotel. Marble floors and tub, TV inside the mirror and rainforest shower heads. Amazing. The fitness room while small comes with nice amenities like ice-cold towels and lemon infused water. There's also an infinity pool outside if you prefer to do laps in the morning instead.",
            "the location is fabulous. just steps away from downtown and pike market. only a few minutes walk to pioneer square. the rooms are very cold and minimalist--it's way to cool to have curves and warmth. for a hotel group with the reputation of the four seasons the service level is not what i expected. i had to pry room cleaning out of the housekeeping deparrment(they said they clean rooms between 9 and 5:30). the last thing one wants after being out of a hotel room ALL DAY with the only wish to have a quick nap is to find a room that hasn't been cleaned (and it is late afternoon). perhaps with the economic downturn they have had to decrease staff and service. perhaps service depends on room level; i felt like my room didn't rate. i usually stay at the inn at market. i regret not staying there this trip.",
            "We went to the Four Season with the kids for a little Staycation in Seattle and it was wonderful. The location is fantastic, just steps away from Pike Place and the Piers. The pool was a hit with the kids, as was the brownie sundae by the pool!! Amazing place.",
            "I stayed for three nights on business. Got a corner room with two double beds. Good views on both sides. Good sized room. Fantastic bathroom. Quality fixtures. Quite air conditioning. Wonderful professional service. Nice business center where I printed my boarding pass. The hotel is within walking distance to mostly everything, or within inexpensive cab ride distance. (Seattle downtown is a really nice walking downtown so I would walk instead of catching a cab whenever possible.) Would definitely stay here again. At the end of the conference, I also got a massage at the Spa. I was settled into a room overlooking the Elliot Bay. All the facilities are top-notched. The bed was heated, the pillow was adjusted, and the room was sizable. My massage therapist was Lauren. I just have to say, her techniques are superb. She worked my kinks in silence and hit all the right spots. Would definitely come here again.",
            "Great service, location (very close to Pike Market) & the beds are always like sleeping on a cloud. I guess that's what you would expect while staying at the Four Seasons right? We have also have a 3 yr old & they were extremely accomodating with him as well.",
            "The strip joint located next door has closed. The hotel artwork is worth a re-visit. Located directly accross the street from the Seattle Art Museum. Stunning view's of the water and museum. The best and biggest tub's in town and a huge shower.",
            "My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons for three nights during our wedding weekend. We had a nice, large room with an excellent view of the water (over the viaduct and some buildings, as others have noted). The bed was nicely positioned so you could lay in bed while enjoying the views. The bathroom was great with a large soaking tub as well as a separate double headed shower. We ordered room service for breakfast all three mornings and all of the food was fabulous. (Though the coffee was a bit disappointing, as we live in Seattle and know much better coffee is to be found nearby.) We also had dinner in the restaurant, ART, one night, which was also very good. The view isn't quite as good at the restaurant because its on the first floor, but it still had a great ambiance and our food exceeded our expectations for a hotel restaurant. The day after our wedding we had absolutely heavenly massages at the spa. The massage tables are the most comfortable I've ever been on. As a honeymoon treat, they offered us complimentary chocolate covered strawberries in the relaxation room after our treatment, which added to our wonderful experience. After our massages we went out to the pool deck for a cocktail and a light lunch. The pool area is very nice, though it was overcrowded with families given that it was a nice Sunday afternoon. We got the only two loungers available, though I should note an employee helped us find them and set them up for us. All in all it was very relaxing to lounge by the pool, even with all of the kids splashing around in the pool. We were very happy we chose the Four Seasons for our wedding weekend stay - our pre-honeymoon. The staff is fabulous, the beds are heavenly, and I honestly had absolutely no complaints.",
            "First and foremost, it is important to recognize that this hotel, we learned, is a recent rebirth of the former Four Seasons Hotel which is now the Fairmont. A newly constructed building, the new Four Seasons in Seattle is a wonderful hotel in almost all respects. Location, design, staff, service, and ambiance are all Four Season level of quality. The restaurant ART and room service are impeccable and the rooms are first rate. In particular, the rooms are clean and roomy and the bedding is very comfortable, as one would expect from a hotel in the Four Seasons stable. One small criticism, probably not relevant to all guests, is the significant traffic noise that accompanies rooms that are not \"bay view.\" Finally, a word of caution to those who wish to avail themselves of cab service in the Seattle downtown area: we used cab service ten times during our almost week-long stay and found the drivers to be universally arrogant, angry, unappreciative of their clients, unethical, and just generally very unpleasant, among the most unpleasant, rude and incompetent cabbies we have ever experienced. We have been all over the free world over the last 40 years and were astonished at the lack of interest these 10 drivers exhibited in providing even a modicum of decent service. When we discussed this with the hotel staff, they reported that cab service in Seattle was among the most complained about subjects they hear about on a daily basis. Very sad indeed! It marred an otherwise very fine stay in Seattle.",
            "Great location in downtown. The staff is over the top helpful with any requests or questions. The room was spotless, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The Puget Sound views were breathtaking. The room service was always on time and ready with the morning newspaper and a big warm smile. The hotel made a few dinner reservations for us and we always got an excellent table with great wait staff. Even the front door staff is terrific; always willing to gladly open any doors for you and to get or arrange for transportation. Stay away from the hotel bar area during sunset, it gets very warm and bright and the bar maids can become a little less helpful when asked to lower the shades.",
            "My wife and I stayed two nights at the Four Seasons on our way to a two week vacation in Hawaii. We wanted to break up the long trip from Detroit to Honolulu by laying over in Seattle. The Four Seasons is in a great location downtown, near the waterfront. Every aspect of our stay was superb and it was a great start to an awesome vacation!",
            "This was my first opportunity to stay at a Four Seasons property and they definitely exceeded my expectation in every way possible. From the check-in, to bed turn down, to the food and drink in the bar and restaurant, I could not have asked for more. The Four Seasons over delivered in service each and every time I needed something, and even when I wasn't expecting it (like placing slippers next to the bed after turn down service). I will definitely be staying at this location in the future. Thank you!",
            "What a great hotel, almost made us want to move to Seattle, even put up with the long rainy season. Word of caution: the pictures posted by other people don't do the hotel justice. We almost didn't stay there because of the photos. Don't worry, the rooms are much better than they photograph. We love the 4 Seasons and we try to stay at these hotels as much as possible. This was such a pleasant stay. The Hotel is very warm despite the Modern decor. Location could not be any better. You are 1 block from Pike Market and easy to walk to many places. The Linens (if you are into high thread count and quality) were the best of any hotel we've stayed at. The windows are not as sound proof as they should be, but the noise didn't keep us up at night. Apparently Seattle is pretty tame at night. The pool setting is Magical, especially if you have kids. it isn't very big but will do. Also the pool is located in an inner courtyard (sort of) so it is protected from the wind.",
            "LOCATION- Took the Light Rail from the airport. $2.50 per person and 40 minutes to University station. Just a block from the hotel. Walked to the Pike Market every morning. LIght stroll to the pacific center- 10 minute walk. Aquarium is only 10 minute walk. The ferry to cross to Bainbridge is 20 minute walk. Everything was within 3 mile radius so that you have an option of using the complimentary house car. HOTEL - Probably the smallest Four Seasons in the US. Lobby is modern and clean but generally small. Pool and jacuzzi area also small, but beatiful view. SERVICE - As usual, FS quality. Haley at the concierge was very helpful. ART RESTAURANT- The doughnut desert was not as good as other people's review. Portions were small but still satisfying. KIDS 5 and under eat free.",
            "A beautiful hotel with wonderful staff and many personalized and added touches to our stay! Our family of 4 was treated like royalty. Both of our daughters felt special and recognized. The personalized touches to our room for our daughters 13th birthday were special and most importantly you didn't leave our the 10 year old she felt equally as wonderful. The beds were fabulous our youngest even pulled up the sheets to figure out what kind of bed she slept on. The rain shower, tv in the mirror, and huge spa tub were enjoyed by all. Most importantly the customer service was fabulous!",
            "We considered staying at a variety of hotels and almost stayed at Hotel 1000 - we're SO glad we chose the Four Seasons!!! The hotel is the ultimate in luxury and service and the location is unbeatable! We were staying there with a little baby and they made sure we were as comfortable as possible. They upgraded us to a suite to give us more room with the baby, provided a crib with blanket and toys and had all bath amenities/wipes/diaper pail for us. The rooms were understated but luxurious and comfortable and our views were fantastic of the bay. They have a great fitness center and pool and even provide diapers for little ones going in the pool. Every detail is covered.....we ate at ART for breakfast and dinner and the food was very good. It is a bit of a business scene for breakfast but nice nonetheless. The concierge was incredibly helpful and assisted in almost every aspect of our stay. We would highly recommend this Four Seasons and look forward to staying there again!",
            "Was here with family in two rooms overlooking Puget Sound - beautiful view (dont look down though as in front of the hotel is a grungy old building, but whatever...deal with it). The service was excellent - the concierge was great - getting us great tickets for a Mariners game, although that is not the hottest ticket in baseball). The concierge also hunted down a pair of swim goggles way after the pool staff had left. Went well beyond the call of duty and made one child very happy. The restaurant was fantastic for lunch - our kids had a great meal too and they did something so special for them (I wont mention, since I am not sure they want to repeat it over and over...) but the restaurant manager was a perfect gentleman, the waitress was so nice. Room service was always perfect too - no reason to leave for dinner (although it is very expensive and I am not a fan of built in service charges - let me be decide that). The salmon with Indian spices was excellent - the chowder is a meal itself. So overall - cost was high, but if that is not the issue and you want a perfect hotel located right in the action, then there is no reason to look for another hotel in Seattle.",
            "The Four Seasons Seattle is very well located, across from the Art Museum, a block from the Pike Market, and near most downtown locations of interest. The staff was extremely attentive, kind, and respectful. Views from the room are breathtaking. The hotel is modern and unlike most Four Season properties, but the rooms were quiet and peaceful. The hotel was a great choice for the end of our weeklong trip to the Pacific Northwest.",
            "I've never stayed at a Four Seasons so I was a newbie but I have never experienced that level of service anywhere! I love the location, the view, the bed, the bathroom. And the pool was great. My friend brought her three kids and we invaded the area with floaties and water wings and no one cared. They just brought us lots of water and towels and made us feel at home. I've stayed at the Fairmont also and while that was also a great place to stay, I just liked the feel of the FS a little more because of the modernity of the decor. I've made the decision that from now on, when I visit Seattle, the FS is the only place for me, expense be damned!",
            "I've statyed at the Four Seasons twice and would have rated it as excellent but on my second stay, when I visited with my wife, I booked a higher priced room which, oddly, wasn't as good as the lower category I'd had the time before. It was bigger but not really in a useful way - for example the bathtub in the smaller room was positioned so you could watch the very cool 'in mirror' TV whilst you couldn't do this in the larger room. Also the first room was nice and quiet at the end of a corridor with great views whilst the larger room was near the elevator, and had an adjoining room where the TV was clearly audible from our room - and the view wasn't as good as it had the other two sides of the hotel sticking out and getting in the way (it's sort of a 'C' shape'). Given those factors I didn't feel it was particularly great value. On the plus side the rooms are nicely furnished, the pool (and gym) have great views, food was excellent in the restaurant and service up to normal Four Seasons standards. Hotel is also well located next to Pike Place market (and near the very first Starbucks if you need a touristy fix!). Would stay again but will be more careful on room choice.",
            "The location of this hotel is great if you want to visit the waterfront and Pikes Market. The Market is just a block away, and we walked to lots of good restaurants from this location even though we had a car as well. Hotel also has car service for the guests which we used one evening and was terrific. We visited the lounge one evening and ended up in the middle of their happy hour which also features a wonderful cheese side bar with lots of great tasty fruits, nuts and breads which ended up being dinner one night.",
            "This is our third visit to 4S Seattle. We're spoiled, and you will probably see me replicating this review for any 4S property. 4S Seattle is particularly nice for an urban hotel because it is not a large property. The modern rooms are finely decorated and are exceptionally comfortable. Nice gym, but pool is a tad small for my taste [about 50 ft], since I like to swim laps. Lovely water view, even with Seattle Steam across the way, which actually adds to the appeal of the vista [think Pompidou Museum for real].",
            "Compared with other Four Seasons properties this hotel is disappointing. It has a beautiful and relaxing lobby, and very nice rooms, but other than that I was disappointed. It's in a noisy part of downtown Seattle; while you have a view of the water, the view is over some industrial buildings and an always-busy and very noisy expressway (the Alaska Way Viaduct). It is convenient to Pike Place Market, but I have hard a time imaging that the clientele that can afford this hotel is going to make more than 1 trip to the market. The really annoying thing about this hotel -- and the primary reason for my poor review -- is their terrible policy toward charging for wireless Internet service. Upon signing in and paying for an $11-day-per-day rate (crazy in and of itself), they prompt you to pay an additional $4 for \"premium\" service. If you don't pay the $4 upgrade, you get mediocre service -- not fast enough to watch simple Flash animation, for example. So Internet service equivalent to what you get in a Holiday Inn Express for *free* will cost you $15 a day. I've read in the paper that the owners of this hotel are in deep financial trouble and have refused to pay the company that built the hotel. I can only assume that they're trying to make up the difference by charging $15 for Internet service. One more thing - Fran's Chocalates (in the lobby) are great.",
            "I am a loyal Four Seasons customer and was very excited to have the chain come back to Seattle after many years of absence. Unfortunately, my first stay negated my excitement. The hotel is new and the rooms are reasonably nice and brand new, but not really up to Four Seasons standards. The furniture is light maple and the carpets are very bright. The entire place felt like it was built by high end Ikea. It doesn't look or feel luxurious. The other big problem is the location and the view. I paid extra for a waterview room, but it was dominated by a view of two big smokestacks and a construction site. Seattle has amazing water views but this hotel isn't situated in a spot that has them. In fact, it is still in a transitional neighborhood with a handful of peep shows and X rates theaters only a block away. The worst part of my stay, however, was my inability to take a normal shower. The water pressure in the shower was the lowest I've experienced in North America. I couldn't wash my hair and could barely get the soap off my body. Upon checkout I emailed the manager and he told me that the \"water pressure in my room was consistent with the hotel standard.\" I don't know what that means but it is not connsistent with any other place and certainly not a Four Seasons. Seattle has great luxury hotel choices in Hotel 1000 and the new Pan Pacific. There is no reason at all to put up with the shortcomings of this Four Seasons.",
            "My husband had a meeting in Seattle so we decided to make it a quick family get-away. This trip was for business and for pleasure combined. A friend from Seattle actually recommended the Four Seasons. The chain has been running some great deals lately; Stay longer package deals (stay 2 nights, get one in Houston/Seattle and several other cities), and we have been taking advantage! We stayed for 3 nights over a holiday weekend. So lucky to have PERFECT weather in Seattle and to take in all the great things the city has to offer. Walked and walked. Cant' think of a hotel with a better location to Pike's, etc! Very easy to get anywhere from the Four Seasons. For my taste, the decor was very comfortable, very lovely and soothing. Bathrooms were wonderfully big! They really treat families well, here - at all FS. Delivering pop corn and sodas and fresh made cookies upon check-in. Superb FS service: Late room service (although it did take a LONG time and one of my daughters feel asleep waiting for dinner to arrive) was very helpful to us. Housekeeping even located a lost earring for one of my daughters. The work out facility is really one of the better hotel fitness rooms I have used with the treadmills facing large windows with pool and water views. The pool deck was a nice surprise, got a little crowded on the warm, sunny days. Nice Spa and fire pit, also. The one downside I can think of is the staff could not seem to supply consistent information on whether food could be served pool side- it never was while we were there. The in house restaurant was OK - Four Seasons pricey, very pretty. Oh, and we got an 8am wake-up call one morning we did not request. Thank goodness it wasn't 5am! Staff was apologetic. All in all, the pluses far out weighed the minimal minuses in my opinion and I would not hesitate to stay at the FS if I return to Seattle.",
            "This is our third stay at the Four Seasons Seattle. We used to stay at the Fairmount, but it has become a bit tired, so we now prefer the FS. The one negative about the FS if you have kids is there is no indoor pool, which the Fairmount has. I like the modern, no fuss decor of the FS and the rooms are spacious with comfy reading chairs and lights. The lighting is good, which is important in the gray Seattle weather. This time I tried the spa and had a very good massage. My one disappointment with the FS is the restaurant. Breakfast is good, but lunch and dinner can be iffy. The food can be overly precious with too much emphasis on presentation and not enough on taste. If you have a child, however, you must order the \"space needle sundae\". The chef may be a dud, but the pastry chef is a genius! !",
            "We were warmly greeted at check-in and that warmth was maintained throughout our three night stay. Upon check-in we we received a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe bay view room and thoroughly enjoyed watching the ferries and cruise ships come and go and getting a glimpse of the Olympic Mountains beyond Elliot Bay. In addition, we were treated to a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries as an anniversary was being celebrated during our stay. We ate our breakfast at ART and everthing was delicious, especially the lemon ricotta pancakes. The location was convenient to everything. We walked through Pike Place Market and to Safeco Field for a Mariner's game. We aren't big shoppers but the shopping core was within a few blocks. If we ever need to stay in a hotel in Seattle again,we would definitely stay at the Four Seasons.",
            "Outstanding service, incredible amenities, and great views. Anytime you can stay at a Four Seasons, definitely do. The one in downtown Seattle is close to attractions, shopping, and outstanding restaurants. An experience that I will always hold as the baseline for hotels I stay at in the future.",
            "Only few tips : prefer seaview high floor ( noise from first road in the opposite side ) ; visit the swimming pool in the happy hour time ; walk up and down in the city to appreciate the location of this hotel . The rate is expansive ( try special offers ) but it is a very Four Seasons with comfort and perfect service .",
            "We have stayed a the Seattle Four Seasons on several occasions. Whether we are there for an evening at the Symphony, dinner in town, or to catch an early flight at SeaTac, the Four Seasons has always been a wonderful place to stay. The staff is oustanding and the valet/email/checkin process is excellent.",
            "We don't take many vacations but when we do we plan every detail. The internet pictures of the Four Seasons looked spectacular and won out over the Fairmont Olympic. We booked a two bedroom suite and couldn't wait to get to the room. What a disappointment!! Our $2100 per night view consisted of three smoke stacks billowing smoke and steam, a large storage building and an elevated nasty looking highway. Not the beautiful vision created on their homepage. The Hotel itself is ok and the service was excellent but overall not worth the expense. When I returned home I called the Four Seasons home office in Vancouver to express my dissatisfaction. No one really listened to me and the pictures on the home page are still there! I won't be coming back!! In my world it's called false representation.",
            "I am from the Seattle area, and stayed here overnight for a weekend in town to see a concert. As soon as we pulled in, we were promptly greeted and offered help with our bags, we politely declined as we only had overnight bags. Check in was fast and efficient. Before you knew it we were in our room. The room design was modern and clean. The bathroom was stunning with a very deep soaker tub and awesome shower with an overhead rain shower. One of my key criteria on rating a room is the shower and the water pressure. This one was top notch! The tv in the mirror was a nice touch which would be expected in a 5 star property. My other main criteria is the bed. This bed was uber comfy. i slept like a baby! After coming in pretty late from a concert it was nice to see the room turned down for bed, with the ice bucket filled and bottles of water on both nightstands. What a nice touch. We used the lounge prior to the concert. The cocktails are delicious if a tad pricey. But for being in a 5 star hotel I was not surprised at the prices. We also had breakfast in the hotel restaurant. The quality of food was amazing. I believe much of the produce is sourced from the nearby pike place market a major tourist draw. I would definitely recommend this place to out of town visitors and family, and would not hesitate to spend another weekend here for another special event like a concert.",
            "I am a very loyal customer to the Four Seasons Brand. I have stayed at my of the hotels all over the world and most recently the Four Seasons San Francisco and New York. Needless to say I am in love with the service and amenities that the brand offers. On a recent stay at the Four Seasons Seattle I was very disappointed. Firstly, the facilities were not of the Four Seasons Standard. The hotel seemed very dated although new. The service was not close to par with any other hotel I have stayed in. A good example is the doorman was on his cell phone while holding the door open and did not make any eye contact with me or my traveling partner as we entered the hotel. The front desk people checking us in were aloof and seemed unwelcoming when we arrived and did not warm up during our entire stay. The public restrooms next to the lobby was unclean and did not have toilet seat covers and when it was brought to the attention of the front desk, they look at us with the look as to say \"so\". Overall, I felt that I was staying at a nice Holiday Inn or a Sheraton or Hilton. The overall impression I got when leaving was that the hotel was going to benefit from the Four Seasons name alone and not do anything to uphold or enhance the standard. If I were at the hotels headquarters, I would reevaluate the general manager as the hotel can only be as good as the management deems. This is a failure for sure.",
            "This relatively new hotel is in a perfect location, about 2 blocks from Pike's Place market and the heart of touristy Seattle. Great water views, typically solid Four Seasons service with their outstanding beds make this a great downtown hotel with a FS twist. I did find some minor housekeeping shortcomings (ironing board wasn't put away after I used it, small bars of soap, clothes I left out weren't folded as they'd typically do in other FS properties) but this is still a stellar city hotel. I also had one of the best massages in my life while enjoying a little down-time here.",
            "We stayed here after a cruise and loved it. Everyone there was helpful and friendly. The hotel is newer so everything is still fresh and clean. I have a two year old and let them know when I made the reservations, if you have little ones this will be helpful for you. They set up a bed with side rails, a mini robe, and little slippers as well as a toy (which was a gift for her to keep). They also put toiletries in the bathroom for babies. The view from our room was phenomenal, the market one block away. Would definitely stay here again.",
            "As I walked past the desk moment's after arrival I looked over at the reception and there stood three agent's all with their head's down. It looked as if they might be doing their taxes? None looked up at me as I walked by. This hotel cost me $500 per night, your supposed to be ATTENTIVE!",
            "My Mother In-law purchased a room at the Four Seasons in Seattle for our Anniversary this last March. We loved the room and the location was great for walking around Pike Place Market and many restaraunts close by as well. The room was fabulous and there was even a TV IN the bathroom mirror!!! The tub was huge, easily big enough for two! They must have known it was our anniversary because within 20 minutes of checking in a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were delivered to the room! Very unexpected and wonderful!",
            "Was lucky enough to stay here for nearly two weeks and it is just the perfect place to stay. I fully agree with other reviewers - from front to back the service is top notch, no exception. Front desk, concierge, bar staff, doormen, room service, housekeeping - all worth mentioning as they were all exceptional. They really couldn't do enough! The practicalities are superb too - lovely spacious rooms, impeccably well designed and very quiet. Great bar and restaurant, well equipped gym, luxuriously decorated throughout, and the hotel is in a super location by the waterfront right smack in the centre of town. There really is no reason to stay anywhere else. Thanks to all at the hotel for a wonderful stay.",
            "I'm very lucky to be pretty well travelled and particularly experienced at American hotels! I'm a Westin devotee but hotels.com had a great deal on the Four Seasons, so we booked the first 3 nights of our honeymoon to stay there. It is quite simply one of the nices hotel rooms I've ever stayed in! The bathroom was amazing - so well designed, massive sunken bath, walk in shower, seperate toilet with it's own glass door, and a tv in the mirror! Bed was just as comfy as the wonderful westin Heavenly beds too. Loved it. Really well located for sight seeing in Seattle, and amazing fire feature in the lobby. Really welcoming too. Didn't try the food so can't comment on that but i'm sure it was great! If you're looking for a good restaurant in Seattle, try Etta's Seafood. Best food we found in town by far.",
            "I have been going to Seattle every summer for the past 15 years. No until this trip did I feel like I was staying in a place that could hold its own against the very chic hotels of NYC and LA. The hotel is very comfortable. Unlike other Four Seasons this one has a boutique feel to it. The lounge is great. There are great views of the sound with a few smoke stacks mixed in to give it a very city/industrial feel. I thought it was a very nice mix. The chairs were comfortable and the nightly happy hour with $5 food and drink specials was perfect and large. The room was nice and big. I was in a partial Bay view room which also looked down on the pool. The ferrys came in and out of port right next to the hotel so that was a nice addition to the view. The pool was the real treat. Unlike the old Four Seasons (the Olympic) This one is outdoors and gorgeous. There was a nice mix of both younger (20s and 30s) people as well as a few older couples, and the occasional child. The pool is full service with a bar on the weekends (you can have drinks all week but it takes a little longer). The view from the pool deck is perfect with almost no sign of the industrial waterfront below the hotel. All around I was expecting to hang out with friends and run around the city daily. Instead I hung out by the pool daily and enjoyed cocktails and snacks. I cant wait to go back.",
            "I took my parents here overnight in order to celebrate my Dad's 70th. What a wonderful hotel. Everything went without a hitch, including the champagne that I had pre^ordered. We had adjoining rooms and they were huge with luxurious bathrooms. We visited the lounge downstairs and our server was generous with our wine re-fills( I cannot stand being ripped off with just a sip). The only negative thing that I can say is that the water pressure is week and it doesn't heat up hot enough. My bar bill was reasonable as well. Keep up the great work Four Seasons!!! !",
            "Stayed 3 nights in early September in a harbour facing room. Fulfilled the usual high Four Seasons standard. Location is great - within walking distance of many things and easy reach of the main public transport. Best point: the pool and sunbathing area were an unexpected delight. The area is in shade until about lunchtime but then catches the sun for the rest of the day. There is drinks and food service. It's fantastic to have this facility in a city centre. Disappointing: the bar is functional but not an an interesting or welcoming space. Four Seasons can do good bars - like the one in New York - and this one needs some excitement."

Upon checking in, the front desk agent greeted us with a smile and wished us well on our visit. We were very pleased with the size of our room and our view of the ocean. Upon awakening we ate at the hotel cafe and really enjoyed our breakfast. We then walked down to the beach, which is a very short walk, to try and clear our heads and relax.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone and next time I\u2019m in Venice you can bet that I will be staying at Hotel Erwin!",
            "I stayed at this hotel with friends at the end of my travels. It was a great hotel. Admittedly the view if you looked down into the alley did not amount to much, but the view of Venice Beach was great. The room was get clean. The rooftop bar has to make the hotel perfect. We happily sat and watched the world go bar. It had great music abd excellent staff. The staff were very helpful throughout, offering us sone great restaurant recommendations. I would definitely advise asking them. We were also walking distance to the canals which are a stunning walk. A great place to stay in the middle of Venice Beach!",
            "Anticipating my first visit and overnighter to Venice Beach we chose this hotel for four adults sharing a two queen room. Prepare to experience an eclectic crowd outside the hotel. I highly recommend that you exit the hotel on foot only by day, it can be a questionable crowd at night considering there is a hostel nearby and many homeless surround the area. The hotel staff was friendly and the room was well kept. When we requested additional towels, a quick friendly response was offered. The restaurant is another story, I could not comment on the food as we seated ourselves and left after waiting 20 minutes and retrieving the menu independently after one was not offerred. Very disappointing.",
            "Stayed here for the first three nights of our two week road trip in August 2011. The hotel is located right on Venice Beach, which although I'm a fan of, it might be considered a little rough around the edges for some. Regardless you can't argue with the location, as it's right next to the beach and promenade. You are able to get beach towels for free from reception. It's worth exploring the area away from the beach such as the shops on Abbot Kinney or the Venice canals which shows there is a lot more to the area then you would first imagine. The hotel itself is modern and our room was much larger than I expected with views over the ocean as well as inland. There's free wifi and HD content on the TV's which is nice. Parking's not cheap at the hotel but it is pretty easy to park in the area if you're willing to walk for a few minutes. Just be mindful of the parking restrictions which fall on different days based on when they're cleaning the street. There's a trendy rooftop hotel bar which was really nice with some great views, as you'd imagine. The only downside is that it seemed to be a destination in itself with complete with an achingly hip crowd and door control. At times we did feel like outsiders in our own hotel. All in all, if you're planning to stay in Venice then this is definitely recommended.",
            "The only good thing about this hotel ws the friendly staff. The worst thing about the hotel were the bathroom doors. They had sliding doors which don't shut all the way so others in the room can easily see into the toilet/shower area of the bathroom. So if you like your privacy...stay away from this hotel. The t.v in my room would turn on by itself at 6:30AM every morning...we mentioned this to the front desk and the \"engineer\" said he would take a look at it but it was never resolved. Woke us up every morning and no one could explain why. My mom and sisters stayed at the suite and complained about the uncomfortable sofa bed because they could feel the springs. We stayed there for 5 nights and every single day we dreaded going back to our hotel. Like I said, the staff was nice but I would NEVER return to this hotel!",
            "While it was only a one night stay, we were thoroughly impressed with this little jewel in Venice Beach. The hotel was clean, the AC was cold, the view of the boardwalk and ocean from the small outdoor space was fantastic. As soon as we checked in we immediately felt a part of the Venice beach scene. There is a rooftop lounge called \u201cHigh\u201d that really picks up at night, but is also the best spot to watch the sunset from. You can get a reservation from through UrbanSpoon.com or calling them direct at (424) 214-1062. The Hotel Erwin is just steps from some great \u201csmall plate\u201d locally sourced food in addition to its own small restaurant. Room service for breakfast was extremely fast, accurate and tasty. Eat out on your patio and watch Venice Beach wake up!",
            "If you haven't been to Venice Beach, don't expect Santa Monica! The neighborhood is funky, not real clean and at night a little scary. But beyond that, Venice Beach is a lot of fun and this hotel was great! We arrived in the late afternoon and after checking in went right up to the rooftop bar to watch the sunset. It was freezing cold, but there were heaters and blankets - plus great drinks, friendly service and a wonderful view - although the sunset the night we were there was not too exciting. We survived the cold for one drink and a panini, but even so, this is a great place to enjoy the ocean view. Our hotel room was small, but newly decorated, very stylish and comfortable. There is a restaurant on-site that we didn't go to - we were only there one night and decided to eat in our room for dinner and then went walking along the beach towards Santa Monica in the morning and found a breakfast spot on our way back. Our room was on the side of the hotel with a decent view over the adjacent buildings to the beach. We might go more upscale on our next visit to LA and try Santa Monica - but would also consider coming back here as the location was good and that rooftop bar is calling to us......",
            "I recently stayed at the Hotel Erwin in Venice Beach California visiting a relative who had just had a baby. The GM upgraded me to a suite to honor the occasion and I must say that the combination of proximity to the beach and central Venice, the price, the decor and the friendliness of the staff make this one of the best all-around hotel experiences I have ever had. The rooftop bar HIGH was the icing on the cake. BEST views and drinks in the area and there is seriously no better place to watch the sun sink into the Pacific than there. I will be back!",
            "I loved this hotel. The service was excellent. The bed was really comfortable and I didn't hear too much from other patrons. The food and service at the restaurant was awesome. After 1 meal there I decided to have all my breakfasts and dinners there.",
            "The hotel wasn't very full and I know why, lots of construction. There was construction going on all throughout the building. My room was nice and the hotel itself seemed to be in a cool location right in Venice Beach, but the construction was hard to overlook. For the price I paid it underwhelmed ($350 for 1 night). I had a few drinks in the bar/restaurant and met a cute bartender, so that was a plus. I checked out the rooftop lounge, which had great sunset views, but I couldn't get any of the servers to even ask me for a drink order. All in all, I probably wouldn't stay here again.",
            "Great place to stay in Venice. 2 minutes to the beach, very clean and comfortable rooms. The decor is very funky and very Venice. The hotel is short walk (5-10 mins) to Abbott Kinney (the main drag in Venice with lots of cute shops and restaurants). The hotel is also about a 2 mile walk to the Santa Monica Pier (very doable- just wear sneakers!). The staff was great, very easy going, but attentive. They have parking available (valet only- $28 a day) which is very nice. If you don't mind walking a few minutes away, you can park your car on the street for free, just go down Market St. or any street near Abbott Kinney and check the parking signs, it is not tough to find! The hotel roof bar is amazing, the views are literally breathtaking! Try and stop up early evening, it gets a little trendy, so dress accordingly! Overall I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the Santa Monica/Venice area.",
            "We stayed here last summer on a whim, and loved it. We decided to bring our friends here this time, and booked on tablethotels.com, as the resort I work at uses tablet, and it is a great website. We stayed in a suite with a pull out and a fireplace, it was roomy and the decor was to our liking. The package that I booked came with a $50 credit at the restaurant. Upon check in I asked what the deal was on that, and the gentleman who helped me was unsure, and there was no record of this on our reservation, but after asking his colleague they came to the conclusion that we would eat there, and then the $50 would be taken off of our bill at check in, and there was no reason to let the restaurant know. When it came time to check out the person that was checking us out said that we should have let the restaurant know when eating about this, although we had been told differently at check in. I explained to him the situation, and then checked out. The bill that he gave me was $100 over what we had agreed to pay on tablethotels.com. When I asked the gentleman why this was, he said I would need to provide proof of our rate. I used their computer to print off the receipt from tablethotels.com which clearly had the rate at $100 less what they were charging. After about 10 minutes of debate, and me having to get a little upset, they realized that they were in the wrong, and fixed the problem. As I have worked with tablethotels.com personally before, I don't understand why they didn't have the correct rate or any information about the voucher in their records. It was frustrating at the time, but overall they corrected their wrongs, and because of the location and the rooms decor, I would definitely stay here again. I just hope that next time there is no issue with the billing.",
            "This was my second stay at the Erwin. I appreciate the location and the security in the hotel. It is at the end of the Venice strip so a quiet location at night. I love the rooftop bar/restaurant to watch the sunsets over the ocean. Rooms are OK and bathroom has little privacy with a sliding glass door, but overall a good value for Venice Beach.",
            "Stay in the heart of the Venice boardwalk. Me and my husband love it here! We try to come at least once a year! Venice is such an awesome place we love it and the hotel is the best!!!! A California must do! Doesn't get more LA than this",
            "I was looking forward to staying at this hotel, because it was the most expensive, and I thought it would be the best, but you don't always get what you pay for. A partial ocean view upgrade is not worth the dance club next door pumping bass into your room until 3 AM, as well as the view of the garbage-can alley way. The hotel is set 200 yards off the ocean, so any ocean view is partially blocked by the boardwalk, a parking lot, and building or so. If I had the opportunity to give Joie De Vivre another chance, I probably wouldn't unless it was in a different location. Bring ear plugs, and watch for the shower water's changing temperatures, poor air circulation, and thin walls.",
            "Pretty satisfied with the hotel. It is very close to ocean, the stuff is friendly, rooms are clean. I would not recommend this place for couples, the area is not very nice in the evening. Don't use their own online booking system, when I arrived they couldn't find my reservation ) Another thing I didn't like, internet is not free ( Awesome bar on the top of the hotel.",
            "We recently spent 3 nights at the Hotel Erwin and thought it was a fantastic place to stay. The location is perfect. We booked a Premier Ocean View room and was given a room on the 5th floor. Go for the ocean view rooms. It is a lot of fun to watch all the Venice Beach happenings from the balcony. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. We ate dinner at Hash and thought it was delicious. Since we stayed over a weekend we were a bit concerned about noise coming from the nightclub High. We didn't have any issues at all. Our room was very quiet. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!",
            "My friends and I stayed at the Dogtown Suite for a birthday celebration. The room is epic! It captures the essence of the location. The white walls, immense space, and high wooden roof is exactly what you'd like to expect from a beachfront abode. However this place has a great kick of style with its clearly skateboard culture inspired decorations and it's own DJ booth! If you're looking for a beach getaway or looking to live like a rock star, this room will accommodate both ranges of taste and need. The hotel itself is in a great location. Everything, and I mean everything, is within walking distance. And if you're looking for a great bar and a great place to watch the sunset, definitely just go to the rooftop bar and you're set. It's a cozy place to socialize and have fun. So cozy, they'll even provide you with blankets! I highly recommend staying here with friends or a fun romantic weekend.",
            "Hotel Erwin is the best hotel in Venice. Let's face it, Venice is very eclectic and the locals are interesting. If you are not comfortable with \"weird\" people and street performers, the city of Venice is not for you. That's the character of the city. But the hotel has nothing to do with the people of Venice. We had a great time once we moved away from the main strip. The hotel staff were friendly and provided us with great service. The restaurant at the hotel just revamped their menu so we tried a lot of the entrees. The truffle fries are good, even the pickled egg salad was good. The burger was amazing! We have stayed with Hotel Erwin every time we have come to Venice and have never been disappointed. Hi Lounge provides an exceptional view of the city and I definitely recommend going there. And I definitely recommend Hotel Erwin.",
            "If you plan to stay in Venice Beach this is the place to get a room. And make sure you pay teh extra for a sea view too.. It's well worth the extra money. If you're not staying here then pay a visit at sunset for a drink on the roof terrace.. The sunset is spectacular.",
            "Wow. I have no idea how one hotel can provide so much incompetence. Unhelpful corporate reservations staff who provide inaccurate information. Preferred guest amenities that are promised and not delivered. Best Rate Guarantee submission ignored. At check-in, receptionist informed us that rooftop bar served food until 11PM. At 10:40, we were informed that they had made a \"last call\" at 10:20 and no food was available. No solutions offered by staff whose attitude seemed to be a surfer like \"bummer, dude.\" Filthy hallways. Unvacuumed room. And--get this--a half bag of cocaine lying next to the nightstand. Seriously?!? Do I have to look in the sheet for used condoms as well?!? No Manager available at 9:30AM to address these and other issues. Chaotic, understaffed front desk. Receptionists unable to direct other guests to Malibu. Answer? Go out to Lincoln Avenue, turn left, and follow Route 1. I know that and I don't even live there! Just one comic mistake after another with no redeeming qualities at all. OK, the view from the roof is nice at night. But absolutely no reason to stay here. Have a drink at the roof top (don't plan on eating though!) and then head back to any other hotel in the greater Los Angeles area. You'll thank me for skipping the Erwin; utter Hipster Hell.",
            "I stayed at the Hotel Erwin for New Years eve 12/31 to 1/3 and can't say enough good things about this lovely hotel. Near the Venice Boardwalk with ocean view rooms, this classy place boasts a fantastic rooftop bar called High, where the beautiful people gather to watch those spectcular sunsets over the Pacific. When it gets chilly, glowing heaters and soft white blankets make an evening under the stars simply magical. A great wine list, fantastic food in the restaurant. The staff is friendly and some great deals can be found on the internet periodically. The parking prices are pretty stiff, but still overall, a wonderful place to stay when visiting the eclectic Venice area.",
            "My husband and I stay at Joie de Vivre hotels often, but this is our first time here, It has a good beach location, but the front desk crew may have some kind of plan to divert you to a lower priced room. We had reserved a premium king ocean view many months ago, but upon our arrival we were placed in a room that was obviously not a king room and not at all as shown on their internet site. I was too tired to delve into this that night, but early the next morning, I called the front desk and after an involved conversation found out that indeed we were not in a king room. We would have our reserved room by 10 am--but still by 4 pm there was no room available, At this point I told them to forget it and that I would deal with it when I got home--suddenly there was a room available! WHy we were not in this room to begin with I have no idea as these rooms were not full, Is it some money making scheme on the part of management? Plus we were right under their rooftop bar and a loud loud bass pulsed through the room from 11:30 am until 10 at night. I would try their Huntington hotel if you want to stay at the beach as their staff is much better. I saw many foreign tourists staying here and I wondered if they were getting the rooms they had paid for ....",
            "We had the most enjoyable stay at then end of our Road Trip in Hotel Erwin. We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and discovered LA from there. At check in en during the whole we were provided with perfect service from Front Desk staff, who were always happy to answer any questions and give advice about what to visit in LA. The city tour booked by the front desk was very good. The beds in the rooms are really comfortable, big and soft. We also had a room at the alley, but did not have any noise from the bar next door. Very complete and original Mini bar items. It would be nice to have some smaller bottles of liquor in the mini bar. The only thing we missed in the room is a shaving mirror. We loved the complimentary Wolfgang Puck coffee in the room!!!! It is very recommendable to have breakfast and at least one dinner at Hash. The menu is not very big, but you will always find something of your choice. All dishes have a very original touch from the Chef. Prices are very friendly! Last night we were surprised by a fire alarm at 00:30 hours. We all had to leave the room because some joker activated the alarm. This all was handled very professionally by the staff members. If we return to LA, there is no doubt about where to stay.....",
            "Have just spent 5 nights at the Erwin, excellent friendly hotel and room was spot on in all respects. Room had a lovely balcony with great sunsets each evening and views of the mountains to the north and east. Would recommend to anyone who wants to spend time exploring Venice.",
            "I have been to the Erwin 3 times during the last 2 years, at different time of the year. It's a lovely and friendly place, in the heart of Venice beach, with comfortable, moder and clean bedrooms, great and unique view and a wonderful terrass on the roof to enjoy the view on Venice or the sunset on Santa Monica with a glass of champagne or a mojito. I love it, great vibe, clean, nice people, very helpful front desk, amazing place to stay",
            "We stayed at the hotel for two nights at the tail end of a two week vacation (a Premium King). We were initially hesitant given some of the reviews, but were glad we overlooked concerns expressed by others. The hotel was clean and well maintained, the staff were attentive and sincerely interested in guests being happy, and the location (a block from Venice Beach) was perfect. We stayed on the 6th floor, facing south, toward the west end of the hall -- good view of the beach and of the sunrise. There's a rooftop bar on the seventh floor that is worth a visit (especially around sundown) and a restaurant on the first floor (Hash) where guests get 25% off -- good food and very fair prices. It is worth joining the Joie de Vivre frequent stayers program before arriving -- a complementary beverage (half bottle of wine is one option) and free wifi is provided to members. All in all, we were pleased with the property and would not hesitate to return, especially given its location at the centre of Venice Beach.",
            "Was met by courteous staff, also able to check in early. Had a partial beach view. The room was arranged with the bed and chair facing the alley. I just moved the chair to the other side of the room and all was fine. It gave me a perfect view of the ocean, beach, and board walk. I skipped housekeeping for two days. They don't change you bed, they make up your bed. Have never been in a hotel that did that, but the sheets were not dirty so I didn't mind. The refrigerator was dirty on the outside, especially the handle and the clock radio.. It appeared that those items were repurposed but wasn't cleaned. properly. A+ for the bed and pillows. I got the room at Very reasonable price so I was a happy camper..",
            "Having arrived at this hotel in the rain it did not inspire me. It is a grotty part of Venice beach and the area does not encourage people to go and mingle in the locality. The rooms were clean and we were on the 5th. floor with a side view of the beach and the room was a fair size and clean and comfortable. The views from the rooftop bar were excellent. Breakfast was not included in the cost but served in the ground floor bar and was of good quality.",
            "For my wife's birthday I surprised her with a little weekend beach getaway. We could not have been happier with the time we had at Hotel Erwin in Venice. The rooftop bar at the hotel, \"High\", is amazing. I don't think there is a better place to watch a sunset in LA. The drinks hit the spot as well. After drinks, that Friday evening happened to also be \"First Friday\" on Abbot Kinney. Hotel Erwin is in a great location to walk to the street/food truck fair as well as everything else in the Venice Beach area. It was the perfect evening. The next morning could not have worked out better as well. Our with a delicious breakfast in Barlo was followed by a walk along the famous Venice boardwalk. The hotel is not only in the perfect location for the ideal LA beach experience, but it is extremely hip and comfortable at the same time. I highly recommend it.",
            "After a business meeting I wanted a hotel on the beach for 2 days of relax. I decided to splurge and booked an ocean view room at the Erwin. It turned out I was initially given a room with a faint glimpse of the sea, but after complaining I was indeed given a room with ocean view. It turned out to be a very pleasant two-days stay. Room cleanliness could have been better, and the room was OK but nothing special -- but I decided I was willing to pay for the view. One is located at the center of the action in Venice, and beach access is, well, immediate. The roof top lounge is very pleasant, an excellent way to waste an evening in good company.",
            "Great hotel with friendly staff in a fabulous location. If you are at all precious it is probably not the place for you as at night time it is a little dark and ominous walking around but if you have a car Santa Monica is minutes away. Yes the parking is $25 a night but honestly how many hotels do not charge for parking and at least you know your car will be there the next day. The rooftop bar had stunning views although only open Thurs to Sat at the moment. Venice Beach was as vibrant and ecclectic as ever. Like I said not for the precious as you definatelly see all sorts but I loved the energy of the place. The 1 Bedrooms are spacious and had great amenities. Spring for the view rooms as it is worth it. Did not get to eat at the restaurant but the prices seemed reasonable. Would stay here again but you really need a car but that is really the case with all of L.A if you want a bit of freedom. I am a travel agent would not hesitate to recommend to the right clients. Great Value for money",
            "This hotel is very close to the beach which is its only good point as far as I'm concerned. Room rate 202 UD per night RO but upon check out noticed that the tax was charged at 14%. Views from balcony left a lot to be desired as did the unwashed glasses left in our room. Despite the web site stating that all rooms have flat screen TVs and ipod docks our room had neither. Menus postioned in tiny lobby did not display prices. No guest information in rooms and no information forthcoming from the guy at checkout who's only mission was to ask us to upgrade to a more expensive room. Only one elevator which was very busy and meant that we had to carry three heavy suitcases down the stairs for our waiting taxi. Despite filling in an online feedback form and e mailing the GM I have received no response.",
            "My boyfriend and I recently visited Venice Beach on our yearly California vacation. Last minute, we decided to go to Venice Beach. We parked the car, and started walking around looking for a hotel. The first place we saw was Hotel Erwin, right on the beach practically! We walked in and asked for the rates and availability for one night. Miguel was extremely helpful, and got us all set up in a great room with an Ocean view on the top floor with a great balcony. The room was not huge, but not small either. It was roomy enough, and the decor was very modern. We were very happy that we stayed there, and look forward to vacation next year. One other great thing about this hotel is valet. Although it is a fee, everywhere in Venice charges for parking, and the hotel had in and out privileges. They also let us get something we left out of the car at 2.00am which was very nice. The day of check out, they let us check out late, and then we were allowed to leave our car parked there for a while, while we got a quick bite to eat. All in all it was a great experience!",
            "The hotel has so many advantages over the other options in the area that it is a no contest. Best location, easy access, free parking. Very comfortable , ample, and clean rooms for it's category , good restaurant and not too expensive. But the best part is the quality of service and the knowledge the staff has about their work and of the Mayaguez area. They volunteered information that was very useful and all this with a smile. It is a comfort to notice that the hotel has more than adequate but not obtrusive security, you know there's someone watching what is happening in the property.",
            "Hotel Erwin is the hidden treasure of California. Their staff and hotel is fresh and stylish. The room we stayed at was clean and very home like. We had a view of the Pacific Ocean that was only 500 yards away. It is right in the heart of Venice Beach and is on the pulse of the culture . It's roof top bar is fun for socializing and can be romantic as you watch a California sunset on the ocean horizon. We will definitely be reserving a room there for our next visit this summer.",
            "I work in travel and have stayed at many hotels in my line of work, and I can't say enough good things about my stay at the Hotel Erwin. You can't beat the location right next to Venice Beach. Also, the rooftop bar called High, had spectacular views of the ocean and city. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Lastly, the beds are extremely comfortable and the brunch in their restaurant 'Hash' hit the spot right before spending the day walking around Venice. Two thumbs up for Hotel Erwin. Check out some of the street performers on the boardwalk in Venice. I saw a man jump over 10 other spectators! It was great.",
            "Following the glowing reviews of The Erwin, we booked the hotel on Hotwire, where it is presented as a 3.5 stars hotel in Santa Monica/Venice/Marina del Ray. When we arrived at the hotel we were offered an \"upgrade\" at a price 40% higher from our \"deluxe\" room. We asked to see both rooms only to realize that the \"deluxe\" room is a substandard room on the third floor, poorly equipped. For instance: the TV is older, smaller screen variant, the security lock on the door was broken, the sink stop was missing and the shower head hardly functional. The troubles continued with poor housekeeping that tended to show up daily around 6 PM, just as we were getting ready for dinner. Out attempts to have them come during the day were futile. Further, even with their late schedule and despite our daily tips, the work was simply sub-par, requiring complaints to the front desk and daily revisits. All in all, we were relieved to depart and glad that we didn't opt for the \"upgrade\"",
            "I stayed with my 2 young children, and the room as clean, spacious enough, and the location was fantastic - a few feet from the beach AND a great playground! There are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Staff was helpful, though since it is the beach there is a laid-back vibe. Nice views from rooftop bar. We booked a suite so we would have a kitchenette plus a little more room for the kids, which was great.",
            "We stayed at Hotel Erwin for 4 nights at the end of September and overall enjoyed our stay. We booked the Premier Ocean View King room expecting our room to face the ocean, only to find it was on the side of the building so really only Partial Views (refer photo). If you look straight out from the room you do not see the beach, only the rooftops of nearby buildings but once you get out on the balcony and look to the left, you can see the ocean and beach quite clearly. Despite this we found the price we paid to be great value as the room was very modern and new (we were on the 5th floor I think) and the bed and pillows were unbelievably comfortable! In fact this alone made staying at the Erwin worth it! The High Rooftop Lounge you must check out. We initally made the mistake of just looking at it from the lift and it doesn't look like much from there. But walk down and you'll see great cozy lounge areas and fantastic views of the ocean, with Santa Monica and the city lights in the distance. The Hash restaurant was ok, a little overpriced and limited, and the inside section doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the renovation - a bit dated I would say. The outdoor tables though are much better as long as it's a nice day out there. We had breakfast there one morning which was great. As far as the location goes it is great for the beach, it also is quite close to LAX airport without being on the flight path. But we did spend a lot of money and time on transport to Hollywood and Disneyland etc. If we came back to Venice Beach Hotel Erwin is definitely where we would stay...",
            "The incredible location is just the beginning, from the moment you enter the staff at this chic boutique hotel makes you feel at home. Super-close to the Venice Boardwalk it was easy to rent a bike and ride to Santa Monica. The Hotel Erwin is close to amazing dining in Venice, Santa Monica and Marina Del Ray. A really perfect spot to enjoy some of the best of So. California. Check-in was quick and easy and the suite I stayed in was very comfortable and well-appointed. The wet bar was complete with dishes and silverware and I loved the sunglasse honor bar offering! The pillows and bedding were incredible and made for a very good night's sleep. The large and fluffy towels were the only thing that could have lured me out of the shower. Great rain shower head and perfect water pressure. Each room has it's own balcony with seating - but for a night out the rooftop lounge, HIGH was a great place to grab handcrafted cocktail and mingle with tourists and locals alike. One one particiular evening in addition to the heaters we were offered blankets to make our expeirence more enjoyable. It seems that no attention detail was omitted at Hotel Erwin. I have found \"my\" place in Venice Beach!",
            "We booked our stay at \"The Erwin\" while staying in Las Vegas on summer vacation. Drove down on a Saturday morning and back on a Sunday night. Should mention we live in New York City. Never having been in L.A. before we had no expectations. The reservations agent was most helpful when I requested a suite with a view. He did mention it was ocean view, not ocean front. We were on the third floor, on the alley side, last room at the back. We did look onto the alleyway but could see some of he beach. While the view did not lend itself to sitting out on the balcony, it did have a certain Bohemian flavor. The room itself had a retro 70's feel with a comfortable living room and kitchen area, a separate bedroom with a nice king size bed, and a sink area outside the shower/toilet area. The colors were lively and the room had a certain charm to it. The hotel is two minutes from the Venice beachfront, which is a truly unique experience. Recalling we are from NYC, it all reminded us of Greenwich Village. While the quality of service and accomodations were above average, the whole Hotel Erwin/Venice Beach experience is a little quirky and should be approached with an open mind. We really enjoyed ourselves and wished we had a few more days. The valet was $27, but they were quick and helpful and it was very convenient. We highly recommend HASH for breakfast. The food was excellent ( oatmeal, great wheat toast, freshberries and a tasty corned beef hash) and the service friendly and helpful. We look forward to returning next summer and enjoying an ocean front room this time. Make sure you see the Snake Lady!! !",
            "I LOVE the Marina Pacific Hotel. I visit the Marina Pacific every 3 to 4 months to recharge. It is my home away from home. All my friends and family know this is \"my\" hotel. The rooms are great. The construction took awhile but was worth the wait. I'm anxious for the restaurant and room service hopefully. Everyone from the front desk to the housekeeping staff always go out of their way to make sure my stay is as wonderful as possible. It's close to the airport so a shuttle from the airport is easy and convenient. Hanging out at the Venice Beach boardwalk is fun and free entertainment just watching all the people. It's fun to sit on the balcony and watch the crowds from the comfort of your room if you feel like it. Lots of good resturants within walking distance and some even deliver. If I ever ran away from home, this is where my family would find me. :o)",
            "From the location to the decor this hotel is a little piece of hipster heaven. Lucky for us it's just what we were looking for. The room was spacious and had really cool furnishings, and the beds were comfortable. Unfortunately the bathroom left a lot to be desired. The tub was tiny and the toilet was behind a frosted glass door (zero privacy)! We tried the Hash restaurant for brunch which was quite good and relatively reasonable. The location was good in the daytime (minutes from the beach) but sketchy at night, and walkable evening food options were limited (not the fault of the hotel but something to be aware of). We got a very reasonable deal on this property through Expedia and felt that the value for what we paid was good, however if we were paying the rack rate we would likely have been disappointed. Next time we're in the area we'd probably stay in Santa Monica instead of Venice Beach.",
            "We arrived after a long drive from Vegas on our recent trip from the UK. We were given a complementary room upgrade as we are members of the Joy of Life Club and a bottle of wine in our room which is a really nice touch. We originally planned to stay for only one night before moving to the Angelino, but we liked the vibe and location of the Erwin so much we asked Eugene, on the front desk, if we could transfer our booking for the rest of our stay, before we flew back home. Eugene went above and beyond, and made a call to make the arrangements and managed to get the cancellation charge waived. Everything ran smoothly and we had confirmation e-mails in our inbox within the hour. The following morning, Miguel was on front desk duties and helped us check out and check back in, even keeping the same room and rate, so there was no impact on us at all. He also helped with directions downtown and local bike hire. These two guys are a credit to the hotel and helped make our stay at the Erwin perfect.",
            "This is a stylish, modern hotel just a block from the beach. Venice is \"quirky,\" probably not for everyone. It may have the filthiest sidewalks in the US and perhaps the largest or at least most visible homeless population. But the hotel is very classy with a good small restaurant and rooftop bar with a great view. A seven-story building is a tower in Venice, and you can see all of LA from the roof. We liked our room with an ocean view. The location is very central. It's maybe a 40 minute walk on the boardwalk to the Santa Monica Pier. An express bus from Union Station stops a block away, and it was an easy bus ride to the Getty Center. Don't be misled: L:A has good public transit. We liked the hotel and found Venice really interesting. There is a good restaurant on the boardwalk about ten minutes north: The Fig Tree.",
            "I have stayed at the Erwin a couple of times for business, and found the hotel to be quite pleasant. It is located close to the beach in \u201cdowntown\u201d Venice Beach, so expect the VB experience once you leave the hotel. On the inside the hotel is modern with spacious, nicely decorated and equipped rooms and suites. Ask for a room on the North side of the hotel and towards the beach if you prefer quiet. They have a roof-top bar and seating area, and a bar and small dining area next to the lobby. Service at check-in and check-out can be slow If you arrive by car you\u2019ll have to do street or valet parking, valet adds $27 to your bill. Try Benice next door for breakfast.",
            "I was in a laid-back mood on this vacation, so it didn't really bother me to discover....the hot water heater was out! The staff was extremely apologetic about it, had contractors in non-stop to fix it, and offered a set-aside room that did have hot running water, where guests could reserve time slots & keys to shower. I was promised a satisfactory discount upon checkout, and this was forthcoming without me having to even mention it. The location is great, decor is cute, price is affordable. Venice and Santa Monica are quite pedestrian-friendly, compared with L.A. proper; I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go (such as to a hairstylist to get a shampoo and blowout). Note: do check on the supply of caffeinated vs. decaf coffee pods before you go to sleep; our decaf was replenished every day but we had to ask for caffeinated ones.",
            "I stayed here at the beginning of October with my wife, it was the start of our honeymoon and it couldn't have got any better. The hotel is in a sweet location, mere metres from the Venice boardwalk, it's also opposite a couple of the better restaurants around Venice Beach ( notably Danny's.) The staff were attentive and really went out of their way to help you out. There was even a free breakfast for anyone and everyone on the second morning of our stay! ( Topped off with a DJ playing tunes all morning.) The room was spacious and very unique - with a massive plasma tv and a bunch of cable channels. The balcony overlooked the beach and was much utilised as we chilled out with a few gin and tonics at sunset. I took up an 'Ink & Stay' package - where as you get a hotel room ( a very spacious ocean-view 1 bedroom apartment,) and a $100 tattoo voucher to use at a neighbourhood tattoo shop ( Great artist as well - Lucky from 'Sea Of Ink' did my work and I was very impressed with it. I think they may use another tattooist as well, Graffitti artist Norm - who I believe painted the mural at the front of the lobby.) I even got a free bottle of Patron tequilla to drink the pain away. Anyway, 'Hash' the restaurant serves the best brekkie in town - everything we ate there was superb and the rooftop bar is cool and full of beautiful people. Cocktails were grand and if you're staying at the hotel I believe you get guaranteed access to the bar ( it's a hit on weekends.) I couldn't recommend this hotel enough, it's so fu$%king good. I intend to visit again next time I'm on the West Coast and I'll be recommending to any Australian that makes it know that their heading over to the States to hang out at Venice Beach.",
            "Funky bedroom styling, although ensuite in our room had not been refurbished yet so was a little at odds with the rest of the decor. Fantastic roof terrace for sundowners Only one lift, so might have to walk the stairs sometimes In walking distance of shops and bars of Abbott kiney street, so guaranteed a good night out and plenty of cool shops to potter about in. Might want to bring your skateboard for Venice beach! Only valet parking at $25 a day so may need to be creative with your parking options - can park in carpark odjacent to hotel for $8 aday until 11pm. There is also free parking on street from 6.30pm until 8am outside subway sandwiches opposite.Didn't get to eat at the hash restaurant attached to the hotel but it all looked god and was reasonable price.Would definitely stay there again, but would get a sea facing room next time",
            "Living in downtown Los Angeles, i was feeling the need to escape the heat and be near the ocean to celebrate my birthday with a few of my close girlfriends for the weekend. I couldn't have chosen a better place to do just this other than Hotel Erwin. Being familiar with the Joie De Vivre group, I knew that I would be pleased with my experience. We had a great room on the 6th floor (the very top) that opened up to a cozy balcony with a fantastic ocean view. Working in Hollywood 10 hours a day, everyday, I was well over due to for a relaxing ocean breeze, that was mine to be had only a short 20 miles away. My girlfriends joined me at the hotel to have a glass of wine at HIGH and then we ventured off to Wasabi, probably one of the best sushi joints in the area (on Abbot Kinney). I didn't want to leave so I stayed a 2nd night and then enjoyed breakfast at HASH on my way back to downtown. I look forward to my next stay at Erwin & would highly recommend the 6th floor rooms with the balcony!",
            "We were supposed to stay there for two nights but we loved the suite so much that we cancel led our other booking to stay at the Erwin for the rest of our holidays in LA. The style of the room is great, very 70's, very california, really cool.The staff is super friendly and the bar on the roof is a must go (don't forget your jumper, you will be on top of the building facing the ocean so it is always cold up there). The only thing we found a little cheap was to charge for the internet wifi but withour asking they removed it from our bill so nothing to complain about! Will definitely go back at the Erwin whenever I go back to Venice beach.",
            "Married in 2005 on the Podium on Venice Beach we return each year for our anniversery and attend the Muscle Beach tournament on Labor Day. This year will be our 6th time. We discovered the Marina Pacific (as it was then) and never looked back. The Erwin has been re-furbished and last year for our first visit we were not dissapointed. The staff excel and nothing is ever too much trouble. Food is varied and room service good. Clean and very comfortable, we are particularly fond of a long serving cleaner on the 4th floor. Straight out of the door and straight onto the Boardwalk. We hardly venture far as everything we need is within walking distance, but for the sightseers the buses are on the doorstep. See you soon Hotel Erwin. We're coming back.",
            "Although my wife and I checked in at 2AM, the room was well situated on the 6th floor, northside, with a great view of the Pacific, Venice, and all along the hills to the HOLLYWOOD sign. Having a a walk out terrace with the room was a perk. Breakfast the next morning at HASH, the inhouse restaurant was superb, and the staff seemed pleasant and geared to customer comfort. We would come back and stay again, if circumstances permitted.",
            "The only bad thing I can say is that we only stayed for one night en route to Vegas. From check in until check out everything was perfect. I have stayed before when it was a Best Western and they have made massice improvements. Loved it and will return for a longer stay.",
            "The staff is great. Friendly from the front desk to the maintenance people. If you had a question they would answer it with more than just a passing interest. We booked the hotel and they talked us in to upgrading to a balcony room overlooking the ocean which was great. We loved sitting out on the balcony and drinking a beer and toasting the sunset. The down side is there is a rooftop bar which was right over our head and the music pounded until 1 or 2 in the morning. We were on the room closest to the Ocean on the 6th floor (top) and we talked with people more towards the back (same view pretty much) and they said that they could not hear the music. I will say that we did not ask to be moved after the first day (we just stayed two days). The music did not bother us too bad, we are both pretty heavy sleepers, but I can see how it could really bother some people. We ate breakfast at the hotel and it was great. We are probably more Santa Monica people than Venice, but the staff made the stay worth while and if Venice beach is what you want, this is the place for you. Our room was very nice remodeled, not too big, but nice. Good beds, a small refrigerator and a safe in your room. The balcony with chairs was the best part of all.",
            "Stayed at the Erwin at Venice Beach for two nights with the room being great with a view over the beach. It is on the coast and not far from all of the main attractions of LA... although it is a location of its own well worth a visit. It really is the location that is the hit for those who like a stay on the fringe of life. The beach front holds one transfixed by the characters that frequent it along with their antics [don't be fooled as some of this is part of an act and some of these people are talented folk who choose this way of life] admid the tattoo parlours, outlet stores and medicinal cannabis locations. It is the later that gives this area an interesting \"breeze\" that might not be for some... as \"the breeze\" is there almost 24/7. The Hotel has a fantastic roof top bar above \"the breeze\" that has an uninterupted view to all points of the compass and a great little restaurant that is well appointted as well as serves excellent food. However, when staying here get out onto the breach front and have a meal at the \"Side Walk Cafe\" so you can be entertained by the side show... it is well worth it!",
            "if you're looking for a fun, funky, friendly and fresh place to stay in Venice Beach then Hotel Erwin is the spot. i accompanied my husband (work for him; leisure trip for me) and we stayed for 2 nights. i searched the internet for over a month looking for the perfect spot and we found it. The hotel is 1/2 block from the boardwalk--can't beat the location. The staff was friendly the minute we walked in (hello, Miguel!). The rooftop bar/restaurant at sunset--complete with heaters, couches and blankets---was so beautiful. The restaurant (LUSH) was amazing. We went to LUSH our first night and we split an entree (after having cocktails and appetizers on the rooftop)---the lasagna was so good, that we ordered another piece before finishing the first one. The room was clean--i appreciated the cotton bedding, the tile floor (hate carpet in hotels), the orchid flower, and the bathroom goodies. Seriously, we have never written a review for Trip Advisor but we just had to write one for Hotel Erwin after staying there. Things you should know: valet parking is $25 per night and the rooms on the south side would probably be preferable to those on the north side--city/beach view vs. alley view,",
            "Hotel Erwin was one of my little splurges on my last trip in SoCal...my boyfriend and I were looking forward to a boutique eclectic style experience & Hotel Erwin did not disappoint. During our stay, the hotel was undergoing some renovations however, we were not inconvenienced what so ever & the $10 restaurant vouchers in exchange for the disturbance made up for it. The service at this hotel was exceptional; Anderson the Valet was a gem. He catered to all our needs and went way beyond the duties of his job title. We also had a chance to try their new restaurant which was slightly pricey for breakfast but the choices were so interesting & yummy we didn't really care when the bill came! Another fun feature of the hotel is the rooftop deck with the cozy couches and a perfect view of Venice Beach!",
            "My wife, 10-year-old daughter, and I had a great experience staying in a suite at the Hotel Erwin. The room was great, service was excellent all-around, with special kudos to front desk person Miguel, who went out of his way to to assist us with traveling advise, recommendations, etc. The outside of the hotel was unimpressive as major renovations were being made to the exterior and it was covered with scaffolding, but the suite was delightful. You're one block from the beach. If you're looking for pure relaxation and beautiful surroundings, this is probably not where you want to stay. You're in the heart of the very lively Venice Beach neighborhood which is very active and a little scruffy, but the hotel itself was delightful. If you want to stay in Venice, this is a great place to be.",
            "My wife, new born, and I stayed in Venice beach for one night, but wish we were there longer. We reserved a one bedroom suite which was colorfully decorated and had a great view of the beach. The beds were comfortable and we wish it was colder the night we stayed, because we would have used the fireplace. We did not eat at Hash or have a drink at High, but overheard a guest raving about the food. So it must be good! Everyone was friendly and provided us with the information we needed to get around - find Starbucks, the reatuarant we were meeting friends at, and refuel are car. The bellmen were quick and friendly. I highly reccomend staying here if you are in the area.",
            "I stayed at Hotel Erwin for a weekend getaway with a girlfriend last May. We just wanted a good old Venice, beachy, fun girls' weekend out. The room started us off right - so 60's Venice! Bright colors, skateboards, butterfly chirs and a grand ocean/boardwalk view (always entertaining). We had cocktail on the Roof (High) both evenings at sunset, which was beyond compare. The staff (Erin) was SUPER helpful offering suggestions of where to have fun on Saturday - drove up the coast to Malibu after a great breakfast at Hash! Can't wait to go again! !",
            "We booked this hotel after being advised by the travel agent it's perfect for access into Hollywood etc. We advised the travel agent at the time of booking we did not want to be hiring a car and they advised this was fine. The hotel was $100 taxi ride from Hollywood/Beverly Hills and the area the hotel was situated in was not nice, and not safe for two young girls to go out in the evening. Santa Monica pier was about a mile walk away. If you're looking for a hotel which is near to the sights of Hollywood etc, then this is not the hotel for you.The hotel itself was beautiful and the rooms were very spacious, with incredibly comfy beds! We had a few nights were people were being noisy, and even attempted to bang into our door at 3am to find they had the wrong room! The restaurant was lovely, and so were the staff so all in all the hotel was great, the location was not.",
            "I have stayed at the Hotel Erwin four times over the past three years (most recently December 11). The location is great and the overall vibe of the property is cool, hip, and funky. It seems that the management believes the great location and the cool vibe is all it needs to be successful. There doesn't appear to be a guest service focus at all. The service at the front desk is painfully slow and unattentiive. As others have said, the rooms are in need of maintenance and updating. Nothing serious, they are just tired. In spite of the poor guest service and the need for room maintenance, the Hotel Erwin is a good choice if you want to stay in Venice. Just don't expect four star service and accomandations.",
            "I chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor recommendations as I was looking for something different to the standard chain hotels. The location is good (very close to the beach and a long-ish walk to Santa Monica). The hotel had an interesting retro vibe, and the roof deck is cool. The staff were friendly and helpful. My only gripe was that the 'free wi fi' is only 'free' if you join their club; which is in turn free but a pain nonetheless. Overall we had a nice stay at the hotel.",
            "Roof top bar was amazing with a beatiful view of the sunset. The bartender was very friendly and had some great recommendations of other cool places for us to visit while we were in the area. We had one rainy day while in Venice so it was great to have a suite to kick back and watch a movie in our room. The hotel gives you the option of going green and of course we did....what a great idea!! Coupons to use for dinner in the restaurant! Wonderful food (the shrimp and grits were fantastic) While eating at Barlo we checked in on \"Yelp\" and was able to recieve a free cocktail, which was awesome! The young lady at the front desk was very friendly and made the arrival and check out process very smooth. Will definitely be going back!",
            "The Hotel Erwin is a great place to stay. It is just a little let down by it's surroundings. I do admit our visit was 'out of season' April, but side streets, and general area, were a little run down. We didn't feel comfortable venturing out at night, but the Erwin has a great alternative - the roof top bar 'High'. It is very cool, and has amazing views (especially at night) across LA. The room's were good, and we had a free upgrade for one of them (for a Facebook 'like!) to a suite, really nice to have dinning table, settee, and kitchenette, in a good size room. Our breakfast in 'Eat', was ok, but was served warm, not hot. Service at the desk was great, in addition to the response's from my 'online' questions, prior to our visit. I would recommend a stay at the Erwin (for great access to Venice Beach), they do know how to look after you.",
            "The restaurant is new remodeled and the food is amazing. The atmosphere is stylish and the service was great. I'm a salmon lover and I can't say enough about how flavorful it was. My friends had the burgers and they love it. If your in the Venice area or staying at this hotel you have to check out the restaurant.",
            "I used to stay at this hotel when it was a Best Western. I have to say I preferred it then. Its now very chic and very expensive. They have taken away the inclusive breakfast, shuttle to Santa Monica and the valet parking is compulsory. It's very pretentious (stupid coffee makers) though the art on the wall remains as good as it always was. It was the only room on our 9 hotel vacation where the wi-fi was restricted to members. The room is full of things to buy and one gets the feeling that it's pay-pay-pay. The new roof terrace is great but very overpriced drinks have a compulsory 18% service charge added. We paid extra for a sea view room but it was very noisy due to the music on the roof. It can't say its a bad hotel. It isn't. But it belongs in Santa Monica - not the more relaxed Venice Beach.",
            "We had a great stay at the Erwin, and the staff really made it more enjoyable. The front desk staff was very welcoming, and very resourceful when it came to suggesting local places to visit or eat. The rooms are nicely designed and very clean - we enjoyed our room on the 6th floor facing north which gave us a great view from the balcony of the Venice Beach Boardwalk right below us. Their restaurant, Hash, had amazing food - a destination even for those not staying at the hotel. And the rooftop lounge/deck High is awesome.",
            "The Hotel Erwin lived up to every review I read, and every good thing I'd heard about it! We were given premium treatment from the moment we pulled up to the front doors, until our departure the next day. The valet service was efficient and affordable, and the staff who greeted us at our car were very polite and helpful. At the front desk we were greeted by a friendly and gregarious gentleman, who invited us to \"sing for our room\" and gave a heartfelt example of how to do so. Our room was very large, light, comfortable, and beautifully and artfully decorated. Every inch of it was designed to inspire, please and captivate. It fully captured all the spirit and energy of the beach, and was a terrific addition to our visit there. This hotel is literally in the middle of everything! We were very pleased with how easy it was to reach from the highway, and how close it was to the beach, and the famous four corners in Venice. While we didn't have the time to enjoy the pool deck, I did run up to check it out, and it was every bit as lovely as I'd heard it was! On my next visit I will be sure to take full advantage of it. Our stay was part of a very special Birthday celebration, and to this day, we talk about how well this hotel complimented our experience. I would happily plan my next trip to LA around staying at the Erwin.",
            "Spent my birthday weekend at Erwin. They made me feel like a rock star! Everyone from housekeeping to management goes out of their way to make sure my stay is always great. They are helpful, will give suggestions on places to go and what to see. If you have any questions or needs, all you have to do is ask...if they don't ask you first.",
            "I stayed here for my honeymoon in October 2008 for 3 days. We were given a room on the top floor, which is their newly remodeled floor. When we checked in, the front desk clerk was not polite, we were treated like a lower class that some how got on the upper floor. We were given a room between two rooms having construction done. So we were woken up each morning at about *:30 am or so, by loud voices, hammering, and music. The last night there, I was bitten several times by something in the bed. When I told the front desk at breakfast, they told me it was something probably from the beach. They then said they were going then to check our room. When we got up there nothing looked like it had been moved or disturbed. We decided to check out not long after that. When I asked to speak to the manager, I was told he was not available, but that he would be calling me in the next 24 hours. Needless to say I never heard anything. I tried calling the hotel, sending an email, still never heard anything. Only after I complained to Best Western directly, did I get told that the hotel claimed they had fixed everything with me already. Shortly after I recieved a generic hotel apology. To top it off, we had to pay an extra $15.00 plus tax per a night for parking.",
            "this review is for a deluxe king bed room only. other rooms may vary. valet parking only. for $28/night. you can't access your stuff in the vehicle once it's parked. cheaply built. un-tasteful art. but drug addicts or underground punk band members might like it. un-family friendly. not satisfied at all aside from the fact that you can walk to the beach. the deluxe room doesnt have a microwave. i have a baby that feeds thrice at night. theyre asking for $60 for rm upgrade w/ microwave. cant provide a microwave for a single night. no refrigerator. they only have the chiller. a very small one at that. i want to stock some ice cream in the ref for the children cause it's hot. but not possible in this deluxe room. there's no sense of elegance inside and out at all.",
            "We stayed at Hotel Erwin for one night and enjoyed our stay very much. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view suite and the room was clean and comfortable. Pros - location (just a block walk to the beach!) - service (everyone was friendly and went out of their way to help you) - managers reception (free wine/beer for an hour while getting the chance to talk to staff/get recommendations for local sites) - valet (fast and friendly) - decor (artsy and fun) - rooftop bar (amazing view) Con (just one!) - slooooow elevator. There is only one for guests and it would take several minutes each time we wanted to use it. May not sound like a lot, but when you are just standing there waiting it seems like forever. Also, I have to disagree with anyone else who has commented about the lack of restaurants or nightlife. We saw 5-6 places to eat within a few blocks and ended up at a great place called Bindi BBQ. You bring your own liquor and the food is great. We were able to bar hop to a few places from there. Granted they aren\u2019t all right next door (although there is a great bar next to Bindi BBQ/a block from the hotel where we played pool), they are close enough to walk. So it is an option for those who want to go out at night.",
            "I had the distinct pleasure of staying at the Hotel Erwin over Christmas vacation. The service was wonderful. Each member of the staff was friendly and attentive. The beds were comfy, and the view of the beach is ever so inviting. For a more panoramic view of Venice, you can go to the roof top bar and enjoy the sea air. The food at Hash, the restaurant just off of the lobby, was fabulous for breakfast. I suggest the corned beef and hash. It is not from a can, it is in the spirit of the recipe, using actual corned beef and potatoes. I also had a chai latte, which was huge and very refreshing. Will, who works at Hash, sat us and gave us excellent service. He also brought us breakfast via room service the next day, and I have to tell you, his service was just as incredible. If you ever find yourself in Venice and need a place to stay, check it out!",
            "I live in San Diego and work throughout the state along with other states in the nation. Have been working and traveling for 8 years of my life and stayed in some nice spots. Hotel Erwin however was one of the nicest and cleanest places I have been in a long time. The room was clean and retrofitted with all the right amenities. The staff was super signed me up for Joy Luck club at the front desk and provide us with super service on the rooftop lounge. The location is ideal in the heart of Veince Beach, CA. A rooftop lounge that overlooks the beach and ocean! As I said I live in CA and I felt as if I were on vacation up there. Perfect spot to bring clients/customers in LA to relax and enjoy the weather above all the crazies below. If you have people from out of state this is the place to take them!!! Food, Drinks and best spot in town to people watch not to mention night life around the hotel all with in walking distance. Breakfast at Hash was super! All in all a perfect stop on my business travels and one that I will come back too. I am now planning my travels around JDV Hotels locations throughout the State!",
            "The staff was very professional, kind and courteous and everyone seemed to be genuinely happy. The room that I stayed in was absolutely amazing. The Hotel is classy and has a rooftop bar. Couldn't make it up there during their hours but appeared to be cool. The location is unbeatable - less than a block away from Venice Beach - and the balcony had a great view of the beach (it helped that the weather was great). While the room wasn't ready for an early check-in, there was maybe a ten minute wait (that was spent walking to the beach) and it was all ready. I highly recommend checking it out. Even if it is to go to the rooftop bar for a drink and a great view.",
            "A friend and I were driving from Vegas to San Diego last week and made a last minute decision to stop off in LA for a night, and found a cheap room at the Erwin via ebookers.com. We read the reviews on Tripadvisor, but you can never be totally sure... However, they are totally justified. Amazing hotel! Srsly cool. We had a kitchen and balcony and partial ocean view. The room was great and actually looked nicer than the photos - funky decor, perfectly clean, cool neon bathrobes, valet parking... TV, nice bathroom... The staff were really helpful, the location is cool, right on the beach, and 10 mins walk from Abbot Kinney (great coffee shops, boutiques and restaurants). I would totally stay there again and have already recommended it to friends.",
            "We stayed at the Erwin for three nights as part of a longer trip to California. On arrival the valet parking was efficient and reception staff were friendly. However, once we saw our room - small, no safe, very old fashioned bathroom, view on to a busy road - we were surprised, given the pictures on the website. The staff were helpful and moved us to a much larger room with a safe and more modern bathroom. However, we then found that building work was taking place directly under the room, which started at 8.30am on each of the three mornings. There was also a lift shaft in the room, which we assume took snacks up to the bar from the kitchen - this rattled away until about 10.30pm. In between this, the road outside was very noisy with deliveries being made in the side alley at 4.30am one morning! The location of the hotel is very good for Venice Beach but you can't actually get into the hotel from the beach, you go round the front which is not the most picturesque to say the least. There is a little patio to eat/drink but you are basically sitting on a main road so we ate in the restaurant one evening - we were the only guests and one of the five main courses was unavailable. They were upgrading the restaurant so this may have improved now. The roof top bar has impressive views. However, you need to book a table since when we went up (on a Tuesday night) it was completely full and we couldn't sit down - although locals seemed to be squeezed in! The hotel were apologetic about the noise and did give us a refund on our valet parking, which we appreciated. However, we'd have preferred a hotel where we could get a nice meal and a good night sleep!",
            "Quite a funky hotel to stay in,we were upgraded to a suite which has a kitchen in it which gave extra space.The highlight was the rooftop lounge which has 360 views over Los Angeles a brilliant spot to sit and watch the amazing Californian sunsets from while drinking a watermelon margarita.The hotel staff were so helpful especially Eugene at the desk and Chip .I wish that there had been more areas to sit inside the hotel,the bar/restaurant was small,and I was not very keen on the area,but a very popular hotel not maybe suitable for families with children",
            "I stayed here with our two boys - 7 and 9. They loved the lollipops at the front desk, the cool one bedroom suite that we were upgraded to, the food at Hash, the view of the Hollywood sign at High, the cool location right by Venice Beach. I would definitely stay here again.",
            "My Husband and I stayed at Hotel Erwin for one night. I took part in their \"Ink N Wink\" package! The tat came out better than I could have ever imagined. I got a a pretty large one I might add so it took longer than expected. Hotel was very understanding and allowed us to have extended chack out. The front desk concierge-Migel I believe his name was had a very welcoming smile and was very attentive to all requests. The room was great.We had a one bedroom suite. The balcony over looking the boardwalk was amazing. My only gripe was the bathroom, very small although nicly tiled. Fireplace was very easy to operate. They also have a great goody box in the kitchette that had interesting products you don't see in many places. I work in the hotel busniess and have never given a property five stars-but Erwin has one me over! The customer service was the best that I have seen in many years of traveling.Thank you Erwin for a truly memorable stay-I'm not just saying that because I got inked!-)",
            "Hotel has great restaurant and rooftop bar which attracts visitors from afar. You can see for miles and great for sunsets. Only thing for us which was strange was the room decor but this did not detract from our stay and maybe fits the theme of Venice Beach as it is a weird experience overall. We had a great stay and reception staff were great and very helpful if you needed anything. Very interesting visit and everyone should have a couple of nights here just to people watch. Beachside restaurants great and very good value.",
            "We stayed at Hotel Erwin for a weekend getaway and it was a much needed break. I loved the fact that we could watch the free entertainment on Venice Beach, but when we neeed to escape the madness, Hotel Erwin was right there. You can't beat the location and our view of the ocean was amazing. The beds were super comfortable too! I highly suggest the rooftop lounge because they have an amazing view of the Venice Beach, and the drinks were great. Pricy, but well worth it. The staff were friendly and accomodating. I would definitely come back to this place..",
            "I stayed with the Erwin over the weekend and had a great stay! The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly and the room itself was fresh and comfortable. I work in the hotel industry and have stayed at a lot of hotels. I give the Erwin two thumbs up. The bed at the Erwin was comfortable, which ranks high on my requirements given my propensity for back problems. You can't beat the location and if you've got a little extra to spend then I highly recommend getting a room with a view and on the 6th floor. The 6th floor has balconies, so you can order room service and have breakfast outside looking at the beach. There is a rennovation taking place, but it didn't disrupt my stay. Asdies from some scaffolding outside, I didn't notice it. There aren't many restaurants off the boardwalk in Venice, so make sure you make a reservation at High (rooftop bar) or the . It has panorama views of the beach and good food/drink. It's got heat lamps too, so whether it's a sunny day or you want to kick back at night...High is the place to be. Also, Barlo, the restaurant off the lobby, has a great breakfast. If you've never stayed at a Joie de Vivre hotel, it's worth checking one out. They all have charm, good quality of the rooms and great service.",
            "We stayed in the Dog Town Suite and it was amazing!!! Amazing view and great service!! High Bar was awesome. The service was great and they even had blankets for you if you got too cold! I an recommending this place to everyone I know! Can't beat the location of this hotel... Just steps from the beach.",
            "From the first moment we arrived to the moment we left, the staff made every effort to create a calm, welcoming atmosphere at Hotel Erwin. The Hash Restaurant and the High Lounge are a surprise of veritable delights making it difficult to choose in what to indulge.",
            "Great hotel. Great position on Venice, rooms are large and spacious, shower is excellent, beds are super comfortable and they have a nice feel to them generally. The staff are friendly and wonderful and nothing is too much trouble. Miguel, Eugene and Rich (the night mananger) are all very much integral to the experience, as they go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable. Indeed, I have had to deal with the General Manager Benjamin on another matter and he also is lovely and courteous. YOu are made to feel truly welcome. In my view, this is a vastly different experience to other hotels in the area. High, the rooftop bar at the Erwin (with tapas style food) is AWESOME, great view, fantastic Argentinian beef tacos (a must) and great ambience. I made the mistake of staying at the Bayside Hotel (what turned out to be a $150 a night fleabag motel) on a recent 3 day trip to LA, and in desperation called the Erwin and they squeezed me in at late notice and even called a cab to come and pick me up from the Bayside. Hotel Erwin - all the way.",
            "I really liked the Erwin. It's a well designed and clean hotel in the heart of Venice beach. Amazing views from the rooftop bar. I had a premier ocean view king on the top (6th) floor that's on the side of the building. The room itself was very spacious and had a comfortable bed. There is a small balcony, but there's only a small glass divider between your neighbor's balcony. Nice views though. I would advise against staying on the 6th floor if you are noise sensitive, as you can hear the music coming from the roof deck. It's actually amazing how well they've sound insulated the room, but you can still hear the muffled booming. The music stopped around 11pm so it didn't really bother me. All in all a good experience.",
            "Went to LA for business and stayed at the Hotel Erwin in Venice Beach for a change of pace from the hotels near the airport. Turned out to be a great move. The hotel was right near the beach so I was able to go for a run in a scenic setting as opposed to a fitness room on a treadmill. Internet service was satisfactory so I could get work done in my room which faced the ocean. Once work was done I would go to the rooftop bar for a beer to relax. You can't ask for a better \"business\" trip than that.",
            "This hotel lies right between a nice beachfront residentail neighbourhood to the south and an edgy stretch of boardwalk lined with cheap and colourful souvenir stores, drug paraphrenalia supply stores, local fast food eateries and a lively laid back (high?) entrpreneurial and perhaps talented transient group plying their craft/art/special skills, to the north! It is a fun must-see beach. Very different from Santa Monica Beach, Huntington, Laguna, Newport.... you name it, Venice Beach is special. The hotel staff told us the boardwalk was unsafe to walk on after dark. And judging by the daytime crowd, we can easily imagine why. However they neglected to tell us that the area to the south of the hotel is quite different. We almost missed a big part of Venice, complete with lagoons and beautiful (also reasonably priced) beachfront houses. One place rents for $2000US a month for tourists. That's amazing for L.A. The rooms are clean enough, and the staff attentive and courteous. Our partial oceanview room is precisely that - looking straight out, the view is the top of a warehouse type building; crank your neck to the left and you can barely make out the ocean and beach about half a block away. There was no balcony. If you have a car, remember to add the valet parking fee ($16 a day) into your hotel budget. Street parking is not recommended in that area. Also watch out for a \"donation\" for the homeless that they sneak in without asking first. We ended up making the donation, but still felt scammed because they didn't ask and put us on the spot when we reviewed the bill.",
            "I was excited to stay in my first Joie de Vivre Hotel, having heard about the boutique chain from family members. The Erwin Hotel was a great introduction to the JDV way, it's chic and stylish but still affordable. The location in Venice was hard to beat, 1 block from the boardwalk/beach and easy valet parking in a covered lot so you didn't have to worry about your car. The check in area was a little cramped, but the check-in process was very quick and soon we were up in our room. The room was fairly basic but it was roomy and had plenty of modern charm. The restaurant is cozy but they have good healthy food. One unexpected bonus was the sunglasses they had for sale in the room, we needed a pair so grabbed one and paid when we checked out. The rooftop bar is remarkable and the true highlight of the hotel. We went up on a weekday afternoon and there were only a couple other tables occupied so we more or less had it to ourselves. Unbeatable views of the coast. The one drawback of the rooftop bar, as other reviews have noted, is that if your room is near the elevator or stairway that gives access to it, it will be noisy during peak bar times (weekend nights). Overall a great value given the location and the modern design update they've given the hotel.",
            "After checking-in and entering our room - there was an overpowering odor of \"an illegal substance,\" even though this was supposed to be a non-smoking hotel! Immediately called down to the front desk and was moved to another room. Too bad that this was the first impression we received.",
            "I stayed here with my girlfriend last week and couldn't have been happier with the hotel. It is in an AMAZING location, just across from Venice Beach. It also sports outstandingly gorgeous views in all directions from the Rooftop bar, High. We had a clear day, by LA standards, and could see all the way to the Hollywood sign and up to Santa Monica. The High is incredible. The drinks were excellent and the food equally as impressive. We enjoyed breakfast the next morning and our food arrived on time and piping hot. The King size bed was so comfortable we didn't want to leave. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a night away from the busy hustle and bustle of LA. It is a sanctuary of relaxation amidst the concrete jungle.",
            "I stayed at Erwin for one Saturday night in August to celebrate with a group friends. We booked a large suite complete with partial kitchen, fireplace, kitchen table and sitting area separate from the small bedroom. The appointments and decor were great along with a nice touch of street art posters and murals throughout the room. The best touch was the Sam Flores bathroom door. The room was great, however, there were many touches throughout that needed a little rehab. I'm a chipped paint snob, so it is a bit of a turn off when you pay several hundred dollars and walk into a room that needs some repairs. i don't know why those details are so commonly overlooked by upscale hotels. The best part of the hotel is the 7th floor rooftop deck. Grab a corner couch at sunset and enjoy the boardwalk scene with a delicious cocktail. The food was not very good, so sip your drinks slowly and save your appetite for the restaurants on Abbott Kinney."
