[{"entity_id": "B00SC8DDTC", "meta_review": "Once they're broken in, buyers love these boots for their comfort, look, and durability. Very stylish look Full-grain, Sienna Cache leather with rubber sole Comfortable, with good arch support Stitchdown construction offers increased stability Great craftsmanship Sturdy and durable These are a little stiff at first and take a bit to break in This boot tends to run a half-size large", "source_documents": ["After a week of mountaineering in RMNP, I pretty much ripped the skin off my heels and Achilles' tendons. HOWEVER, these boots have great traction, helped me hike up waterfalls and the side of a mountain. They are close to bulletproof. Advice: take some time to truly break-in, wear 2 pair of wool socks (saved me from additional damage), lace for comfort (I'm still learning this), and get blister shields!", "Truly impressed with this purchase. Okay... the boots were way too big. I used the review and charts. I believe I was off a full size. However, I ordered a size smaller and just shipped back the other ones. I was already refunded .New ones coming tonight. I'll update on the next pair. The chart and reviews stating women's sizing was difficult here.I wear a EU 40 or about a 9.5. not in these and my foot is on the wide side. Reordered an 8.5M hope they work! The 8.5 fit well. Odd sizing, great boot!", "I got tired of buying new hiking shoes every year, so after reading reviewes, I purchased these. They have a great stiff sole for walking over uneven ground and rocks. They are also waterproof and look great. I spent some time breaking these in before hiking and I got blisters in the process (happens easily for me) but now they are wonderful. The sole doesn't make for good pavement walking, so I always plan on having a different shoe if I have to do that on the same trip. Looking forward to many more adventures in these.", "I read all the reviews before purchasing and I was hesitant to order a half size down (as suggested on the Danner site and previous reviewers) but I am so glad I did! They fit like a charm. These boots are so expensive I did not know if I would keep them, but once I saw them in person I absolutely could never return them. They are so beautifully crafted and comfortable. I think they will last a lifetime and get better with age. They are my favorite boots!!!", "Worth every penny, gorgeous and high quality boot that will get better with age and last! I wear a 7 normally and a 7 fit perfect. Purchased regular thickness smartwool hiking socks to wear with these. Make sure to break them in before any strenuous activity. I also reccomend using a leather waterproof spray on them to ensure longevity. I love Kiwi heavy duty waterproof spray amd use Kiwi product on all my leather and suede shoes (they make one specifically for suede) its cheap and does the job! I researched these for weeks and waited 2 years before pulling the trigger on these and so glad I did.", "These are perfection! I love them and I've been wearing them with everything. The quality is outstanding and they are beautiful! I wear a solid 6.5 most of the time and even a size 7 in sandals. I went with the Danner website recommendation and sized down. I ordered a size 6 and they fit perfect. I've been wearing the llbean rag camp sock, medium/heavy and could even put a different insole in them and wear a lighter sock I think. I don't think they feel narrow at all.", "These boots were everything I was hoping for, and I had very high expectations. They fit to size, are comfortable from the moment I put them on and they look great! Of course they look great! Based on the construction and quality, I'm sure they will last me until I die. Best part - American made in Portland, Oregon!", "These are beautifully constructed, attractive hiking boots. My only complaint is that they rub on my achilles. I am hoping that they will break in, as I definitely would not be able to wear them on an all day hike unless they do. They are also fairly heavy - I will likely wear them only as snow boots or on short outdoor activities and will find another pair for actual hiking. They are so beautifully made I am keeping them even if they won't work for what I got them for.", "These boots are awesome. They are so cute and a super durable. I hiked in both Grand Tetons and Yellowstone with these. They do take awhile to break in so give yourself time to do it before you're trip. I used mink oil on mine and it did darken the color but they were still beautiful. I debated about ordering a size down or staying to my true size so I stayed with my true size. I had plenty of toe room and after some insoles and boot tying tutorials, I was ready to go.", "LOVE These! I did order a 1/2 size smaller like recommended by the company and they fit perfectly! They are really comfortable and very well made.", "Usually 8.5M US- sized down to 8 & fit is perfect (average feet on wider side). Break in period was torturous- took about 3 - 4 miles before I didn't get any blisters but OMG most comfortable shoes I have now. Got me through my trip in Iceland in all types of conditions no problem & am now hiking in these all over national parks! I'm buying another pair of Danners! I wish I could wear these to work...", "I love my Danner boots! I purchased these boots for our trip to the Grand Canyon and I'm so glad that I did. I wore them for a few days before the trip to break them in and I didn't have any trouble with blisters or any kind of pain. After reading some of the reviews, I ordered the size that I normally wear in shoes and they fit perfectly for me. They are comfortable and very stylish. I got so many compliments on them, especially from people who watched the movie \"Wild\". I would highly reccomend these boots and I think they were worth the price.", "The boots are beautiful. My pair came without the insoles. Maybe that is how it is supposed to be on Amazon, but it is not the case when buying them from Danner directly. The leather has marks on it, and this was disappointing. I sent them back, and I received another pair with the same issue, but much worse. I expected a better quality boot for the price. I still have not worn them because of it. I want to treat the leather first before it gets worse.", "Just a note on sizing. I wear women's 9us in Brooks adrenaline and Asics gel Kayano, the odd dress shoe is sized smaller but in these boots I fit a 7.5. After reading reviews I went half a size down to 8.5 but that is still 1 size too big. They are a long, fairly narrow boot, beautifully crafted and comfortable once u get the sizing right. Use the European sizing as a more accurate guide to fit.", "Really fine workmanship. Very high quality materials and construction. Unfortunately, due to anatomical features of wearer's ankle, the boot caused uncomfortable sensation in heel and Achilles area. Boots returned without prejudice, as many other boots affect wearer in a similar way because of unique anatomy. Otherwise, amazing boots.", "I love the look and the quality. Unfortunately, I had to return due to size. Bought these for my wife, we read the reviews and saw some people mention they ran big, others said they were fine so (considering she's a solid 8.5) we stayed with the 8.5. They were huge. Tried them with thicker socks but it didn't matter. These are exceptionally well made hiking boots and made in the USA (which I love) but we'll have to try again with an 8... or maybe even 7.5?! Good luck.", "Literally just opened the box and put them on and have been walking around the house in them for about 15 minutes. I wanted these last year and couldn't get myself to spend the $$. I thought I would just try them on and if it wasn't an instant love affair I would send them back. I'm in love. I ordered a pair of Timberlands too...no comparison!!! I ordered my actual size and they feel great. If I have any problems or complaints about my boots in the future I will update this review.....if no update is found assume I'm someplace walking around happy in my boots.", "I bought these boots for a cross country trip last summer. We hiked between 10 - 18 miles a day for 17 days straight and they did not disappoint. I wish I had broken them in a bit more before we left, but they were good nonetheless. They were sturdy and tough on some really varied terrain. I also wish I had treated them with a leather oil, but they remained in great condition even after hitting water, rocks and sand! A great looking boot that can live up to the job too!", "Wowser. I'm glad I spent the extra money to purchase these boots. Not only are they beautiful, they are extremely comfortable when out exploring the outdoors. Great traction, even in the mud. Puddles, not to worry, your feet will stay dry. Not heavy on the foot, atleast I don't think so.", "I really wanted to love these boots, but after wearing them around the house I knew they wouldnt work for hiking. They are very heavy and feel clumsy. They also are narrow in the toe box yet slip in the heel area. They also seem more like a fashion boot vs a true hiker.", "Comfortable, I wore them around my house a couple days and they easily broke in. Wore them on my trip to Colorado and they were perfect for hiking. Wore them in Jackson Hole for skiing and loved them.", "If you want a real hiking boot, this is it. They are very stiff when new so do not be surprised at that. They do run a little large so get a 1/2 size down from your norm. I always wear a 6.5 boot in Danner sizing and with these boots, I wear a 6. The styling and quality is top shelf for sure.", "They are sturdy shoes and are very cute. But to me they lack the comfort I am looking for. They are heavy and have caused my feet some serious pain. Personally, I wouldn't buy them again. They don't allow for much movement which is important when hiking over boulders in the Adirondacks. I wish I spent the money on a more flexible and comfortable boot.", "I love my Danner boots. Not only is the boot as great as expected, but Danner customer service is fabulous. They were happy to help me via email. Also very efficient. I've been loving breaking in my new boots!", "Love these! Can\u2019t wait to take these hiking in the Tetons. I can confirm they are true to size, but if you are in between sizes and fluctuate, pick the larger size. I\u2019m an 8 1/2 for flats, but size USA 9 for activewear shoes and a size 9 fit phenomenally with ample rooms. These also break in super well as long as you wear them around the house or short walks a bit a few days before any longer hike as with any hiking boot.", "These boots are nothing less than amazing in true Danner fashion. They are not only beautiful down to the packaging but the quality and craftsmanship is undeniable. They were comfortable right out of the box and will only get better in time. As other reviewers stated they run a little big so I ordered a half size down and they fit perfectly! I like the airthotics that come with Danners which are pretty sleek and don't make a big difference in the fit.", "A quality American made product. Came fresh in the box and have been my go to boot for hiking, snow, and pretty much everything else. I also got the leather conditioner they recommend and my boots still look great after hiking in Rocky Mountain park for a week. And they're cute! Worth every penny.", "These are beautiful boots but they were way too narrow for my feet. I was super bummed because they are so cute.", "Looks great, but for the price paid, I was expecting a much more comfortable boot. I wear hiking boots every day and I wont wear this on a regular basis. The leather is too stiff and the boot is too heavy. Good ankle support. Keen, Timberland, Columbia or Merill are way more comfortable. True to size.", "The soles are pretty big and chunky...so if your feet are large like mine, it can make them look even larger. That part is disappointing, but they're Danners, and that makes them pretty awesome.", "Just got these boots. They are SUPER CUTE!!! They fit as expected. I wear a standard 10, and I am happy with how they fit. I have only worn them once for a short walk around the block. I've heard you have to break them in. I wore them with some thick hiking socks and they felt comfortable. I am a little concerned with the weight of the shoes, so we'll see how that goes on longer walks and actual hikes. I look forward to wearing them on hikes and wearing around the city in the winter.", "What gorgeous boots! I always wear a size 8, but I returned the first pair for an 8 1/2 because my toes felt cramped with only thin socks. The right achilles heel blistered immediately within minutes. I didn't give up and bought mole skin and doubled up on socks to break them in. The leather conditioner by danner is a must. It darkened them beautifully and softned them. After 2 weeks of breaking them in they are keepers!", "Very pricey, but overall good durable shoe. It's true to fit.", "They are absolutely amazing. Totally recommend keeps your feet protected dry and safe", "Loveeeee! Is totally an understatement. Well crafted leather boots that are perfect for all conditions. A boot that finally keeps my feet warm. Can be worn with heavy socks no problem. It was a perfect fit from the moment I put my foot in. I used the danner website to approximate the size I would need and it is spot on.", "I love these boots! I am breaking them in right now probably wearing them a little over an hour a day. I plan on many years of hiking!", "Excellent boots. I have found Danner boots to be a bit narrow, so I order a wide, but they last and last and last. Comfortable and well made.", "Great boots, but need to by at least 1/2 size smaller if not a whole size smaller.", "After months of trying to decide what size I should buy, I finally purchased my regular size which is 8.5. They fit perfectly! And my chunky socks are able to be worn with them! Super fashionable and durable.", "Love my boots! Have got a ton of compliments on them! They are light and comfortable except for they kinda hurt the back of my legs where the tops of the boots sit bc they are so stiff , but I'm hoping that goes away once I break them in.", "I feel like theres nothing that needs to be said about these sexy, sturdy, badass boots. Like whoa. They are everything.", "Pros: Extremely durable. Warm and cool. Stylish. Excellent arch support (and I have extreme arches). Warranty. Cons: takes a bit to break in.", "Gotta pay to get the best and these are the best!", "I sized a half size down. Slightly snug on width of toes, but stretched out after 1 day of wear.", "So far love love love. I usually wear a size 7 1/2 with wider feet. They suggested a size 8. Fits great. Need to break in more!", "These boots fit great! I have been looking for a new boot to replace my old Columbia boots and had a hard time finding something that was comfortable, waterproof, durable, and most importantly fashionable. This hit all the marks. I am usually a size 8.5 but ordered the 9, and the boot fits great when wearing thick wool socks. These boots provide great reaction and have good foot and ankle support.", "I am normally a solid size 9.I ordered a 8.5. The boots fit great with thick socks I still have plenty wiggle room for my toes.", "These boots are so nice! Extremely light and cute enough to wear hiking then out to a casual dinner. I've received many compliments on these.", "I've thought about ordering these boots for years now. I can tell you that I read every single review. Many reviewers were saying these boots ran big while many others said to order your regular size. I decided to order my regular size 8 and they were HUGE!!! The boots are beautiful so I am sending them back for half a size smaller. I'll update my review once I get the smaller size.", "The back of the shoe pressed on my Achilles. Obviously gorgeous - just seems like it is going to take too long to break in.", "Comfortable right out of the box. A small amount of break in required around top ankle portion of boot. Great investment!", "Amazing and I got a great price these! They are still $400 at REI so I'm really happy", "Runs large! I was nervous about ordering a size 8 (I\u2019m usually between an 8.5 and 9) but decided to follow everyone\u2019s advice and they\u2019re perfect! Went on a 5mile moderately difficult hike without breaking them in and they were absolutely amazing.", "I was so excited to receive these...especially at the sale price. They smell absolutely wonderful and I can\u2019t wait to wear them more. They aren\u2019t too heavy which is what I was worried about. They definitely will need to be broken in before longer wear, but they seem to be great.", "i just received the boots today and they fit perfectly. I wear a size 6.5 and thought about downsizing half a size but glad I did not. I can tell the boots are going to be wonderful. I have been wearing them around the house all afternoon and of course they are a little stiff but I can tell they will break in easily.They are not heavy feeling because I am about the size of Reese Witherspoon and they feel good.", "Got these for my wife in her size after reading mixed reviews on sizing. They were much too big and we had to size down a half size. Great boots otherwise.", "They are absolutely perfect!!! I ordered 1/2 smaller than usual per the suggestion from the website and I couldn't be more happy!! They come with a removable long lasting arch support and they are super comfortable.", "They are made really well and I love the look of them. They are definitely a big shoe (had to go down a 1/2 size), even when I found my size the shoe itself still seems big but I still like them. They\u2019re rugged and unique and I get a lot of compliments on them.", "Erhmahgerd, they're great! I can't wait to break them in. Order half a size down.", "These boots are lovely, however, the right one bites into the top of my toes. I love the fact that they are made in America.", "Feels like the long term investment I\u2019ll have for a life time. Sturdy and great to wear whenever", "Nice fit. Obviously well made. Easy to slip on and off.", "Great pair of boots!!! I went down a half size like some of the other reviews said and it worked out great for me. They are very stiff around the ankle but I'm hoping they soften with wear.", "I did get a few blisters which is to be expected with heavy duty hiking boots. Love them!", "Loved the look but I needed a more flexible sole for my hiking.", "Shoes were super cute but really painful at the top back heel. It rubbed them raw and I only could wear them once.", "The boots fit great, they are comfortable to work in. Worst thing is they are very stiff and breaking them was a little painful.", "This is a great boot. Comfortable right out of the box. Runs narrow, which is what I needed. Great support. I look forward to many years of service before the first re-sole is required. Great quality but you won't be disappointed.", "I don't usually write reviews, but these boots are amazing! Comfortable, stylish and an amazing fit all around. I have a narrow foot with long toes, and I usually wear a EUR 39 / 8.5 US. I took Danner's advice and ordered an 8 US. They fit like a glove. Took a day to break them in, since they rubbed my heel a bit, but now are a dream. Got them to go hiking in Isle of Skye in Scotland and they kept my feet comfy and dry even after 5+ hours of hiking in boggy circumstances. I would 100% recommend!! So happy with my purchase :)", "These boots are so well made. Very pleased with quality and style. They already size you up a bit for big socks so don't order up if you are actually using them for tracking vs looking cute... They achieve both.", "These shoes are breaking in very nicely. They don't seem to be bothering my feet with stiffness at all. They keep my feet very warm in the freezing temperatures! I love them!", "My regular shoe size is 9.5! On some shoes I need a 10 (Asics running shoes), but 9 just NEVER fits me. Neverthelss since so many people commented that those shoes would run big, I first ordered a size 9. Also , my husband bought a pair of Denners and needed to go 2 sizes down. However the 9 was way too small. the 9.5 is perfect. Love the color of these shoes, the style...they are awesome. Can't wait to take them for a long walk now!!!", "I have s narrow foot and s true size 7. Fit perfectly. A little stiff but that is typical. Love love love!!", "Broke in very easily and are now my favorite pair of shoes whether I'm backpacking or going to the grocery store. Thanks for making an awesome product Danner!", "My daughter is breaking them in but she loves them", "Received the boots on time and I love them! They also fit as expected which was awesome!", "Very heavy boot and wish I had listened to reviewers suggesting ordering 1/2 size smaller. Waiting for size smaller to compare and will decide if I want to keep. Heel and toe seem very stiff, hoping they break in before trip to New Zealand. Very cute so hoping they work out. Strange tongue piece where they lace up as well. Love that they are made in USA, will do my best to keep! later w review.", "Amazing boots but fit was a bit larger than most shoes of the same size.", "These boots are beautiful. . I went a half size smaller and they fit perfect. . I love love love them..", "Great quality. Just takes a long time to break in!", "Beautiful, well crafted, and made in the USA. Love them", "They are every bit as beautiful, glorious, durable and well-constructed as other reviews have mentioned. They're certainly expensive, but worth every penny!", "Received promptly, but very very narrow. I take a size 8, and way too narrow for me. Sad, because this is a beautiful & well made boot. Wish they came in wide widths", "It took me almost a year to purshase. Because of the higher price, I could always find a better deal. What a waste of time. I could have saved more had I just bought these first! I love them. Glad I read reviews, and bought my actual shoe size. The size is perfect. I wear a 9.5 traditionally and bought a 9.5 yes perfect, with room for thick to moderate hiking socks. The leather is better than expected very soft to the touch. The shoe look are also better than expected. STRIKING!", "These were ordered for a friend as a gift. She says that they are realy comfortable. I ordered a half size larger than normal. Good thing because the are a little narrower than most Danner boots and she wears Danners often.", "Fits as expected, comfortable but the size label on the box and shoes shows a wrong european size, for example 7,5 US size is 38 EUR not 39,5. The Danner website shows right sizes.", "My favorite boots. Wonderful grip, became extensions of my feet as I walked through everything from the mojave to the Grand Canyon. Slot canyons and everything in between. I love the weight of them and how much support they have.", "Get some boot dressing with that to help you break them in, but they look and feel amazing.", "Love them! Retro and comfy...The fit is good not sure yet how they will wear in but they are a perfect snug fit.", "Warm..supportive. .comfortable. .a little stiff gonna take a lot to break them in!", "I was trying a med width, however did not work for me, the quality of the boot met and exceeded my expectation", "I love these boots. They are definitely worth the price. Good traction. Once you break them in they conform nicely to your foot.", "The most comfortable hiking footwear I've owned. Incredible service and beautiful packaging! I can tell these boots will last a lifetime.", "I'm very happy with my new Danner boots! I ordered my normal size and they are a perfect fit. Love everything about them!", "At first I was disappointed because they felt very flat and hard like Doc Martins, but then when I was taking the box to the recycle bin another box fell out. Inside this box were the orthotic inserts. I put those in, and inserted some Dr. Scholl's active (took out of my tennis shoes) and these are so comfortable and durable on our last 5 mile hike. Love them, and they are made to last a life time. Very cool looking.", "First pair of danners. I love them! Worth the money--very comfortable, well constructed, and fit my normal boot size. Didn't order up.", "Love the boot but did not come with the airthotic inserts", "Love my Danner boots!! Perfect for the Rocky Mountians!! \ud83d\udc99", "Love these boots! Great for backpacking! Definitely order a 1/2 size down.", "I was worried about ordering these shoes online and having them fit, but I have to say. I LOVE these shoes. I wish I could wear them all day, every day. They are a little heavy, but at the same time feel like walking on a cloud. I feel like I could conquer anything while wearing these. I have already received many compliments wearing these out and about and I can't get enough of them. The leather is beautiful and soft, the shoe is gorgeous and I can't recommend enough!", "I should start by saying that I love my shoes. I have worn them day one just for a walk around the neighborhood because I couldn't wait and I didn't have the right sox and I paid for it. I got a serious blister on the back of my left heel. Anyways, the shoes are stiff and tough. I am sure they'll become more comfortable with time, but I like the arch support and the look. I can't wait to wear them again, this time for the appropriate outing and with the appropriate sox.", "First off - I love them! They're definitely an investment, but so beautiful and well-made. Secondly, like many others, I was concerned about fit, especially since I was ordering from abroad and returns would be an issue. In the end I ordered my regular size (8) and wear standard-thickness Smartwool socks together with the inserts Danner provided. I recognize that they're relatively narrow, but for me personally it's not a problem. There was a bit of chaffing on the heel, but I put some moleskin and it was fine. Apart from that, very comfortable, very sturdy, with great arch support.", "I'm typically an 8.5 in sneakers and an 8.5-9 in European designer heels, so based on reviews, I ordered an 8.5 knowing I'd be wearing heavier socks. I could have easily worn an 8 in these, but with a pair of smart wool socks, the 8.5 worked well with minimal slippage. I would consider the width to fit TTS, however I can see how others have reviewed these as fitting more on the narrow side. I didn't really have a chance to break them in, but experienced no pain hiking a full day (10 hours).", "these are AWESOME! I usually wear a 7, but can squeeze into a 6.5. Ordered a half size down, since that's what the Danner website suggested. If you are in-between sizes sometimes, def size down! Cutest boots ever.", "These are absolutely stunning and high quality. I am a true 9 and decided to order my size despite many reviews suggesting to order down 1/2 a size. They fit perfectly once you lay the insole in and put on a pair of socks. Extremely happy with my purchase!", "I read reviews from these shoes EVERYWHERE. And against my better judgment I went ahead and got my normal size 9. Which fit well but if you are getting these boots for hiking make sure you go up a half a size! I have pretty normal/narrow feet but I had to exchange for a 9.5 because I knew my toes would be cramped. If you have wide feet I would go up a full size just to be safe.", "I sized down a half size, as the Danner website recommends on their website. The boots fit great. I have been wearing them on short (1-2 mile) walks while breaking them in. No problems thus far! Very happy with the excellent quality of these boots!", "I had to send them back because the sizing is alot smaller than expected.", "I bought these boots last April and since then I never felt disappointed with them. They already made it through 3 days hike in Alps and extreme Russian winter temperatures. I would only recommend to buy care supplies (I have the one from Danner).", "I bought these shoes to go on a British hike. I received this shoes yesterday. But There are serious \u2018wrinkles\u2019 in my left shoe. I tried to open the wrinkles but it was impossible. This is a big defective and I am very disappointed. I want replace or refund. But I will travel to England for one month tomorrow morning. How can i do???", "It was too late when I started to use these overpriced hiking boots. I'm sure you could find something better elsewhere. They fit small and need to be broken in before using.", "Very nice boots. Only issue is one of the boots didn't have the inner bottom liner, so one for awesome and the other was totally flat bottomed. For the price they should come with all the expected pieces.", "I usually wear 8.5. if you are wearing with thin socks, i bought 8US as recommended . First it felt stiff but fitting fine. In the evening My feets are just numb and painful around toes. I guess. It is better just buy your usual size.", "That being said, I was very VERY worried about the fit since I have very wacky feet. After a few days of contemplation, and the comfort of knowing there's free returns, I purchased them in my size (8.5). The site says \"fits like a glove\" and I swear on everything I own that is true. I haven't broken the boots in yet, but after some walking around my apartment, I can already tell these boots and my feet get along very well.", "Ok so I bought two sizes I am a classic size 8.5, however torn because yes size 8 fits like a glove but worried toes will feel scrunched after a while. 8.5 fit well but I am concerned that after a while they may feel loose. If you order your regular size they will fit and you will be able to wear them with thicker socks as necessary if you order 1/2size down you won't get a thick sock on comfortably. So if you plan to wear a regular thin sock or smart wool go 1/2 size down and you should be fine.", "I love the boots in every other way but when I took them out to use them for the first time, I got them a bit dusty so I cleaned them, as per instructions with a damp cloth. I cleaned both boots exactly the same way, with exactly the same cloth, but as you can see in the photo, the darker color from the Danner logo was wiped almost completely away on one of the boots. I'm wondering what to do at this point since they have clearly already been worn, so I don't know if a return is an option ... Feeling disappointed, especially after paying that kind of money.", "Super disappointed. The boots are beautiful however they are supposed to come with a set of inserts. The boots arrived late. The box they were sent it was fine but the actual box the boots came in was not. The inserts are missing.", "Love these! Super fast shipping and such cute boots!! I wear a 7 1/2, ordered that size and they are perfect size!! You can definitely fit a good size sick in them. Love them", "I was very disappointed in the sender of these boots. They could have been perfect. But I knew something was wrong as soon as I saw the box. The box was all torn and taped back together with Scotch tape. Then I noticed that the leather on the boots was scratched up on both boots. And then the Danner inserts that are supposed to come with each boot was not included. I couldn't wait to receive them. I was very disappointed when I opened the box. I sent back immediately.", "I love then, heavier from what I expected but perfect and confy !!", "Hiked up Gunung Batur in these with comfort and style. Great for rocky terrain.", "I wore them on a hike right after I got them.", "They are SO uncomfortable. I am still trying to break them in. I wore them around the house for an hour and skinned my ankles so badly I haven't been able to wear them since. Once I'm healed I'll give them another try with moleskin and see if they get any better, otherwise I'll be returning them. They are beautiful and sturdy, but comfort comes first.", "I loved these boots but I needed to exchange them for a smaller size.

One of the more classic pair of boat shoes by the brand Complements most warm-weather attire from casual to dressy Leather construction earns praise for all-day comfort and longevity Runs large May rub and cause a few blisters during the short break-in period Blisters and rubbing occurs more if worn without socks like most men prefer", "source_documents": ["My son has worn these for 23 days at school (winter uniform started in mid Oct) and they have already fallen apart. This is absolutely unacceptable considering how much the shoes were, and he's not even hard on this shoes usually! I never want to purchase Sperry's again, I am extremely disappointed.", "These shoes won't stop squeaking with each step. I've been hoping it would go away after breaking them in, but it's been 3 months and I still have clown shoes. Don't buy these from Amazon. Edit: I reached out to the company directly and they replaced my clown shoes at no additional cost", "I bought my first pair of top-sliders at Disney World. I wore them most of the trip (7-14 miles a day) and then about half the week for the next 3 years. They are simply amazing. Comfortable, breathable, real leather and you can wear them without socks. This is my second pair of the originals and third pair of sperry branded shoes. All of them have been wonderful. The upper being 100% genuine leather is a big seller for me. The ball of my feet tend to be wide and they stretch very well. Seem to fit true to shoe size.", "They got the length (size) right but are too narrow, despite being ordered as 2E \"Wide\". I've worn Sperry \"boat-moc's\" for decades and every time I have to replace them, the point of manufacture seems to move deeper into third-world countries and the size (mostly width) keeps getting smaller and narrower. Also, if you wear these without socks (like they are meant to be worn), expect the insole to come loose after a short period. One good thing is that the leather uppers \"breathe\" will probably last forever but the soles dry rot prematurely.", "Bought these last year and have only worn them a handful of times. They are extremely tight and they never broke in like the many other pairs of Sperry's I have owned over the years. The also have a very annoying squeak that does not go away. I gave mine to the Salvation Army and ate the $66. because I waited too long to make a return. Don't make the same mistake with this company, these are not original Sperry's.", "The shoes are very comfortable but the quality is totally unacceptable. I bought a pair, wore them for about four days, and then the sole of one of them ripped. I returned the pair, and got another identical pair. This one lasted longer, about 5 weeks, and then the sole ripped on one of these too. The sole started to separate from the shoe. In both cases it looks like there's a weak spot where the stitches go through the sole. It's really a shame. I like the look of the shoes, and they're really comfortable, but they fall apart way too quickly. I could understand one defective pair, but not that I've had two, I'm giving up on them.", "My 14yo son was super excited to find shoes he liked, they fit great and were comfortable but after wearing them 4 times from a parking lot into the ice rink, the sole broke off. It started as a small \"scuff\" and then quickly deteriorated. These shoes were delivered to us on Dec 6th, it's now 10 days later and they are unwearable. To say I'm disappointed in these shoes for the price and name brand is an understatement. He ONLY wore them with his dress clothes for hockey, it's not like he was out running around in them.", "When did Sperry go cheap? I\u2019ve had many pairs of Sperry shoes and have always had good service from them. These seem to be made from another company. Cheap, don\u2019t fit like Sherry\u2019s, they look and feel cheap. I don\u2019t know if Sperry has changed manufactures or plants or what. But these aren\u2019t even in the same category as my old Sperry boat shoes. Unbelievably cheap. I\u2019m done.", "I am a competitive sailor. I also like having a shoe that looks pretty good under casual conditions and that I can just slip on at the last minute. The Sperry Top-Sider fits the bill on all fronts. This shoe is excellent on a wet, listing deck. I do occasionally wear a shoe for certain conditions when sailing, namely if it's quite hot and my feet are guaranteed to be getting sopping wet. But, even when it's chilly outside, I will race in these while wearing Gore Tex socks. Great shoes. They've been around forever for a reason.", "My son only wears these shoes on Sundays to church. After wearing them about 5 times the sole near the toe spilt and pulled back. We love Sperrys. His uniform shoes are black Sperrys which we bought at the mall and he wears them daily to school for the entire year without a problem. We were shocked to see this happen. I reordered hoping this was a defective item so we\u2019ll see but I\u2019m very on the fence now about ordering Sperrys this way. Just greatful that Amazon honored the exchange.", "I have a tough time buying shoes because I'm a 12.5 and somewhere between a wide and a regular width. I haven't had a pair of topsiders since I was a kid in the eighties so I didn't know what to expect with the sizing. I plan on wearing them without socks so I got a size 12 wide. They fit perfectly. I was really surprised how soft the leather is. They started to break in after about 20 minutes of wear. I cant wait until they get all beat up and worn. That's when they look the best. Now I have to buy more in other colors. The wife is going to kill me.", "These shoes are not in line with the quality of previous generations. The sole is hollow in the heel and popped within a week, causing a breathing/whooshing sound with every step I take which is just beyond annoying and makes me hate wearing these. Other parts are separating and coming apart. The insoles have completely fallen out and detached from the inside of the shoe. They just don't hold up and I barely even wear these! I had been a fan for years, but clearly something has changed and not for the better. I'd steer clear of these.", "Easily the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever owned. I bought the Sahara version at the suggestion of many colleges who liked that color. Ideally I wish they were a little darker, would go better with khaki pants if they were. However I'm told that they do darken up with use and age. Also if I wanted to speed up the process, mink oil could be used to darken them significantly although temporarily. Still, these shoes were well worth the price I paid for them and fit better than any shoe I've ever owned with 9 extra wide.", "I've been wearing top siders since 1976. I wonder how many pairs I've gone through. In those days topsiders were brown, that was it. Overtime the conform to your feet. I wear a 14 EE and I used to have to cram into a D and stretch them out but now they come in wide width and fit great from the start. When you wear a 14W shoe you don't get choices, you buy the ones in a 14W and in this case the only choice was Ameretto. These are just beautiful shows. So nice I almost hate to break them in and conform them to my big fat feet.", "I love Sperry boat shoes but the quality has dropped significantly and/or this shoe was a knockoff. The leather looks fine and the shoe seems authentic. One huge thing that suck is there's a lump in the heel that can be felt at every fricken step. This makes the shoes unwearable and it is only present in the right shoe. Again, either quality control is shit or this is a knockoff shoe.", "After three months, the stitching Material has broken and has sole has separated. I\u2019m 76 years young and hardly in physical condition to abuse my shoes. Have you ever tried to find a shoe repair place. My nearest is three hours away. Not the quality I am used to seeing in Sperry Topsiders. I even bought a second pair just for travel and have taken out of the box. Very disappointing. After 50 years of buying and wearing Sperry TS I\u2019ll not be buying again.", "It shows the black color as black top with creams sole and laces, came in all black. Sending back will see if I get right color next time and will update. Update: they dont carry the color shown in the picture, they just show what's not actually there so you waste time ordering them, then shipping them back. Bad way to go for $100.00 shoes. Won't purchase Sperry anymore.", "These are extremely uncomfortable. I\u2019ve never owned Sperrys before but if this is how they all are then I was very disappointed. Considering they are $90!! Also the right shoe was significantly more uncomfortable than the left. I\u2019ve never had a pair of shoes that were actually painful to wear. I was literally limping out of target about ready to give way. They only way I can think to describe how they feel is as if you were walking on something narrow. But they do look pretty nice lol", "I wanted black boat shoes to wear with black jeans. These were an excellent choice. The fit is very comfortable, even for long walks. As for the look, either you like boat shoes or you don't. Your call. If you do, and you want a pair of boat shoes in black, buy this. And, no, if you put on a pair of these well-made, nice-fitting boat shoes, you won't suddenly be overcome by the urge to listen to some Michael McDonald, Christopher Cross, Steely Dan, or other yacht rock icon. These babies are completely safe in that regard.", "Very disappointed by the sperrys I got. I have been buying sperrys every other year, because they normally last for 2 years (or more). I wore these for 2-3 weeks and the rubber sole already ripped and disconnected from the leather body of the shoe. I do not know if these sperrys were authentic or not, or what the reason was for this defect. From now on I will by sperrys directly from their site.", "Sperry's are fantastic shoes, and so so so convenient. I can't rag on them for their durability as I am incredibly hard on whatever pair of shoes I purchase, and choose to wear everyday. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm going to be purchasing a new pair of these every year in the Spring. I've been buying virtually this exact pair for 7 years with minor color differences. I love them, and will likely always have a pair in my closet.", "I wrote a good review when the shoes first arrived. After wearing them for a month (only in the house), they look like they'd been worn for years. The color was literally fading off. I wrote the seller and their best advice was to polish the shoes. Normally that would be reasonable advice. However, these shoes need more than a coat of polish. I believe the tanning process was faulty. I am very disappointed the seller didn't offer to replace the shoes.", "First pair of shoes were defective, so had to exchange. These shoes look great, but if you're looking for comfort, these are not for you. Go for the Billfish or something with a thicker sole. These are literally akin to walking in bare feet. Also, not impressed in the quality for a $70+ shoe. Second pair had hard pieces of stitching poking through the insides that stab my feet. Stitching in leather inserts is also starting to unravel after two days of use.", "Reluctantly, I pulled the plug on my old Top-Siders, but they had a l o n g life! I placed the order for new ones and ordered the same size as my originals (which had to be about 20 years old!). The new shoes (10W) arrived in a very timely manner and when I checked them out I was happy to see that there were well-made with good materials! And they fit perfectly. I must admit I still haven't discarded the old ones, but will soon now that I know the new ones are of the same quality. Totally satisfied with vendor, shipping and product.", "I bought these shoes because the last two pair of Rockport boat shoes literally were falling apart after a year and a half (stitching let go on the left foot along the inside toe box area along the sole and the heals both wore down to where the heal was flapping). Unfortunately, these shoes, while soft and comfortable, are too soft. The sole feels thin and overly flexible with little arch support. I'm afraid I'll be sending them back.", "Not sure what to make of these, whether they're fake or not, they're comfortable and true to size, and a decent price. Leather is real, and soft. Color is nice, and true to the picture (tan). Only issue is the front of part of the rubber sole broke off. Used some super glue and fixed it, and it looks okay and hasn't come off - about two weeks later.", "These are exactly what I was expecting. They seem to be the traditional Sperry Topsiders, perhaps not quite up to the quality of those made in the U.S. (at least from what I recall), but quite good nonetheless. I am a pretty spot-on men's 9 1/2 medium and these fit very well. Not being terribly hard on shoes in general, having worn these several times now - they are comfortable and I anticipate they will hold up well. I did buy them for their style and comfort, not for their function as a true boat shoe, so I can't comment on that.", "I\u2019ve been a Sperry Topsider customer for years. I am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of my recent purchase. I\u2019ve worn these shoes only occasionally in the house (like slippers) or on my patio for 8 weeks. Already the sole is broken away from the shoe! (See photograph). Apparently, I am not the only customer who has experienced this problem. Other reviews highlighted this same quality flaw. Clearly, this is a material or workmanship defect. Amazon should replace this defective product!", "I ordered these Sperry's despite reading some reviews that they weren't up to the same standards as the originals. Upon receiving the shoes which came on time the fit was good although the Arch support is not as good but the overall construction seems to be good. I wore these to Las Vegas and they held up well so I will see how well they hold up in the long term. I have had Sperry's before and they have lasted for several years so I am hopeful that these will last just as long, only time will tell.", "Fit great, timeless classics. This is around my 10th pair of topsiders that I\u2019ve had over the last 15 years. They go with everything, as long as your outfit is casual. They\u2019re the perfect summer shoe! The only thing I suggest is to get some no-show socks to absorb any foot sweat. If you don\u2019t wear no-show socks, the leather will start to stink after a lot of wear. They\u2019re made well, are durable, lightweight, and stylish. Overall, a staple shoe of mine. I\u2019ve never been disappointed by Sperry Topsiders.", "Overall product seems fine, definitely can see with heavy wear how the shoe could fall apart. I plan to only use leisurely around home. Recommend getting half a size up for those with wider feet, wide option isn\u2019t of significance. Update: these wear very easily, I\u2019ve had them for a week and they look like I\u2019ve had them for much longer, with moderate use (3x a week)", "I'm a really old guy. I got my first pair of Classic Top Siders in my early 20's. This is my third pair. These boat shoes last and last and last. They are comfortable and useful and indestructible. I have worn them as business-casual foot-wear, to cut the grass, to run errands, in rain or in shine. IMHO, it's the best shoe-buy you can make.", "The only reason I didn\u2019t rate 5 stars is because the picture made the shoelaces seem like they were the kind that were short and sewn into the shoes making them slip-ons. But what I got was regular speedy suede shoelaces that come untied all the time which is very annoying. The picture also made the color look darker than what I received. Luckily that wasn\u2019t an issue", "This shoe completely fell apart after using it for two weeks.", "The brown pair I received were not the usual A/O 2 eye boat shoes. Mine did not tie and the laces were permanently crossed. They also had a gusset made into the tongue so this was obviously made to be a pair of slip ons and not be tied. I love the look and feel of the leather, sort of a distressed brown color.Right now with the gusset I have a real hard time getting my foot in them. But I'm having the laces fixed so I can actually tie them and the gusset removed. Then I can see how they really fit.", "The last time I bought these exact shoes, I went on a world tour, taking only this pair of shoes, and no socks. I walked for miles in cities and I was always comfortable. They went on to last for years, with just a damp towel used to clean them inside and out. This is my second pair and I think they feel better. I would prefer less tapering and a wider toe box, but I have quite a toe splay and these are normal shape. They eventually stretch to your toe width.", "Been wearing these almost exclusively for twenty-plus years. Absolutely love these shoes. Comfortable, goes with many ensembles, comes in wide sizes. Lately, the upper separates from the sole too easily (at or near the toe). Planned obsolescence? Maybe. Seem to recall the upper being sewn to the sole, but no longer. Now they are glued and the glue fails too soon. Nevertheless, these shoes remain awesome. Improvements? Please make the all-black version of this shoe in wide widths.", "These shoes were a fantastic bargain at $56.00. I've been buying Sperry products for several years, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of their products. I also purchase them for my grandson, who needs them for his school uniform - dress code. These shoes retail for a much higher cost than what I paid. I highly recommend them.", "Last pair of Sperry's I ordered (10-1/2 wide) fit perfectly. Ordered the same size this time and returned them as they were too tight. Replaced with 11 wide; better fit but a bit snug, feet have probably changed a bit since I purchased the first pair. I expect the new shoes to stretch a bit with continuous use like the first pair did. Style is classic and they look great.", "I was very happy to find my son the shoes required by his high school in his size. It's very difficult to find size 16 anything. I do wish they had the buit in comfort that the Rockport shoes possess. His shoes unfortunately don't have adequate support and are making my son's feet ache. Maybe this is something the company could work on. Also my son is only 14 and still growing so if you could please make bigger sizes upon demand.", "These A/O Original boat shoes have two eyelets, making it possible to adjust the lace tightness to allow you to slip them on and off like a loafer. They look great and are fine for light duty use. However, the foot-bed has almost no arch support or sole padding, which makes them a poor choice when you need to do a lot of walking.", "My husband has worn these shoes for many years, and he needed a new pair. He was unable to buy them locally, so we found them on Amazon. He was very reluctant to buy them on-line, but he is very happy with his purchase. He loves the color, the fit, and he says he will buy his next pair on Amazon.", "I buy a pair of these about once every year or so, depending on how quickly I wear them out. What's to say? They're a classic, tried and true design, and I love the Black/Amaretto color scheme. Actually, the black lower almost looks like dark, dark, midnight blue\u2013to my eye it's very, very nearly black without being jet black\u2013my opinion. They're super comfortable and they're just a classic boat shoe. I've been buying these for more years than I remember. If you want a quality pair of boat shoes, get the Sperrys.", "initially, i ordered a gray topsider in the same size as my 6 year old topsiders (10.5 M), but they were too big. so i returned them for a 10M in the brown on brown color. not sure if Sperry has changed their sizing over the years, but the 10 fit perfectly. the same shoe was 30 dollars more expensive at a local retail. so, with free shipping, the shoe was a bargain! delivery was prompt! love the shoe!!", "He wore them twice and the sole is already coming off. Not what I expected for the price. I bought them so long ago and gave them to him as a father's day gift and he tells me a week ago the sole is coming off. Now, I don't even know how to get my money back or get my dad new shoes.", "The shoes are ok. There was a manufacturing defect in my pair. Every time I take a step with my right foot and put the heel down I get a sound of air escaping the sole of the shoe. It's loud enough to hear when just walking down the street. You get what you pay for. Bought through amazon so you have to expect Sperry to have a lower level of quality than if you bought them in the store. I still wear them but I am annoyed and always conscious about the \"air sound\".", "I am a woman sometimes our shoes (especially leather) fits really tight before broken in so I wanted to try the guys. I normally wear a 8 in women\u2019s I purchased the size 6 1/2 in men\u2019s and the fit was perfect. I think if I had purchased the size 7 I could have worn with socks but I prefer to wear my loafers without socks. The 6 1/2 fits just right.", "I have been wearing Sperry Top-Siders for 29 years. My past 3 boat shoes have lasted over 9 years each. Sturdy, quality workmanship is why I keep purchasing them. Comfortable and stylish, I wear them throughout the Spring and Summer months whether wearing shorts or jeans. Highly recommended!", "These just aren't what they used to be. There is a paper-like insole that started to come off the sole the first time I took the shoes off. Where that insole has started to roll up is uncomfortable and cheap. I have been buying these for over 10 years and have never had this problem. It may be time to consider other boat shoes.", "After only 4 days of light wear, the stitching on the toe broke through the sole and the whole sole detached (see pictures). Returned for credit! I compared these to a previous pair and the construction is completely different -- thinner stitching, different sole material, etc. Otherwise, the shoe was good looking and comfortable. Unfortunately, another case of a good product ruined by trying to make it cheaper!", "I bought these for my husband who is hard to fit with a 13 extra wide. These fit great and he wears them all the time. Easy to slip on for him, as he's had 2 knee surgeries and doesn't bend over very well. So much better than sandals for him, since he has a hard time keeping sandals on his feet (for some reason). Strongly recommend these shoes. He's had several pair and wears them until they wear out.", "I had these shoes for about 6 months and have worn them about 6 times before the front sole broke off. I've had my other pair for 20 years and they're still going but the sole is starting to wear out and thought it would be nice to get a fresh pair. The quality seems to have gone way down. Unfortunately it is beyond the return time.", "I wore 9 1/2D for years, then noticed in most shoe brands I need a 10 or 10 1/2. I ordered the Sperry in 10, but it is true to fit and I should have gone with 9 1/2. Easy return, and the price even dropped from $58.50 to $52 by the time I re-ordered. The 9 1/2 size feels comfortable, but seems they will be harder to break in than my previous Sperrys. Nice rich color, stitching looks well done, and the foot-bed is perfect for going sockless.", "I'm returning these junk knock offs. These are absolutely fake. Look up the real Sperry logo and font. I have bought many Sperrys and these are no comparison to the real thing. The genuine logo is outlined square with a wave under the sailboat. These have a diamond outline and the wrong logo. This is a poor attempt at a great product. Stay away.", "Received these shoes for my husband on January 28, 2019 - less than 4 months later the sole cracked at the stitching on one shoe and is pulling away. The leather uppers are still in good shape, but unsatisfied with the overall quality for almost $60. I have bought him Sperry's in the past at a Department store and they have lasted for a couple of years. My guess is they do not sell top quality here.", "I bought these shoes and loved the style and fit but I was torn between these and the Sahara color and once I saw my brothers In person I loved those so much more. Didn\u2019t really like the white sole on mine. And as for the Sahara color, it is actually lighter in person! Which is exactly what I wanted. The picture online looks too dark. Attached pics for reference! If you\u2019re debating between the oatmeal and Sahara i definitely recommend the Sahara color. (Sahara left foot - oatmeal right foot)", "But for a little problem, these were the shoes of my dreams. The problem -- the insole only goes about 2/3s of the way from the heel to the toe and near where it ends, under the ball of your foot, there's a ridge that I think is part of whatever is under the insole. This ridge put pressure on the bottom of my foot which made the shoe largely unwearable. Aside from that, the size, the softness of the leather, the way the side of the shoe stopped below my ankle bones (my ankle bones are close to the bottom of my foot which makes finding shoes that work a challenge), everything was perfect.", "If so, slide yourself into a pair of these sweet kicks. NOTE: I have this color, as well as the basically \"uncolored\" version. You should know the \"uncolored\" version breaks in faster than this dark version... Mostly due to the extra treatments on the leather. Also, the darker shoes are a bit more water resistant due to the extra treatment. As always, do NOT wear socks with boat shoes. If you plan to wear socks with these, please dont buy them.... just move on to a set of Teva's or something with a reputation that's already on the rocks. PRO TIP: get a boot/shoe/glove drier and put your leather shoes on them at night.. THEY WILL NEVER SMELL.", "Good shoe except heel design. I have many boat style shoes by other manufacturers. All the other manufacturers do not put the upper shoe seam directly at the heel like these. They immediately started bothering my heel the first time I wore them for an extended period of time. I did not notice the seam when I bought them and I take responsibility for that and I can't return them since I already water proofed them.This is my first Sperry brand and will probably be my last.", "No complaints. Classic Sperry Topsiders - great casual shoe for warm weather. I got the espresso color, which is close to a wine/burgundy and looks great with khaki chinos. Comfortable from the start, very comfortable once broken in (which doesn't take very long).", "I like the color used to illustrate the color of the shoes on the Amazon web site. I was surprised that the shoes I received were lighter. The shoes themselves are fine and they are well constructed but in my opinion not much different than other competitor shoes in similar price points.", "Like other reviewers, I have worn this brand/style shoe for a very long time. When production moved overseas there were some quality problems that have been mostly solved. These shoes WILL NOT leave scuff marks on the deck. When worn in they are astonishingly comfortable.", "These are the same model as ordered previously; however, these are made in Indonesia fit as hoped, 14 W. Great leather that is soft from day 1. Comfortable like my earlier pairs. Will order again!! Prior pair from Dominican Republic (same size, same color) were narrow and not nearly as soft. I have worn Top Siders for decades and this was the first variation. Not sure how to identify origin. Sent note to Sperry who responded quickly. Await their response as to what should be specified. They said all locations use the same last, but size was very different.", "I just discovered that Sperry offers two different, \"Sahara,\" colors for their topsiders. The picture on the left is called, \"Sahara.\" The picture on the right is called , \"Sahara Leather.\" I ordered , \"Sahara,\" with the darker and more polished tan color, but I received ,\"Sahara Leather,\" a much lighter, and dull color. The label on the box is correct, \"Sahara,\", but the shoes in the box are the much lighter and dull \"Sahara Leather.\"", "I've had previous Sperry boat shoes and some of the other reviewers (posters) are correct. The quality is not as good. When are these manufacturers going to learn? You can't fool most customers! If you try to cut corners to save money and make a bigger profit, you're GOING TO LOSE IN THE END, because the customers will go somewhere else. DON'T TRY TO FOOL THE CUSTOMER!! ......... ESPECIALLY NOT THE OLDER ONES!! .......WE'VE BEEN AROUND TOO LONG!!!", "Bought these as an anyday casual shoe. I enjoy them quite a lot. They look nice and feel great.. I can tell the quality of materials will hold up to wear and tear and should last a long time.. the light color does show stains (even water) fairly easily so you may want to invest in some leather protectant.", "I got the Sahara color and they looked a bit lighter than what's pictured on the product page. The shoes looked perfect when I saw them, and there weren't any scratches or dents on the leather. It was essentially in pristine condition! The shoebox on the other hand came beat up because it was shipped in a bag, but that didn't matter after I saw how great the top-siders looked. Overall, I'm glad that I bought these to replace my old top-siders and they are definitely worth it.", "I like them. I have been wearing them for fourth two years and I have style and comfort. But my observation is that your purchasing department have employed new standards and at least I appreciate them there spot on. But getting that out the way. There still a great shoe.", "I like having a shoe that I can just slip and go that look stylish. Theses are basically my sandals for going outside. I've had a few pairs that have outlasted many of my everyday shoes. I don't recommend them for long walking because they're completely flat.", "I love these! Lightweight and very flexible casual shoe. They may be designed for boat wear but I have worn this model almost daily in and around the house for over 10 years. The new shoe is nearly identical to the one I\u2019m replacing, even has the same part. number. Full leather inside and out (except for some padding under the leather heel pad). Easy to slip on and off. I was going to resole my old ones, again, but the sale price of nearly 40% off was too good to pass up.", "I wore these shoes three times and they fell apart. No knock to the shoes as I have had several pairs and loved them, but these were defective and fell apart after wearing them three times. SOFTMAC has been awful. I requested to return these for another pair and here I am two months later still trying to get in touch with someone that can help. They are supposed to send me a shipping label for a return...but haven't. Unless someone at SOFTMAC sees this steps in to help, I will avoid them like the plague going forward. I literally feel like I lit a $100 bill on fire by purchasing these shoes from them.", "Love these shoes. Great quality and brand new condition as advertised. I've worn them at.least three times already. But NOTE: the Sperry's listed with \"O/A\" like these, fir best to the exact size of your foot. In my experience other Sperry's still have too much space above the toe. And I'd you're like me then any space left is too much. Cause like...who needs extra space in their shoes, like seriously for what! -_- But these are great. Love em. And more on my list from this seller to buy as well. Shipping was great. They use FedEx, and the driver came right to my door and everything. Greest purchase.", "It's a shame that an individual can order two identical sizes of the Sperry Topsider shoe and receive two pairs that are more than an inch difference in length and width. Where are the standards for sizing any more? What a waste of time it is to have to order and return several pairs of shoes that are all the same size but fit so differently in width. Shame on Sperry!!!", "As expected great quality and brand. laces came tied nit like photo.. i have other sperrys that have a cross shape \u201cno tie\u201d. easy enough to relace in a cross as there are only 2 lace holes. will find a way to knot them inside and cut the leather laces to allow them to slip on and stay no tie cross shape as pictured. otherwise awesome", "I have worn Sperry boat shoes for nearly 46 years. If you like the feel of the deck, you get it in these shoes. Stylish and virtually impossible to hurt. Help fit it by putting them on your bare feet and then immerse them in water for a few minutes, 5 will be sufficient. Then put them out in the back yard to dry. You can wear these on the boat, at the yacht club or at work. Style and function is Sperry !!", "I love Sperry's but had to return these twice because I couldn't get the size right, which was odd. I think it's the shoe model that was much different than usual. I don't know but after returning twice, I gave up. They were tight, narrow, tough feeling as though there was no give in the material. I found them uncomfortable all the way around.", "I love these shoes! This is my 3rd pair, the funny thing I still have my other two pair, the only issue that after putting such a beating upon them I do not feel they are presentable to wear out so I replaced them with a shiny new pair. But they last! And they are super comfortable! They are one of the best things you can put on your feet -- rain, shine, but haven't tested snow yet. But will keep you posted once I do.", "I have really enjoyed sperrys over the years and was excited to get a new pair for the first time in 6+ years. I have owned 3 previous pairs and all have lasted at least 5 years with heavy use. So I was very disappointed to discover that after 2 months of minimal use the sole started separating from the shoe. I\u2019m not sure if it was just an unlucky pair or if Sperry\u2019s quality has significantly decreased over the years. Sad part is I wish they broke sooner so I could return them under the return policy and give sperrys another try.", "I use the Original Leather Boat Shoe as a house shoe; easy to slip on and off. After 11 months, the sole around the toe broke. I think the stitching was too tight and cut into the sole. I have much older Sperry boat shoes that have not had this problem. I had new shoes in four days after contacting Sperry Consumer Relations.", "Based on some of the other reviews I was concerned that the EEs would be too narrow for me. They are not; they\u2019re perfectly true to size and very comfortable. The style is excellent - exact match with the photo. Time will tell regarding the durability, but in general I am very pleased with the purchase.", "Bought these for my 44 year old son, his second pair in 2 years. They are appropriate for casual wear and rarely look 'tired.' Ordered a size 12 regular width and they fit true to size. The sahara color is a slightly darker shade than butterscotch and appeared to me to be lighter in color than advertised on the website, but attractive nonetheless.", "I have been buying docker shoes for decades. While Sperry shoes are more expensive, they LAST. I wear mine literally every day of the year and they last 1 1/2 years to presentably wear at work. After that, while beat up, they can last for two more years beating around at night with them.", "I loved my last pair of Sperry's, purchased 6 years ago. They were very comfortable. The new pair I received was deficient in both appearance and comfort. The brown looked dull in comparison, my toes feel squeezed in one of the shoes, and worst of all, I can't walk for more than a few blocks in these before the balls of my feet start hurting. The construction of these shoes just doesn't cut it. I love the boat shoe style, but I can't go out in these shoes anymore. I'd recommend finding a different source of boat shoes if you enjoy pain-free walking.", "Just like a good number of critical reviews, the pair I got is a little narrow than the pair I had before. So it's either the product quality has depreciated or my feet got bigger. Either way, I needed some time to break it in. I'd just suggest consider getting W sizes just to be sure they fit comfortable right away.", "Great shoes fit as expected I would recommend wearing a pair of socks for their first outing to help reduce the chance of blisters. The leather takes a day or two to break in so if your feet aren\u2019t ready for that it could be uncomfortable. Once broken in they fit wonderfully and are great for just about any occasion", "The stitching that holds the sole to the shoe cut all the way through the sole at the toe and this made the sole no longer attached. This affected both shoes and I nearly tripped several times. Hopefully I just got a bad pair as I've returned the shoes and reordered a new pair. Also the color was too light.", "I love the shoe, they look and fit great right out of the box with no discernable break-in time. HOWEVER, ever since I got them wet for the very first time (keep in mind, they're boat shoes, designed to get wet), the right shoe wheezes and hisses whenever I put weight on it. It's pretty annoying, especially because everybody around me can hear me walking. I might try to return these and get a different pair, hopefully the seller reaches out to me.", "These are very quality shoes, I already have a pair that are about twenty years old, they have gotten dirty and unable to clean them anymore and the new ones haven\u2019t changed a bit. Thank You", "I got these because a pair of $40 slippers I bought from a department store ended up wearing out and getting really nasty after only a month of use. I\u2019m extremely happy how much less my feet sweat when wearing these around the house in winter, and i know they\u2019ll be an amazing boat shoe to wear in the summer once I get back out on that lake.", "Great shoe (Sahara). I have had Sperry shoes for over 30 years. Some better than others. The white soled shoes don\u2019t seem to last too long, though. Just bought my second pair to keep available when the current pair (8 months old) wear out. I usually get 2 to 3 years wear. Very comfortable and this \u201cmodel\u201d is one of their better ones. I usually wear a 11 1/2, but had to go with a 12 . Amazon was super on the exchange.", "At 86 years old, my yachting days are gone (other things, too). I have worn the Sperry ICE color since 1954. I thought that I was super cool on a 42 ft. Owens, powered by twin Chrysler Marine Gray 115 hp engines, displacement 13 tons. In this shoe, Sperry has exceeded all expectations and has evidently introduced innovations. This is absolutely the most comfortable shoe that I have ever worn. And I wear Florsheim Imperials (Italy, no longer available) and Bally - this shoe is MY SHOE. I settled for this color because I could not find my ICE color. Now, I prefer this color. It goes with the yacht that I don't have.", "My son loves the shoes and this is the second pair that I have ordered for him .... Now if I can just get him to stop wearing them to play outside (Yes he's a teenager) i'd be a happy mom . Picture is after a couple of months of wear... Very good for teenage boy shoe life .", "Extremely poor construction. I bought these in May and in a couple of months these are literally falling part. The stitching is coming off, the sole has cracked and the left show has started squeeking with every step I take. And these are not the only shoes I've worn, but are part of my 4-6 pairs that I wear on rotation. Extremely disappointed. I want a refund! Conversely, the Sebago shoes I bought 6 years ago are still going strong. Just normal wear and tear that you expect.", "Wanted another pair of casual shoes, remembered that I had a pair of these (cough, decades, cough) long time ago. Checked the mall, but all they had was the fancy blue, or glittery pairs. These are comfortable, casual, breathe well and stylish enough for my work area. I would not recommend a twelve mile hike, but that is not their design. Really like driving with them. Construction seems about the same as I remember. My previous pairs lasted more than several years; I hope these will do the same. Now I'm thinking, maybe I should buy a boat.", "These are very comfortable and well made as usual, and the lace up helps with getting them to fit better. They have a good arch support and are soft enough to be comfortable with out socks, and have enough room to wear socks for more casual attire. The insole has a very good arch support and good heel support. I have bought many of their shoes and have always been satisfied with the endurance of the shoe, and the ability of the leather to maintain its good looks.", "Found these under $90, on sale most places at 99 or over 100. Ordered online with prime, came in, wore them out the door. Have worn them every day for a week now and love em. Just like my last pair. These are Sperrys. The original boat shoe I grew up on. Fits as expected to me- maybe a bit wide but I may have ordered a bit too wide but good color, good fit, its a Sperry.", "My favorite shoe ever. My right foot is slightly larger than my left but these stretch to accommodate. I have had these in the past last over 20 years. Started wearing them while working on sport fishing boats in the 70's. So glad I found them. I prefer Asics for hiking.", "I got this on warehouse deals. Bass makes a good shoe, one of the last companies to do so. The color is ugly but okay with jeans. I mean how many people are going to notice ugly brown shoes?", "I bought a pair of navy deck shoes that were pictured with the traditional brown and tan leather laces. The shoes delivered came with all white laces. Due to the traditional around the ankle lacing this is difficult to fix. Yes it is a minor issue, but as I usually wear blue leather deck shoes with khakis and a brown leather belt, it is the little bit of brown lacing that makes it all work.", "I've been wearing Sperry Topsiders since my college days at UVa. Comfortable and durable. I have a pair for yard work and a pair for lounging around. Can't recommend them highly enough.", "Over time I've had at least six pairs of topsiders. These look the part but will never walk the walk. Sizing smaller than expected and wide width is non-existant. I'm about to do the soak down and stretch for fit. Fully expect them to disintegrate. Will update after.", "I have been wearing Sperry's for about 30 years. I wear them year around. For the last 30 years I have worn a 10W. Now the 10W is too narrow and about 1/2 an inch shorter than my old pair. I had to return them and get a 10 1/2W. Now they fit better. I still love Sperry shoes but they don't seem as well made as they used to.", "As for the style and color, this was exactly what I wanted. However, this was the second pair of amaretto Sperry Authentic Original Boat Shoes I ordered in size 11-D and have had to return both. The first pair fit more like a 10.5-D (both too short and too narrow). The second was the right length, but too narrow. I have just ordered a third pair in size 11-2E (which bumped up the price about $16). I am hoping this will do the trick. Fortunately, the UPS drop-off location is a 3 minute drive from home.", "Shoes seemed great, but as an occasional wear shoe I don't expect the soles to be shredding off in less than a year. I wouldn't even expect that if I wore them every single day. Sperry is a good brand - 100 days of wearing should not result in this sort of condition.", "Perfect color and fit. I love these. Classic shoes that are timeless and look good in many situations.", "There was a great deal for my son's size 13 shoes ($59.95) so we purchased 2 pair. They arrived and were not the shoes pictured on Amazon's website. We went to Sperry's website and the name of the shoe Brown Buck is not the picture of the shoe shown on this site. Too late to do anything about it as the boy is heading off to college this weekend and needs shoes.", "I have had many pairs of Top-Siders over the years and always found them to comfortable and durable - the soles always wore out before the tops gave up. These fit well right out of the box and will only improve as they are broken in. Some reviewers indicated that they thought the quality was not the same as it ounce was, but to me they appear to be of the same high quality as always. Time will tell if they are as durable as in the past.", "There are a number of Sperry deck shoes. The Authenic Original is the only one that fits my husband perfectly. The others are too narrow even in the Wide size. Great shoe.", "I wear A/O topsiders pretty much all the time. They look acceptably casual at work, but most importantly, they are ridiculously comfortable. One thing to be aware of: When you first put them on, they may feel a bit snug. As long as your toes are not crammed into the shoe, they'll loosen up into their normal comfy selves within a day or so.", "Loved the shoes, didn\u2019t love the fact they were scuffed, dirty and apparently used. At best they were on display and tried on by a million shoe shoppers. At worst they were used, then returned. I sent \u2018em back. The takeaway? Never buy anything without free returns\ud83c\udf78", "These are very nice casual boat shoes. Very well made and fit perfectly. My husband loves them. They look expensive not cheap. I have purchased Sperry before and the quality hasn't gone down as so many other things usually do! Bottom line, These are great casual deck\\ boat shoes.", "I have been buying/wearing Sperry A/O boatshoes for longer than I care to disclose. This was the very first pair that have not fit perfectly out of the box. I bought an W width, but it was far from being a wide shoe. I\u2019m hoping this was a true anomaly as I\u2019ve ordered the replacement for what I had to return. I will update this upon receipt of the new ones.", "Bought these for my 35-yo son for Christmas. He loves them. They are genuine Sperry's I was skeptical about ordering them as Sperry's are rarely discounted and I feared they might be fakes. My son, a self-proclaimed Sperry expert declared them genuine!", "I am very cautious about ordering footwear online. However, nowadays I do not have much choice. These boat shoes are as good as it gets for me. I'm so glad I ordered them. They are well made and look sleek on my feet!!!", "I have owned 4 pair of Sperry Topsiders (I'm 79 years old). But their quality seems to have deteriorated recently. If I'm fortunate enough to need another pair of boat shoes, I will shop around.", "I wear a 10 1/2. These are 11 1/2 and fit perfect. My aging Sperry TopSiders were 10 1/2 and fit fine forever but I bought a pair and returned them. Even when these \"fit in\" they will not be too large at all.", "We purchased this item Jan. 30th of 2019. Was kept in box until very important event April 5th 2019. When opened, 1. they were not the color purchased, 2. they feel apart two hours into the event. Very dissatisfied customer. Will try to contact seller again for either replacement or return. If neither happens, will never purchase from this seller again.", "I bought these and the \"upgraded\" version from the same manufacturer. I returned the more expensive version. They were not worth the money for very minor improvements and actually were less comfortable with the memory foam inserts. These fit as expected are comfortable and I expect them to be very durable.", "Not as well made as original Sperry\u2019s. As a boat owner I use these as real boat shoes...not walking around... After one time on the boat I was Surprised how easily the leather scuffs. Like everything else it lives by name only....", "I have a pair of sperry cup collection I purchased 5 years ago in a 9m and they fit great. Purchased same size in these and they were very very tight. I have a wider foot but I didn't think that wide so maybe I'll just stick with gold cup since the leather tends to be of better quality. Other then that the shoe looks great just as described. Also a few weeks ago stopped into the mall and tried on same shoe and size but in wide and still very tight. Then I came across sperry gold cup. Size 9 medium fits like a dream and the leather is fantastic. Spend the extra money, you'll be glad you did", "Been wearing sperrys for a long time. This pair is just as good as the others. This is the classic color and style of boat shoe. I believe they get better with age to an extent. Once the leather gets wet for the first time they really come to life. They perfectly form to my foot and are the perfect casual dress shoes. if they get nicked or scuffed, who cares? It just adds character. I really hope these have fell out of style with frat boys because i was catching flack for a while. Jeans or slacks, polo or jacket, sperrys all the way.", "First of all, I always order 1/2 size smaller than my husband's usual size when purchasing men's boat shoes. My husband also has a somewhat narrow foot, so his usual size would be way too large. The fact that he will wear them in the summer w/o socks is another reason to size down. Now on to these shoes.....they are beautiful. The color, Amaretto, is absolutely beautiful with the darker shade sole. The leather is substantial with a perfect sheen. He wore them right away...so that's telling you that he's completely sold on these shoes.", "Obvious blemish in the toe area - could be the reason I was able to pick these up for 60 dollars compared to retail 95. They weren\u2019t advertised as factory seconds, but I can\u2019t imagine anyone buying Sperrys in person with obvious blemishes. I bit the bullet - sent these back - and went to my local shopping mall to pay retail price for assured quality.", "I love these shoes. I got a pair almost five years ago and have been wearing them as my dress casual shoes for business. I travel a great deal and spend a lot of time on my feet, walking etc. They are comfortable, over the years they have gotten softer to the point where feel like slippers, not shoes. The new pair are identical to my old ones, my old ones are now my casual shoes. They are not the only Sperrys I have, but these are my favorites. All of their stuff is great quality and comfortable, and don't forget the sole has great traction on a wet deck.", "These shoes are a classic. They can be worn all year long honestly, but I typically will wear them every season but the winter. They fit well and go well with jeans, khaki, shorts, etc. I use to own ones that had fabric inner soles, which would cause them to smell funky when you do not wear socks, but these had leather inner soles, and I have not had that problem. They were a great deal too, can't wait to get another pair since I am starting to wear the outer soles down.", "This was a deal too good to be true. It said it was the last one for about half price. Yes it was the last one; either a return, old stock, or simply clearance stock. The shoes were so old the white soles were yellowed, and as you can see from photo two, the sole was cracked. As soon as I unboxed the shoes I requested a return for credit.", "These are not authentic Sperrys, which still manufactures boat shoes with a wave pattern etched into the sole. These do not have that sole. Returning.", "I'm very happy with the shoes. I ordered them hoping for a good fit, and won. These are comfortable shoes. My 5th pair. These guys beat delivery expectations. Everybody's a winner on this one.", "I ordered a 8.5 XW. The shoe is marked as an 8.5 XW. But it fits more like a standard width shoe. The shoe is beautiful - the leather is nice, the inside of the shoe is perfection. Just wish it really was an XW shoe.", "This is the classic wear-without-socks boat shoe. The leather is soft and thick, and the sole actually does grip when wet. After a short breakin period with some leather conditioner, they'll feel like slippers.", "I\u2019ve owned top-siders in the past, and these seem every bit as well made as I remember. I wanted a tan loafer that I could wear with shorts or slacks and these fit the bill perfectly. I can even walk a mile or two in these in comfort, although I\u2019d not recommend them for long walks or hiking. Recommended.", "I selected 7.5 and it is a little smaller for my right foot. But the quality is very good. I am rerunning this pair and go to order size 8.00. Hope it will fit me perfect.", "They're Sperry topsiders, same as always. If you know your size, they always fit. And they always look great (assuming you like the look of true boat shoes.) I've tried every other brand on the market, and despite the high price of Sperry, I always eventually come back to them. There's no substitute.", "I've always bought knock-off Sperry shoes at my local Kohl's or JCPenny's. I have been wrong for years. Those shoes always fall apart within months. I wear these Top-Siders everyday, and they still look brand-new! They cost more... but you get more. They fit really well, haven't stretched out, and if you wear boat shoe liners you can keep them smelling fresh a lot longer - which also extends the life of the shoe. I highly recommend buying these from Amazon if you are having a hard time finding plain colors at your local shoe store.", "Well. I have owned Topsiders FOREVER. They now make them in many different countries, and therefore EVEN IF THE MODEL NUMBER IS THE SAME the shoes are made with different materials and SIZES. Since my most recent pair disintegrated, I started buying them from here. I cannot get the right fit, even though they should be consistent. The soles are the same; it's the uppers that are different material as well as differently sized. Ugh. If you buy these, prepare to buy many and return... probably all of them, because you won't know what you get until they arrive.", "They fell apart in less than two months. I did not wear them on a daily basis. They fit well but were not nearly durable enough. I would not purchase these shoes again .", "I bought these shoes for my sons big thirtieth birthday. He really liked them. Too bad I didn't know his correct size. We were both disappointed I had to return them. Customer service was wonderful. A lovely girl helped me through the return process. The new shoes and the right sized ones arrived just a few days after his birthday. The first ones were a nice color but they didn't come on his size , he likes the colt of these just as much. He couldn't take them out of my hands fast enough. Tip, I could be wrong but when I order from amazon and shipped by amazon I'm always more than pleased.", "I have had several pairs of SPERRY shoes over the years and loved them, however this pair of the SAHARA name scuffs so easily leaving lighter colored streaks all over the shoe. Just for the heck of it, I went on EBAY and found the same SPERRY shoes SAHARA for $39.00 and numerous people selling them. What does that suggest... To me it says a lot of people may have found the same problem. Frankly, I don't know, you be the judge of that. I will be buying another pair of SPERRY as they have always served me well. D. R. LAFRENIERE.", "Ordered some new Topsiders to replace my old ones (old ones were years old, still in good shape, but were grungy). Purchased the exact same model and they fit perfectly! FYI....as a Floridian and boating/fishing guy, all I wear is Topsiders for casual wear. Tough, durable, light weight, look good and can't wear them out!", "I purchased these Sperry Boat Shoes last September and the right shoe has already had the toe separated from the sole and the sole has split at the stitch line. I have worn Sperry Boat Shoes for many years and hey have lasted well until this pair! Not sure I will but these in the future.", "Anyone buying these knows what they are. This is the same shoe I've worn for 30+ years and when it was time to retire my last pair I ordered these. Quick shipping, the classic topsider I know and love at a good price AND they had halfsizes (the two stores I stopped at didn't). Nice to know this shoe is still around exactly as it has been.", "This is a nice comfortable wear. Fit as expected. Quality material but scraps easily and when it is scrapped it is hard to get it out of the material. Other than that its looks and feels good", "No problem with seller, but shoe sole is junk. Heal collapsed within 2 days making shoe very uncomfortable to wear. Only ever had this problem with one other pair of shoes, a Walmart special. Granted I\u2019m heavy (over 200lbs), but was completely disappointed.", "Difficult to find top-siders in black. I am very casual,, so, tend to wear top-siders a lot. I have worn these only once, but, did get unsolicited compliments on how good they look. These are black leather trimmed with Amaretto colored leather.", "Shoes were great but super disappointed they completely let go and broke after month and a half. I\u2019ve never had a shoes sole break like this before. Just astonishing, not sure if this pair is a lemon or this is just the quality that is to be expected. I own another pair of sperries that I bought 7 years ago and are in excellent condition still. I guess I\u2019m back to wearing those ones :/ Here\u2019s hoping someone reaches out about this.", "A few people have complained about the color. On Amazon the pictures aren't very accurate. What I did and I'd recommend you also do, is go to the Sperry website and find the shoe you want and the name of the color, then come on here and order it. You'll save money and won't be surprised about the color Sperry tend to run small, at least for me. I usually wear an 11-11.5 but I wear a 10.5 in Sperry.", "They constanly squeak these are not the same quality as you would get in stores", "I checked \"yes\" on \"good arch support,\" but it is not at all high. My feet don't like high arches, just a little support. These shoes are perfect for that. If you like high arches, they won't work for you. These shoes are well made, not cheesy imitations. My last pair lasted me for years, and these are just as good. Obviously shoes are a very individual taste, but if you like these from the beginning as I do, you can rely on years of good service from them.", "They are a quality brand with an interesting history. Unfortunately they are made out of the country and they don't use American sizes.", "I could not fit my foot in the shoe. The shoe is extremely narrow. My wife thought that it looked like a woman's size and she checked to make sure that I hadn't made that mistake. I wear an 8D (that's regular width) and have never in my life worn anything larger than that. I think I would need a 10 if I was reordering but don't want the hassle of another miss. I have other Sperry's so not trashing them but no way with this shoe.", "Ordered for my son to carry on vacation but when received the shoes was STRATCHED UP VERY BAD!!!! LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE HAD ALREADY ENJOYED THEM AND THE HEELS OF THE SHOE LOOKS AS IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN WALKING ON THE BACK OF THEM. Ordered a size 6.5 but they were too small for his feet not to mention that he was able to get the same shoes and size from Macy's and they fitted him PERFECTLY WITH COSTING HALF OF THE PRICE", "Ver nice Speery (frat boy) shoes, but seem to run about .5-1 size large. I had to buy insoles to make them fit better- helped a lot. Very comfortable soft leather that gets better with age. These shoes are for my son who wears a size 14 or 15! Not easy to find shoes for him, but these are a winner after we put the thick odor eaters inside them (serves a dual purpose- ha!) He wears these barefoot, which looks better than with socks in my opinion. You can get those no show footies- they look like ballerina socks- not real manly though for my college aged son!", "These were a birthday gift for my boyfriend, he wanted something he could wear often in casual settings. These sperrys work very well with causal and dressing up! He loves them.", "I have had a few pairs of Sperry's and always enjoy them because they last and take a good beating. i am not sure if these are fake or quality is has gone way down. I bought these to wear at work and have had them about a month. The sole is already coming off, i wear them maybe 2 to 3 times a week, this is ridiculous, Walmart shoes would hold up better than these.", "These shoes arrived in an order of 3 pairs of shoes. The first pair for great, the second pair fit great, and I assumed then that the third would do the same. Sadly, when I finally wore these, they were way short, and too late to return. My fault? Perhaps, but the size was clearly wrong on the shoe. I haven't ordered from this company since. Paid a lot for nothing. Anyone know where I can get a shoe stretcher?", "I have other Sperry boat shoes and they all are 10.5W or EE and fit me. These that I ordered are not true to size as they were too tight on my instep. Basically the shoe was not wide enough. The good part is, is that Amazon made it easy to return, which I did. I suppose I will have to try ordering a EEE size in the future.", "My husband likes these shoes and has had some before that held up well. While these seemed good at first, he's only worn them 1-2 times per week since he bought them in May and the sole has completely separated from the top of the shoe. It does make me wonder a bit if these aren't authentic.", "This is the second pair that I've had a problem with . The rubber sole has ripped at the front tip. I caught the tip of the shoe on a step and the rubber ripped apart at the stitching. I've had numerous pairs of Sperry boat shoes and never had this problem. I love wearing them, but these last two pair ripped in the same spot within a week of putting them on.", "Sperry Top-Sider Men's A/O 2 Eye Boat Shoe,Tan,7 M...

This time, shoe just seems to be a cheaper and inferior copy. Wouldn\u2019t buy Sperry again. My opinion.", "These were my husband's Christmas present and I was really nervous about buying him shoes over the Internet but we live so far away from shopping regions that I had little choice. Whew! Not only was the color an accurate depiction, but the size was right. He hasn't had them long enough yet, though, to comment on how long they will last. His last pair of deck shoes were made by Bass and they lasted over a decade! (I looked for some of those and Bass has stopped making this kind...maybe they will resume in the future, but until then these should do.)", "I bought these for my husband and they look beautiful, and the leather and stitching is of high quality. The fit is as expected, but my husband did mention that at first the heel area rubbed him some and gave him some blisters, but that eventually went away as the shoe stretched a bit and became more flexible. These shoes are classic and go great with cargo pants, jeans, shorts, and are very versatile.

Only one shoe had the cardboard insert. Box and contents did not appear \"factory new.\" Box said 11 W ( as ordered), but the shoes that arrived were 11 M. The shoes appear to fit okay, so I may keep them. Still undecided. Not happy about getting \"2nd hand/returned goods.\" Somewhere the quality control system is broken or never was. Not at all happy with this kind of service from Amazon or an authorized vendor. One Star for Service, 4 Stars for the quality and price of the shoes.", "Was a good shoe for a week or two then after that they started to come apart. Took them to Macy\u2019s and they said the shoe was and old model not the new one and yet I paid the same price as the new version.", "Soft and supple. Narrow. Look great. But start to stink after a while. Just like women I dated in my twenties. Buy the wide width if your feet aren't skinny skis, otherwise you'll end up walking on the sides of them. Even with those girly liner socks, your feet still sweat in these so get some cedar shoe trees so they stay fresh and the leather doesn't wrinkle while you're not wearing them, you'll thank me later(I accept Amazon gift cards).", "My husband is happy with these, his first pair of Topsiders. They were a tad bit wide but we tightened the laces all the way around and were able to make them fit. He wears them without socks for several hours most days of the week and they broke in quickly. They're not really intended for you to stand or walk in all day, but they're great for puttering around town or the house. They're a nice compromise between sandals vs. shoes-and-socks.", "Been wearing these off and on for years and they never disappoint provided you get the high quality originals and not the cheaper versions they sell in outlet malls. Still have my last pair that are almost my work shoes (and look like it), but wanted to get a nicer pair for no-socks Summer casual.", "I wore this shoe approximately three times on evening social occasions. The fourth time I put it on, the front sole of the right shoe was torn from the toe down about three inches. I have bought many pairs, and currently own and wear four different pairs, colors, and models of Sperrys Topsiders. I have never had this happen before. It's really too bad that the return time has expired. I would think an established company, with a good customer like me, would want to make this right. Chuck Cliggett", "The shoes fit well and are comfortable. The price is a lot lower than what I could find in retail stores.", "The shoe comes without an arch support insert, but the fit was fine. After a couple of days I was able to add an arch support insert thick enough to cushion both heel and ball of foot. Happy now.", "I have warrants Sperry Topsiders for years. I have a long narrow foot and so must buy one of the few models offered and narrow. This order was shipped on time I made shoes are a genuine Sperry Top-Sider what's the best price I have ever seen.", "The rubber outsole becomes hard after a year or two. Makes the shoes extremely slippery and dangerous to wear. Not sure why they would change to such a bad material. Just another company pleasing shareholders while pissing-off customers.", "For the first time, I had to return a shoe for a wide width for my husband. The original size was far too narrow. It was a super easy return. The next pair fit as I expected since the first was too narrow. If you gave ever had to buy a wide width, I highly recommend you do with this shoe. My hubby loves these. I'll update as to how long they lasted. So far he has been a very happy customer.", "I pretty much only wear these shoes, with the exception of running, weddings, or the beach. This has been my 6th or 7th pair of just this color. I have at least three other colors I wear as well. Pros: Fits perfectly every time Perfect without (preferred) or with (not-preferred) socks Comfortable Cons: Come untied like 10 times/day -- soooo annoying Back sole comes loose in about 1/3 of the pairs I've worn -- and that's alot Poor water resistance even with multiple protectant applications", "Do not buy these shoes, they are junk. Sperry cheapened them up by inserting only a partial insole. The insole only covers about half the shoe. After wearing only a couple of times, the insole becomes unglued and starts unraveling. I returned the shoes for a refund. After looking at the reviews again, I see that this is a common problem.", "1 star rating, the pair that I got had the squeaking sound that never went away even after wearing them daily for three weeks! If you get the same on the 1st day, have them replaced/returned immediately!", "The photos speak for themselves. I am extremely disappointed with the SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES these shoes came with. Will definitely be returning them.", "This shoe needs more room for a chance at comfort. It's the first deck shoe I've bought that is rough on the inside. I can't fit them on with socks and they rub the tops of my feet and toes, so I hope I build calluses soon. They look as advertised. I've only had mine for a couple months, so not sure about durability.", "Great shoes, love Sperry's. The first picture, however, is wrong. It is actually just white laces with navy colored base color; the first picture with the brown accents and shoe laces are not the product.", "The soles of these Topsiders broke apart from the leather at the toe end 1 month after the 90 day prime return was up. They were lightly used and only worn to work about half of t he time. Great style, but I expected more and will be trying another brand next time around.", "As usual with shoes on Amazon, I ordered a size that I would buy in a walkin store. WRONG ANSWER. TOO NARROW. I will not purchase shoes from Amazon again.", "got these to use as dress shoes as I have an Achilles tendon strain and these are the only shoes with low enough backs to not put pressure on that area. The black ones work well enough with dark slacks, though not dressy enough for a suit. Also have an older brown pair for khakis and the original brown/tan \"boat shoe\" for wearing with shorts.", "Purchased these shoes for work - they are very nice shoes and I love the design of them. However, when they arrived I was surprised by how red they appeared. They are super nice, and a great quality. The color doesn't match the picture very well - as the picture makes them seem more brown - but the red is not obnoxious, and still matches my clothing well. Love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and I am able to walk around the office all day long without any pain. They have withstood the wear and tear well, and after about 2 years (i think) of wearing them 2-3 a week, they still look great!", "Love the shoes at first, however after just a couple of wears the trim around the toe pealed away. I\u2019ve had Sherry Topsiders before and never had a problem. Very disappointed and will now look to another brand.", "Comfortable and fit is good. Shoes were earing out on my old pair. Leather color has a very lighter tan appearance vs a light reddish brown. Lighter than pictured. Will darken some over time but will still be tan vs light brown.", "Just a poor overall fit. I used to wear this exact same size for 20 years with sperry but not now. Shame.", "I've been wearing Top-Siders forever...probably 50 years now. The quality had fallen off there for a while, but I gotta say this pair is the best I've had in a long time. The insoles are cushiony. I like the finish on this pair and I have actually used shoe-polish for the first time in years and years (remember shoe polish?) to make them look more presentable after beating them up all week. Yeah I will buy this model of Top Siders again..", "Love these shoes. I have owned several pairs and always comeback to these in the summer time. One great thing about these shoes is you can wear them with or without socks and they feel so comfortable. I usually only wear mine without socks. Also without wearing socks most people would worry about smell. These do not put off an odor because of the leather on the inside. My feet sweat terribly and I have not had an issues with these shoes smelling bad. They fit great right out of the box and are true to size. Check out these shoes this summer, you won't regret it.", "Have worn Sperry for years but this pair is definitely not the quality I would expect. They are ready for the trash bin after just 3 months of very light wear. The outer edge of the sole is torn away from the main portion and makes the shoe unwearable.", "I bought these for my son, who loves them. It took a day or so to \"break in,\" and he says they are very comfortable. The fit is just as expected, true to size. He wears them all day long at school, with no complaints. He's only had them a few months, so I cannot speak to how well they will hold up, but I am optimistic given the other reviews. If the shoes do hold up well, and he doesn't grow out of them, I do expect them to last for some time due to the cost.", "These shoes are very comfortable and look good. I wear them without socks. They fit well and are comfortable all day. Even when wearing all day I have never gotten blisters from them.", "Shoes are good enough fit, so I am keeping them. Sperry's I bought years ago were wider and fit better after trying them on at a shoe store.", "This is my second pair of these shoes the last ones lasted about ten years and finally wore out the stitching in the soles. Paid less for these then for the first pair. Good Deal.", "This is the 3rd time I have purchased these shoes. They are comfortable as house slippers or as boat shoes. You decide. They keep my feet warm but the feet never sweat in these shoes. THAT means a lot to your overall comfort.", "Surprised to find this brand at this price. Great fit. Look good. Quick delivery. Well packaged.", "Nice shoes, but the toe of the sole snapped off when I scuffed my foot on some carpet. Now I need to find a new sole and a capable shoe repair shop. I contacted Sperry via social media and they are sending me a replacement pair of shoes.", "Very comfortable. I had to return my first pair because they had a manufacturer's defect in which they squeaked loudly. The replacement pair did not have the same issue; however, the insole peeled back at the ball of my foot, and I had to trim it with scissors. Regardless, it is a very comfortable, attractive boat shoe.", "I have worn Sperry's for years. This is the exact size and shoe that I have had previously. They fit well and they are comfortable aside from the fact that one shoe seems to cause slight irritation after a few hours only on my right foot. I examined the inside of the shoe and the stitching on the interior carries down an extra few millimeters. This makes the right shoe fit more tightly across the top of my foot. They are not quite uniform.", "Nothing will ever beat the feel of a well-worn pair of these on wet and sandy feet after all day surfing.", "Having purchased a fair number of Sperry Topsiders over the years I never had a more ill fitting pair of shoes. My solution is that I hopefully will find some one to give the shoes to that has narrow feet It is too much a hassle to deal with Amazon in any manner. So I do not intend to return them. From this point on I am asking family members to quit sending Amazon gift cards.", "Minimal arch support, a stiff insole helps a lot. But if you are looking at sperry boat shoes you probably know this.", "Don\u2019t know if they were originals or if the quality has really fallen so low. These broke in like 3 1/2 months. My last Sperry top sider lasted 5 years. They are still fine, no issues with soles, just the leather has gone out of shape. Extremely disappointed with the purchase. Won\u2019t buy from amazon for sure.", "I buy a new pair of these every two years. They fit great, are comfortable, and the two tone look goes with any clothes.", "I love all Sperry products and these shoes are amazing. I wear a size 15 and they fit just as expected.", "The shoes are ok. I was just a little disappointed that they weren\u2019t made in the US. I looked at some of there other shoes and seen they where made in the states. So I may not buy this brand again. Thanks for the service.", "Have ordered from this seller several times. Very pleased with the shoes.", "I bought a pair of these 5 or 6 years ago and they were awesome but I lost them last year. I decided to replace them and was very disappointed with the quality. The left shoe is fine, the right shoe appears to be glued in a slightly different spot making them fit differently and the leather on the inside of the right shoe is very rough while the left is not. Not the quality I expected, but I've been wearing them so I can't return them. I put in new insoles which made them a bit better.", "Bought these a month ago to wear while traveling overseas, but was only able to wear twice. Left shoe fits fine, but for some reason the right is very uncomfortable and leaves a red mark on the side of my right pinky toe. Becomes painful after walking for a few minutes, and feels as though the sole is curved or warped in front by ball of my foot, only with the right shoe. The left is completely fine, which is odd since I feel most shoes are typically tighter with the left until broken in. Unfortunately I don't think these will improve over time and I'm two days past the return/exchange date.", "The product was advertised as Sperry Topsiders in Sarah (Leather Color). This shoe is a darker tan leather with a light stitched non slip sole. Typical in the sailing world. What was shipped is a lesser version of the Sperry Topsider in plain tan leather with a brown non marking rubber sole. It does not have the famous Sperry non-slip boating sole. These lesser versions are often found on sale in discount shoe outlets for less money than was paid for this order.", "Very nice shoe. Quality leather and design. My teenage son loves them. He has a narrow heel so they are a little bigger than we thought. He wears a size 8M in men's shoes normally in New Balance, Ralph Lauren, if this is any help.", "This is my 3rd pair of Sperrys. The shoe looks nice, but when I walk, the shoe makes an audible \"whoosh\" sound when I press down on the heel. It's ***very annoying*** and I've tried everything to fix it (replacing the soles, tying it tighter). The only solution is to adjust my step, which obviously is a huge headache. I work in a quiet office and these shoes are basically un-wearable because I am self-conscious of the sound made whenever I step... This has never been a problem with other Sperrys\u2014do not buy Amaretto.", "The shoe I got doesn't match the shoe in the picture . Not comfortable either . If a store was selling at the list price, they go out of business . Stupid ._.", "Flat insole as most boatshoes are! No arch support! Like converse all stars ! Had to put on stretchers for few days with isopropyl alcohol wetting agent , no fit great ! ( put in Dr Sholls arch supports)", "The shoes arrived on time , they fit perfectly and were exactly what I expected to get.", "I bought these for my boyfriend and they fit him well. He used to have a pair in the same color and style, and they lasted several years. Glad he has another pair now, so he has a good quality shoe that works for more casual looks, when his tennis shoes, boots, or dress shoes don't fit the occasion.", "I purchased these Sperry Boat Shoe for my Husband. These boat shoes are the best! I always try to keep a new pair on hand because he wears them all the time. He goes fishing and wears these shoes, he needs a second pair when we go out to dinner, they look better. A great shoes to wear.", "These are my favorite type of casual shoe to wear. They are rugged & last, & always look sporty. This is why I like them. What I don't like is that they are not cheap. I watch for sales & utilize my Amazon points to bring them down to \"Earth\" in price.", "Within a week of wear, the stitching that attached the sole to the toe box tore through the sole, but is still attached to the leather itself. This means the sole is no longer attached to the shoe at the toe box, and the sole outer ring is also coming detached. I'm not sure if buying them at a reputable seller (Nordstrom's or the like) would make a difference, if these shoes are QA rejects or something, but the quality is quite bad.", "I have a hard time believing these are real Sperrys. First time I've ordered a pair that did not come in a branded box, had shoddy branding on the shoe, and worst of all they were coming apart the moment I took them out of the box. Would not recommend this seller or product, my girlfriend ordered a pair this week from a different one and it was a legitimate pair of Sperrys that were made correctly.", "I tried these on in the store (the exact ones) and they fit so comfortably. However, when these arrived from the seller, the soles were completely different and looked as if they have been worn or refurbished! Look was the same (leather was scratched) but the soles were different! Keep in mind that I bought this completely new.", "They fit well and comfortable. I've not had them but a couple or 3 weeks so can't say yet about durability but I think they'll be good. Their nice looking shoe to wear with casual dress pants or jeans and even look good with shorts without socks of course.", "Replacing his worn out decades old pair with an exact replacement. He\u2019s happy; I\u2019m happy!", "I lived on a sailboat from 1982 till 1986. I wore Sperry\u2019s topsiders. Became landlubber in 1988. Retired in 2010. Tried many shoes and boots for 8/9 years. Finally bought some deck shoes again! My feet love me again. Nothing like TRUE Sperry deck shoes. These are the real deal.", "I'll admit that I am a little more than bias, when it comes to this Sperry boat shoe. It's the only style I wear day after day for years. When one pair eventually wears out, I purchase another pair to replace them. I've been doing that for 25+ years. I like them when they are broken in a bit. So I'll order the replacement pair several months ahead of time. I have a couple of other Sperry styles and Converse All-Stars, but these Sperry Original 2 Eye Boat Shoe is the style that gets my pick day after day.", "Perfect fit. True wide width shoes for men are almost impossible to find. Ordered two more pair.", "These shoes made it through multiple vacations, music festivals, camping trips, nights out, you name it. No matter how much damage they took, a quick cleaning made them look brand new. They lasted a full two years with heavy use before I had to take them out of my rotation. This is the perfect all-purpose shoe that looks great, and can take a beating. Due to increased popularity, the price has gone up considerably in the past year. Even at $72, these are still worth every penny. Grab a few pairs of these ASAP.", "I read bad reviews and didn't want to believe them, but I got a lemon... The sole is breaking away from the shoe. Maybe they were priced low because they were factory seconds.... Either way mine had a factory defect which I've never had with other pairs of Sperry's. If they make it right I'll update my review, but as of now I would not buy from this seller again.", "This shoe began to come apart in a big way a little over one month after purchase. The sole began to separate from the body of the shoe at the toe. A real trip fall hazard. Was only worn inside and not subject to heavy usage at all. It really failed and I am outside the return date window by just 4 days. Return deadline May 31, Failure 7/3 . Would not buy this brand again!!!", "Bought these as a gift. I have a pair and had to get a pair for my old man. He was the one who introduced me to loafers but never owned a quality pair. I've had my Sperrys for 6 years now and I had to get him a pair. Love them. Will eventually buy again.", "Not satisfied with the sole of the shoe. Been wearing these brands and atles for many years, did the style of the shoe change real recently?", "I wear a man's size nine, medium, shoe. I have never worn Sperry shoes and I was a bit surprised to see how narrow these shoes were. They did NOT fit my feet. Quite a narrow toe area, fine in back and length. Luckily I was able to use a shoe stretcher, combined with some leather stretching solution (alcohol and water) to open up the toe area. I stretched them a lot. They are okay now but I hope they stretch a bit more from use. Perhaps a wide next time. Never wore a wide shoe in my life.", "The shoe fits . My issue is a very high top arch. I wish the sides over the arch was taller, and the \"toe box wider. I would buy again. 10-1/2 extra wide", "These seem very cheap comparatively to other pairs that I\u2019ve bought at Macy\u2019s or other retail stores. The sole is really flimsy, similar to slippers. I\u2019ll pay the extra 40$ to buy a real pair next time.", "I have heel spurs. Moccasins don't aggravate them. Boat shoes are the closest thing I've found that looks decent and is comfortable to walk in. Still have to add an additional cushion for the heel area though. I asked for double wide shoes having bought them before but a \"helpful\" app popped up on the Amazon site that said some manufacturers sizes varied and changed my request to single extra wide.. and I didn't catch it.", "These are great shoes and my third time purchasing. My boys were required to wear these for their school uniform and they were much more comfortable and better looking than the traditional heavy / dorky uniform shoe alternative. My sons love them.", "Much stiffer than the pair I qanat replacing. Not comfortable", "Comfortable shoe for around the house and boat. I have been wearing and appreciating Sperry A/O's for years.", "Arrived on time. Fit correctly. Have not worn them yet cuz they're our future shoe.", "First shoe I ordered was too big. This company worked with me and exchanged and got my new shoes sent out immediately. Great Shoes!!!", "Shoe has little arch support built in. It feels like walking in a pair of house slippers. The sole looks thick, however, it doesn't feel rigid enough when walking on the sidewalk. The walking surface feels like it is coming thru the sole, which doesn't feel like my feet have any protection. Great looking shoe and great color! It just wasn't comfortable. For my normal shoe size which I ordered, it felt tight and slightly pinched my feet. May need to order a wide width, and not my normal medium width.", "I used amazon to order these shoes as I needed them quickly for an event. I have bought the same exact pair at the local department store and they looked great. The shoes arrived and looked faded.. like they had sat in the sun all summer. Will not recommend to order again.", "Doesn't feel like real Sperry's, I used to own a pair of Sperry's that felt better and more real. It's my first day wearing them and the sole of the shoe is already popping out. Feels like a fake pair of Sperry's. Wouldn't recommend.", "I have been using these shoes for 9 years now, replacing then about every 6 to 8 months with no issue, loved then, but somthing has changed, the last 2 pairs I have gotten have begun to fail almost evidently, they most have changed the rubber they use in the soles because the outer edge just breaks off. Its really a sham, and now I am on the hunt for a new brand", "I was excited to get the \"original\" TopSider style from my teenage years...but they are not the same. The fit is off, toe box is uncomfortably tight and the cut is low. I returned them...:(", "I was very disappointed when I received this package. They came alone in a shipping box, no shoe box, no tissue. They where scratched everywhere as you can see. $100 for shoes that look like they\u2019ve been to hell and back. I ordered from amazon thinking they would be good quality, trying to avoids stores at a time like this but Very bad quality.", "Tough to walk around in for a long time but amazing otherwise. Really well made.", "excellent value for the price. with free shipping and no tax I really saved. I recommend, but for me these shoes were a bit large. I was able to put in a foam shoe pad and that helps to make them fit right.", "I have been wearing Topsiders for decades - just love the look and especially the feel when they have been broken in. Some pairs come a little larger and some a little smaller than my size - I have no idea why. Once I have worn them for a while and the leather has stretched, it's like walking barefoot. At first, the only discomfort is the upper-back rubbing the tendon. When the leather has stretched, the rating goes to five stars.", "Ordered for my husband he loves them and says they\u2019re very comfortable!", "Purchased these as a gift for my husband. He has a narrow foot so I thought the narrow size would be a good option. He could have swam in them and to top it off one of the metal rivet eyelets was already popped off. When I went to return them due to the defect I found that there was a 30 day return policy. Guess I am going back to buying shoes at Zappos instead!", "I really like these Sperrys however this particular color seems to scuff easily. Very comfortable overall. I usually wear a 9.5 but I ordered a 9 because I know they run a bit large. Will buy again but a different color", "the shoes are not like those of years ago. The quality has decreased.", "Very comfortable Moc type shoe. The best I've ever worn.", "The shoes arrived as schedule and as described in the picture, I really like those shoes, they are very light and comfortable, the only thing worth saying to anyone interested in buying them if that they fit half a size smaller. I usually need 10.5 but for that specific model, I needed a 10 men size, or maybe it is because I do not wear socks with those shoes. Anyways, I hope this hepls. I would definitely recommed this product and this seller to anyone out there.", "Small size and poorly blown! After long wearing the foot sweats And so cute, but the price compared to the quality is greatly overstated", "Good looking, well made shoe, especially for a beach wedding, but I have blisters on the bottom of my feet as well as on the outstep of my feet. I spent a few days breaking in the shoes and I'm still limping a bit. the pad in the bottom of the shoe has a TERRIBLE seam, that blistered the bottom of my feet. The shoe tapers in too much on the outside so I had constant rubbing on my \"Pinky\" toe. Not for the Flat footed.", "I'm not sure these are actually authentic. Bought these and they looked slightly off. Even my husband, who only wears Sperry's, didn't think they were the real thing. Be weary.", "I've had plenty of Sperry's in my day, but these did not seem to live up to their previous track record. The first day I wore them the insert on the left foot came loose and would bunch up causing it to be quite annoying to wear. I would constantly have to take the shoe off and flatten it out. After a few days wear I've noticed it's not quite as bad, but if I had the time to do it I would've returned them for a different pair because these are generally a good, versatile shoe that's just easy to slip on and go.", "I have had a pair of these Top-Siders for over 10 years, and bought these to replace the older ones. I simply ordered the same pair I have, and what I got was exactly the same - a testament to Sperry's consistency over time. Of course the new ones are pristine, and the old ones are scuffed, stretched, and darkened from repeated coatings of Neatsfoot oil, but still very serviceable. I wear the old ones as house shoes for lounging at night after a shower.", "These are just as expected. A slightly snug fit out of the box will loosen with some time. These are replacing an old pair that are now worn out.", "As expected, Sperry's are always the top of the line in casual boat/deck shoes. Have had 5-6 pairs in succession that have always given great service. Usually by the time the soles wear out the uppers are so broken in that I don't want to give them up. They break in very quickly and within a month can be worn without socks. Shopped several stores bu couldn't find the price I liked. Amazon vendor had the ones at the right price and delivered before predicted. Winner all around!", "I normally wear anywhere from a 12 to 13 depending on the type of shoes and these 12\u2019s are huge. I love the quality and aesthetics of these shoes however, they are extremely uncomfortable and I am not sure that is from the size or the leather.", "Shipping came quickly and this shoe lasts pretty well for what I bought it for. Only annoying thing is that after a few months, the inside of the soles started coming up but I just glued them back down with some gorilla glue and it works just like new again. Initially, the fit is a little small but that's expected with leather shoes. After about 2 weeks of wearing them, they stretched out to the expected size of most sperry's.", "I ordered a trusted spring / summer shoe I've been wearing for the past 33 years. Goes with any clothing style from shorts to jeans to Friday business casual, any time of day., always stylish and comfortable. Will order the Sperry Top Sider again when these wear out!", "I've read a lot of reviews of lower quality, but these seem to be exactly what I wanted. I'm on my feet a fair bit for work, and while I wouldn't walk for miles and miles in these, they're certainly comfortable enough for a days work moving around a good bit. I definitely plan to order again in the future as needed.", "These are the wear everywhere, all day, feel great shoes. They look good in any casual situation. I maintain three pair. One pair is new-ish for casual \"events.\" One is medium old for wearing around the house and going to town. One pair is old for wearing for rough work. When the oldest pair gets too worn, I buy a new pair and shift the other two to the other functions.", "I ordered these shoes in addition to the classic brown Sperry pair I bought several years ago. The quality of the shoes are high and it's comfortable to wear them. The actual colour of the shoes is a bit lighter than on the pictures but I like it better. The carton I received via UPS was damaged but the shoes were in safety. That's all I can say after a few days of wearing the shoes. Those who order delivery to Russia should be prepared to present some docs for customs.", "I had the same pair back in highschool that got stolen and I had to buy them when I saw they were only 57 dollars. When I bought them before, they were 99", "The left shoe \"squeaks\" ( more like a whistle) as if there is a pocket of air or something that is being squeezed out and re-filled every time I take a step. It's embarrassing. I've had these for a few months now and have given them light to moderate wear. The problem still persists. I emailed Sperry's customer service after a month of buying it regarding this matter, however, they kindly declined to exchange my product.", "good all around shoes. the first pair i got as a gift in 1983. they lasted till 2003. the next pair last from 03 till 15. not as long as the first, but in all fairness, i did wear the send pair much more often than the first. comfortable (i can walk 10 km without any soreness) and fitting to wear at any casual event. i carry a second pair in my vehicle along with extra socks, pants, shirts and jacket.", "Great shoes hoe they last as long as my other pair\u2014- 16 years", "These are what my son wears. He should be wearing a 12 1/2 because a 13 is too big, but since they don't come in his size he is now breaking in the size 12.

I just wish big-foots like me and my son didn't have to settle for the wrong size. Apart from that, it is a good quality shoe!", "Definitely runs small. My husband bought a similar pair and a 13 fit perfectly. He couldn't get his foot in these ones. We will be returning.", "Not the slip on shoe shown in the picture. The one I received has laces that have to be tied. Also it's extremely dark navy blue.", "I do not recommend buying this from Amazon. I started wearing these about 2 weeks ago, and they make a horrible whistling/squeaking noise! It I had bought these in store, I could have picked one that didn't make this sound but since I bought it online I had no way to test it until I decided to wear them. Style wise they are nice, but who wants to wear a shoe that will making noise everywhere you go?", "I guess the price went up since I ordered mine. Nice shoes but I would not pay the new price $84.99", "What else can I say about these shoes that hasn't been said before? These are the best casual shoes one can wear during the summer time. They look great with chinos or shorts, super sharp. You can find them here cheaper than the store. A+++", "The first pair was too small so I returned them, and reorder a larger pair, which was sent from a different supplier. They were too big, and when I tried to return them, I found out that I had to pay $15 for the return shipping... thanks a lot Prime!!", "What can I say, the classic is still as amazing as it ever was.", "love it!!! it was a little tight - took about 1 week to break i (wore it with some socks too around the house).the laces on it easily come untied a lt. had to superglue it together. hasn't budged since, and absolutely love it!", "I have worn topsiders shoes for 25 years- So easy just to slip on and off, with no tying required. This purchase was to replace ones that wore out after many years. Love this color. They last for years in my experience. Fortunately for me I can walk in these for long distances without a problem. To me they are very comfortable. The leather on this latest purchase appears slightly different in texture than the old pair. Hope they hold up like the old ones did!", "Bought these as a gift for my dad and he loves them!", "I wouldn't say that these are the same quality topsider I wore back in the 1980's but they are pretty close. I got the black pair and they fit as expected and look great. I would definitely recommend purchasing these.", "Fit perfect , looked great and a very comfortable shoe. Love them", "Traditional boat-shoes. Fit great & last for years. More comfortable as they age. Replacing a pair that I\u2019ve had for 8 years.", "Ordered these for boyfriend. He thought they were going to be too stiff but was pleasantly surprised. He says they are very comfortable!", "I love boat shoes, and I only wear Sperry brand. This is the first time I have purchased them in the Sahara color. I really like the color and they have weathered very well. The best thing about Sperry boat shoes, and these in particular, is that there is no break-in period. Don't worry about putting these on and getting blisters for the first couple of days. They are as comfortable as slippers, day one.", "I've been wearing way too many sperrys these days. Sizing seems to be very consistent among different sperry styles. I bought the brown/buck brown from Amazon. FYI, I don't know if the nubuck handles rain very well so I just wear these on sunny days. EDIT: Stitching fell apart in the toebox of both shoes after 2 months of minimal wear for the Brown Buck / Brown colorway. My other sperry's have lasted far longer.", "I've owned Sperry Topsiders for almost 40 years. They have always been one of the best quality shoes I've ever had. However, this pair that I purchased six months ago is falling apart. No longer worth the money.", "As you can see in the pics attached, I received these shoes with several scuffs and scratches on them. Almost as if they had been worn. Even though it was a great price, I can't justify keeping them as they are now. Will most likely be returning.", "Shopping for shoes online works if your familiar with the brand and the size correlation. Im normally a 12 in Nike but in these i had to purchase a couple times and send returns to get it right. Ended up needing a 11.5 EE Frustrating but i got what i wanted in the end and I'm happy with it! I", "The material scratches very easily - I would definitely recommend Sperry boat shoes in general but not in this particular leather.", "I read reviews that touted the value of buying the original. They were right. Theses shoes are comfortable, look good, fit right, and are built to last. I expect to wear these shoes for the next 10 years.", "Initially ordered 10.5M but needed to exchange for an 11M. I normally wear size 10.5 in most shoes, but they were a bit narrow and short, so I returned them and almost opted for 11M EE but they were out of stock and I went for the regular size 11. The new ones came after an extremely easy \"return and order new\" in lieu of \"exchange\" and fit perfectly. Highly recommended - expect these ones to last at least as long as my last pair that I had for 6 years.", "Loved this shoe when it first arrived on June 4th. They have been worn FOUR times and the sole detached from the shoe itself. We have been a Sperry family for years, so this was a HUGE disappointment. Asking for a replacement and hope that pair lasts for years like all the other pairs ever owned.", "As with everything these days, the order took a little longer than normal. The shoe is great quality although I always wear a medium width and boat shoes. The pair is a little narrower than normal but I know they stretch.", "These are my all time favorites, fourth pair in years!", "shoes are a little too narrow for my feet, good looking , classic look, nostalgic shoes as I had many pairs of them in the 80s, good summer shoes, they are not designed for long walking, my feet hurt after about 20 minute of walking, bought them as nostalgic shoes ;)", "Fits perfect I feel like I can run fast in these shoes if I had to. Just looks smaller on the feet compared to other shoe of the same size.", "These apparently run big but didn't realize until he had already pitched the box. Had to put away in closet and wait to grow into them. Quality, color, etc is great.", "Great fit even with my wide feet comfortable and stylish", "Love these shoes but too big to keep them so we had to return.", "My husband wears a pair of these every day and has been for many any years. His old ones finally fell apart. They were out of stock everywhere and I suggested that he check Amazon. They had his size and the color he wanted. It was supposed to be delivered a week later but actually they came in just a few days. They fit perfectly and are really good quality. He's very happy with them.", "If you like moccasins these are great. Not as casual looking and when newer, acceptable for an evening outing on a sailing yacht. No arch support so don't expect these to be good for walking around Manhattan. Good with light socks but best without! They may discolor a bit after being wet if the water is not really clean or they are not given a chance to dry out of the sun.", "I love these shoes and have been wearing them almost daily since purchasing them almost 6 months ago. They are comfortable (extremely!) and easy to slip on and off. They match with almost anything I wear which is a bonus. I will say whatever is coating the inside of the shoe sort of melted away and clumped up, turning some of my socks brown at first, though this eventually went away. I will definitely be buying another pair of these if and when my current pair bites the dust.", "Really Comfy and nice but I received the wrong color. I ordered white and received ICE an off white tan color. I'm leaving on a cruise and cannot switch them out for the right color. I'm still pretty happy and I can still wear off white/tan just won't match as well. The shoes arrived 2 days after ordering, which is awesome!", "Went to Macy\u2019s and they didn\u2019t have in stock! Pulled out my phone and ordered and received exactly what I wanted in 2 days in Hawaii! Merry Christmas", "This is a great boat shoe. I got my husband a size smaller than he wears because these shoes S T R E T C H. Can't go wrong with this brand.", "This pair of Sperry's is probably my 10th pair that I have owned. The disappointing quality of this pair is magnified by the fact that the right front isn't stitched close to the edge of the front sole. The toe leather buckles and folds and I can feel the extra room/flap as I walk. Is it just that Sperry is producing too many of these that quality control is overlooked?", "My husband LOVED these shoes!!!!! He still wears them over five years later and they are still looking good as new :-) highly recommend", "It\u2019s Sperry! Living in Annapolis that\u2019s all you wear and have never had a bad pair! Like all Sperrys they have a 3-5 day break in period but highly recommend!", "Great shoe at a great price. Have not worn them much yet. They feel great on my feet. Looking them to wear casually and not daily so I am expecting a long life. We shall see.", "My husband said quality was what was expected , but the color was lighter than he thought. He ordered a 12, but thinks he should have ordered an 11.5.", "Second pair I've ever owned and fit hasn't changed; however, I had to add a piece of double-sided tape under each insole to secure the insole to the shoe. Otherwise, bare feet would pull the insole out of the shoe when you remove your foot.", "Liked the color, fit and looks. I wear them from condo to pool and when wearing shorts/casual dress pants in warm weather.", "I could wear these shoes every day, and pretty much have since I bought them. I definitely recommend these shoes. They can go casual or even pair with khakis.", "Classic topsiders are always my go to casual shoe choice - they have been my choice for the past 40+ years and they continue to please - classic look and fit.", "LIKE THAT AMAZON HAS THEM AVAILABLE. THANKS AMAZON LOVE YA", "I returned these shoes, and bought from another store, there were typos on the tongue, size was completely off, and there was air getting trapped in both shoes which made swooshing noises when I walked (like squeezing a ketchup packet). Other pair I bought fit much better with no air getting caught under the sole.", "Always great quality from Sperry Men's Boat Shoe. Great fit and light.", "The white molding around the base of the foot, at the front near the toes have started to peel off. less than 30 days after arrival and wear of shoes! This has happened to both shoes left and right. Very horrible and shotty construction of these shoes. Do not buy! These are either fakes, or just horribly made.", "These shoes fit true to size. They are comfortable and function exactly as expected.", "have bought them in the past and will do so again", "This was my first boat shoe and I've been buying the same color Evey 2-3 years since 05. I also have different colors but this one is my favorite. I really want to try the \"gold cup\" $300+ Sperry's ...but I've never spent more then $150 on boat shoes ...", "Have worn these for several weeks now and they perform as expected. These have the leather laces, which I prefer over the cloth type other boat shoes have. One trick I use is to glue the knot with superglue to keep them tied.", "I bought for my husband size 9.5 and it was perfect, they measure 30 cms, the color is navy with white leader cord. The brand is on sole, back, right and into the shoes. I recommend that product for their quality and its the same on the picture.", "Couldn't find the shoes that tie, only the slip on ones. Didn't look like real Sperry that he and I love.", "Bought these for my husband. He\u2019s worn these boat shoes for years-tried,tested & true he says with 40 yrs of boating under his belt. They\u2019re well made & classic looking", "I have have had three pairs of these since 1980. The last a long time. The are durable comfortable and even takes my prescribed insoles and my foot.", "These are replacing a pair of 30 year old Topsiders that have just worn out. The right shoe had suddenly fit too short for some reason, so it was too uncomfortable to wear. I'm leery of buying any kind of clothes for myself online as I'm hard to fit, but these replacements turned out alright if slightly tight. Hopefully it's just new shoe syndrome and they looosen up as they're worn longer. I use them around the house where I wouldn't go in just socks, like the cellar or porch or front yard.", "I\u2019ve worn Sperry Top-Siders before they became a fashion statement for the medical field. The two eyed boat shoe has been my favorite casual shoe for 30+ years. My only problem was the leather laces coming untied. I learned to do a Celtic knot with barrel knots on the end and I\u2019ve been happy ever since. On occasion I\u2019ve bought other and have been disappointed every time.", "You really can't go wrong with Sperrys but these fit a tad large and are pretty heavy, compared to other Sperrys I've had. Regardless, they look good and never stink, even when wearing sockless (which is more typical IMO).", "Shoes arrived with cracked leather, split sole and a partially broken lace. Seller response was essentially \"tough luck\". These also run much larger than my other sperry top-sider a/o 2 eyes, which I suppose may be an older model. I guess if it wasn't for all these issues they would be fine shoes, for the money.", "This is probably my 9th pair of sperrys. 2nd or third through amazon. This last pair broke down so fast it\u2019s almost as if it was a fake. The eyelets fell out and the shoe looks like a sponge", "Too often the leather laces break and the lace eyes come out of the leather while the rest of the shoe is still useable. Recent pairs also cracked through the soles.", "the sole tore off. sperry replaced it, no hassle. for the $ and reputation, i wouldnt expect this to happen. they boys were being rough though. i am sure to buy more sperry though since its the go to brand - for my kids", "Looked everywhere for this shoe...worth it! My husband loves the look and wear off this shoe.", "Needed a wide width but still you never know, these fit perfect ! very true to size. Had bought Dockers but these are superior by far.", "The size explanation was a little off. I could have used the 2e not the 3 e. But they shrank a little after i got the wet.", "The second pair came without any scratches as far as I know. You really need those true no-show socks that barely covers your ankles, otherwise you look silly.", "The shoe always fits comfortable right out of the box. Got them at $68, which a good price! Very happy with the purchase.", "I bought a pair each in the Amaretto and Sahara colors. The Sahara felt softer than the Amaretto but more easily scuffed. No issues with the stitching or squeaks. I would buy again when needed.", "I\u2019ve loved the sperry topsider I\u2019ve had quite a few in my lifetime, not new to me", "People complaining about quality changing. I don't see it. A close look and mine are same as last.", "Great shoe as expected. I only wear them for leisure so I cant speak to durability but I have had many other sperrys and they all seem to last as long as any other shoe would given the conditions.", "Liked how it was manufactured. I wanted them in navy perhaps I hit wrong color button.", "Classic Top-sider styling in an unusual but understated color combination. The burnishing is very subtle, so don't worry about the shoe being either worn looking or too shiny. If the description hadn't pointed out the burnishing, honestly I wouldn't have realized it was a \"feature.\" A nice fun plus was the tartan plaid lining -- cool-looking and comfortable.", "My husband loves his old fleece-lined cowhide moc-style slippers so much he wishes he could wear them all the time. So, I got him Sperrys for Fathers Day. Right out if the box the leather is soft and supple. He has an average width foot. 11's are a teeny bit big for him but he tells me they feel so good, he just snugged up the laces a bit and declared the problem solved. He's a runner with sore feet and picky about shoes, so if he likes these, it says a lot.", "Haven't really been able to wear them; the width was kist too small for me (got the biggest width available). Love the styling on them, am going to try to stretch them out to see if I can wear them comfortably. Construction is very good, and they are quite stylish, so hopefully will be able to wear them. Would recommend, just make sure you get the correct size. :)", "The shoes are lighter than expected, they look like were used, and the back looks in a good condition but they don\u2019t look \u201cNew\u201d as the description. I bought US10.5 cuz i had another Sperry like this, but this one fit a little bit small", "I was very excited to receive these shoes. Put them on and they were comfortable right out of the box. Unfortunately the second day trying to wear them, a piece of the insole that does not extend to the toe is rolling up right under the ball of my foot. I have to take the shoe off try to flatten this and put the shoe back on...can I glue it? Not really sure I want to ruin an $80.00 pair of boat shoes on the first week. When these are cooperating, they are the most comfortable shoes I own, I just wish I did not have to fight them.", "Very nice shoes, good quality, weren\u2019t uncomfortable when I first got them. Really good buy if you can get it sub $100.", "I've worn these shoes for decades and now, all of a sudden, a 9M is 8-1/2M. The leather's not quite the same, either.", "fits well. was not expecting arch support for this type shoe", "So far so good. The quality seems to be just as good as the ones I just replaced that I bought seven years ago.", "I have always worn 10.5 W shoes and have a closet full of them. However, though I ordered and received a 10.5 W in this shoe it is way too small. If I were to order this shoe again (and I won't) it would be in a 11W. It is really that much smaller than true size. I am returning them for a refund.", "One of the eyelets popped off. Needed a slim size in this color.", "I had to return mine because the sides were just too loose, although the length was perfect for a size 10", "I wanted the dark sole so I bought the light leather and dyed them. BE CAREFUL if you haven\u2019t dyed leather before", "This is at least my 2nd pair. I love the way they fit and feel. I wear them everywhere! They arent just for the boat.The last pair was a gift from my son and daughter-in-law. So comfortable they are my first pick each day which can be a problem because they can get ugly fast... rather embarrassing at times when going out so I bought this pair for going out on the town.", "I had always wanted a pair of Sperry's and wanted this versatile colour that would go well with both black and dark brown. The shoes seem sturdy and well made. I wear them without socks and I find them comfortable for walking and standing over long periods. My only concern is that on the left foot the laces are too long and on the right foot the laces are too short. I wish they came the same length.", "I've worn these comfortable shoes for years. People with narrow feet like mine find our choices to be somewhat limited. I think it's great that these come in a C width! They are perfect, year-around shoes for Florida, and are great with or without socks. I highly recommend them!", "Love Sperry Top-Siders and have been wearing them for years. I have three other pairs in various stages of \"breaking in\" and decided it was time for a fresh pair before I am forced to retire my older pair. I found these to be much too narrow and tight. I have always worn a size 13 in the original boat shoe but discovered that I had to go with a 13 wide for a comfortable fit. I find it odd that all my previous pairs have been 13's but now I have to order a wide. Maybe my foot has grown in the past year or maybe Sperry has changed their manufacturing.", "Like the leather Sperry Top-Sider. Fit is good and comfortable. A little break-in is all that is needed for the leather. :-)", "Fit as expected, getting the usual great quality of Sperry. if you are new to Sperry though, just be warned that because they are leather, they do take a bit of breaking in, but after maybe a few days, you'll be fine.", "These blue leather Sperry boat shoes will go good with some of my Summer outdoor apparel, I also own a dark brown pair. I like.", "Love the color and texture. They fit tightly right now, but I know in time they will loosen up and be very comfortable.", "The shoes that I just bought and received from Amazon shipment have gaps between the joint lines. The product quality is quite poor. I have to rerun it.", "Great casual shoes replacing a pair from a while ago and showing wear. The new ones, same as old pair, are soft leather and comfortable. And at a good price.", "The product is really good. At first, I though the shoes didn't fit me adequately but after two or three uses I think the shoes fits good, so to point out only that for people from outside of US (like me) would be nice to have a centimeters reference, not only comparisons between Europe or UK sizes.", "Bought these shoes a second time after spilling paint on the first pair I owned the first pair for over 4 years and they barely showed any signs of wear these shoes are super comfortable and are my favorite shoes by far", "Hmm..not up to the old quality Sperrys. The interior piece of shoe only goes halfway, not all the way to toe, & is peeling up after only a few day's of wearing. The sewing is pretty shoddy and had to clip off some interior thread knots that were rubbing. They'll do for the Summer but doubt they will survive much beyond that. Disappointing for almost $90.", "The black with tan is a versatile shoe for a teenage boy. The black makes it pass as dressy enough with a sports jacket and tie. We've bought this style before and it fit one size smaller than Nikes do. This time half size smaller would have been better.", "Just a note this style runs narrow. I have bought other Sperry's shoes and had no issues with size 9.5 (US). It is actually what I wear practically every day. However, this one I could not even get my foot in the size 9.5. Sperry quality is good and the show looked well made, so would recommend if it fit you.", "This was an amazing price for Sperry boat shoes. I was looking to replace my old pair that I had been using for the past 2.5 years (there was a good period of several months where I wore them everyday). However, when buying these shoes, be sure you've tried on and walked around in boat shoes before. Sperry boat shoes are notorious for having low arch support and personally, I cannot comfortably walk in them for more than a couple hours. That's just how Sperry's are. Nonetheless, these are authentic/good quality for a great price (normal msrp between $80-100).", "When you order a 4E, you expect a EEEE. But no, these are regular width. When you have Fred Flinstone feet, you cannot wear a regular width. Extremely disappointed!", "I owned a pair of these prior to me buying these, but my dog chewed up the left foot and unfortunately you can't just replace a left foot! I ended up getting three different colors of the same style because I am so happy with them. They are comfortable, casual, but you still don't feel like a schmuck in a business casual environment. You can go socks or no socks (if you go socks, don't go white socks).", "Bought these for my son. He likes them and wears them often. I have a similar Sperry shoe and on both pairs, his and mine, the same steel grommet came loose on the outside left shoe after little wear. Disappointing because I have been a Sperry customer for many years. Still love the shoes just wish they held up like they used to.", "I ordered a size 10. I usually wear 10 or 10.5. They are way too big I can't wear them. Amazon will only take them back rather than replace them. I ordered them because I got a great price. Now I would have to pay more on a smaller size. Terrible customer service if you ask me.", "These shoes are great. The leather is soft, the stitching is robust, and overall the construction feels durable. The new leather smell right out of the box was fantastic. The actual color is slightly deeper and richer than depicted in the picture. I would describe it as closer to the color of a baseball glove. Fit is true to size, but it will be a little snug at first until the leather conforms to the shape of the foot.", "Sperry, what has happened to you. You were once the best. The left shoe was too small. The right shoe was even smaller. The quality of construction was the worst I have seen in a shoe. The leather inside was of very poor quality. I will go with Sebago's instead.", "The shoe fits as you'd expect. Mine got a nice brown patina over time, I think they look pretty sweet. This is actually my second pair, in the same color. My previous pair lasted aroud 4 year before they started to wear through. That was mostly my fault though, as I did get a lot of salt water on them during the winter. If these last me another 4 years, I'll definitely get another pair.", "I typically only wear sperrys. This is a replacement pair that I purchased because the first one fell apart quickly. Now this pair is falling apart. The inside sole separates from the sole of the shoe. They\u2019ve gone cheap on us or they are knock offs. Buyer beware!", "This shoe fit to size and width. Sturdy, yet soft. Comfortable to wear with or without socks. My husband hates shopping so the ease of ordering on-line was wonderful. He is very happy with his new shoes.", "Very comfortable for work, fit as expected. Will buy again", "Great boat shoes , except the sizing. I\u2019m wearing 10,5 but had to buy 11,5. 10,5 were too small", "I always wear a size 12 medium width. These were too small. My toe was crushed up against the front of shoe and also felt too narrow. Sent them back. Ordered size 13. They do not come in size 12-1/2. Ordered size 13, hopefully they will not be too big.", "The stitching on the front of the shoe that connects the upper to the sole has fully come out. Only wear on weekends. Even if that weren't the case, a three month lifespan is a disgrace. Cant even get a full a season out of these poor quality shoes. They did fit though! Of course now I'm out $100 and a pair of shoes. Being ripped off is not a good feeling. Thanks guys!", "Have worn Top-Siders forever. No telling how many pairs I've had. This one, however, feel apart prematurely. NEVER experienced that with Top Sider ... EVER. And I've worn them into salt water ... you name it. The soles separated from the upper.", "If you've ever worn Sperrys you know they have no arch support, so if that's an issue you'll need an insole. I usually wear a 15, but wear a 14 in Sperry. They're a little wider then a normal shoe, or maybe it just seems that way since they aren't tight on the top. I usually wear them without socks, but Sperry does make socks that don't slip off the heel that won't show with the boat shoe. Also, for being a leather shoe that you wear in the summer without socks they somehow seem to avoid becoming stinky- a big bonus!", "Amazing shoes. Great fit. Comfortable. Leather looks amazing. Love that I can clean it really easily. Definitely recommend to everyone. Update: 3 years after purchase, amazing shoe. The leather is so durable and just now have I started to see wear on these shoes. I've brought these shoes through hell. The blizzards of NY in the winter and the summers in Bermuda. This shoe lasts and looks great.", "My son loves this shoe comfortable, he wears it every where.", "The shoes are standard sperry shoes, great product all around, but what makes these even better is the price is better than my local outlet store!", "I love this shoes... have to replace them every other year or two, because I wear them almost every day (except during the winter).", "I typically am a 9 1/2 - 10 and had to return my initial pair as the 9 1/2 I ordered were far too large. 9s are just about right but still feel slightly loose in the heel, which I think might be normal since they're loafers. I've been wearing them for one full day and they are VERY stiff, which I hear is normal but should be said. I've gotten several blisters just from the first day. I think they'll be great once they get broken in I just didn't expect the size or stiffness quirks.", "This is a great shoe. The fact that it is much cheaper than my local retail was a bonus.", "My first pair lasted me 5 years of real heavy use. This pair lasted a week before what you see in the picture happened. Maybe just a bad unit off the factory line. Maybe they're just trash in the interest of making more money faster \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I'm past the Aug 17 return date and now the insoles have become dislodged and stick to my feet and come up out of my shoes. This is nothing like the shoes I've purchased from Sperry over the last 3 decades. I'll never buy Sperry again.", "This is the third pair of Sperrys i buy for my son. He wears them with chinos when snickers and jeans are not appropiate enough. i only would like how to clean them.", "Looses one star because they don't fit like they did five years ago. Wide is no longer wide and they seem just slightly shorter for 9 1/2. Edit: I actually ordered three times. Finally 10 wide is the trick. I never order size 10, so this is just wrong. I hope the quality is still there.", "Sole and insole both fell apart after only a couple months. Sperry use to make good products, but they have become complete crap.", "As others have posted, the insole eventually comes unglued. I purchased these in December and it took 4 months of sparse use for this to occur. I also have an issue with the stitching digging into the top of my right foot making these incredibly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. For the money, absolutely not worth the hassle.", "Not a lot to say about these. bought them as a gift for someone. got them in a 10.5. He says they fit perfect, and they're beautiful. He seems to be a pretty happy camper. I myself have come to love these slip on style loafer/boat shoes so i may have to try out a pair of sperry's myself now. I have a couple DC's but i hear these are so much more comfortable.", "Nice looking shoes, comfortable fit, but they squeak when you walk! Unfortunately I waited too long and it's outside of the return window. I would have thought Sperry would be more customer-centric. First pair that I bought. I'm not sure I'd buy another pair. Maybe these were knock-offs?", "My son is happy with the shoes and I'm happy with the price and fast delivery!", "I may have set my sights too high as replacement shoes for a different brand I had worn out. The shoes I was replacing were about the same price but had better quality materials and stitching.", "What's not to like they are Sperrys. Very comfy. Perfect, classic, great looking.", "Shipping was quick, quality of the shoe seems very good. But it is just a little tight. I thought I was getting a wide shoe, but it doesn't seem all that wide. However, it isn't so uncomfortable that I will have difficulty stretching them out.", "This was well worth the chance I took when I ordered it! My son who is away at college, called to say he needed something comfortable to wear around campus, but due to his rather hectic schedule (exams and soccer) did not have the time to trudge to the mall. We decided to take a chance and order the selected pair online. Delivery was quick and my son is extremely pleased at what he received. The shoes are just what was shown online and the fit, which we worried a bit about, was true to size (11 M). In addition, he says they are extremely comfortable and has been making good use of them!", "I HAVE ALWAYS WORN THESE SHOES... THIS PAIR STATES IT IS (XW) ... I ALWAYS GET XW... I HOPE THEY STREACH OUT.. THEY EVEN LOOK LIKE THEY ARE NOT WIDE AT ALL. THE BOX SAYS XW BUT NO MARKINGS ON OR IN THE SHOES ( ALL MY OTHER SPEERY'S HAVE SIZE PRINTED INSIDE ) TO STATE SIZE. I EVEN PUT NEW SHOES TO OLD SHOES (SOLE TO SOLE) NOT THE SAME OLD SHOE IS WIDER . I DO NOT SEND ITEMS BACK CAUSE I HAVE TO PAY RETURN SHIPPING, ADDING TO THE COST OF THE SHOE ( YA THATS ON MY ) OH WELL LIVE AND LEARN.", "This is my first pair and they seem pretty decent quality. I went with a wide size and I'm glad I did.", "Been wearing Sperry's for 30 plus years. Got these last year, wore them for 2 month of summer and pulled them out again.. falling apart already.", "OK. My son hates shoes. He's lived in converse sneakers or skate shoes all his life. For him, these were a step up. He wears them everywhere. They are easy to clean, and because they are not shiny, don't show wear as much (no polishing required). He has relatively flat feet and finds them comfortable. These were a replacement for ones he wore out -- he loves them!", "Not the advertised item. May he fake. Oatmeal color advertised with leather laces, as the original should be, but delivered with synthetic laces. Also has a defect in the insole that can be felt while wearing. Am returning the shoe.", "So they look great but he can feel something weird in the heel , like when he steps down he feels something inside of it. Strange", "I thought I got a great deal on these shoes, but was suspicious of quality, based on the low price ($60). Unfortunately after only 6 months the sole came apart at the seam. Not sure if these are factory defects that were resold at a discount or I just got unlucky, but at $85 I will definitely not be purchasing again.", "I really like these, they fit well. This is my third pair, I have worn the previous two over many years so much that the soles eventually wore out, not surprised given how often they were worn. The arch support is not great, you can wear them more than a couple of hours comfortably, but I wouldn't go out for a long multi-mile walk with them. Great in the summer!", "I think the size they are selling is a little bit bigger I got a size 9 but it fits like a 10. FYI when buying, this one runs a little bit bigger", "I had to reorder the first one due to small for size recommend for growing kids order 1/2 to 1 size bigger they run small for actual foot size this was for my 14yr old you no there picky but they look great he loved them coming from a Nike kid only that was great deal and they arrived just in time for Easter! He actually said he\u2019d were them to school!!", "a little pricey and they leave my feet stained blue sometimes. not sure if other colors do this. my girlfriend has tan and brown pairs and does not have this issue. not sure if it is something with the coloring or if i needed to soak them like many reviews suggest. other than the blue feet issue i like them a lot.", "Nice casual shoes. Take a little bit to break in, but very comfortable once they do. I personally prefer to wear them with no show socks as I don't like it when my feet start to sweat right up against the leather. I wear size 10.5 in Nikes and most other shoes but a 10 fit me well in these.", "It's difficult to find shoes for my husband's small (but wide) feet. These were a nice fit and after he wore them for different lengths of time they molded right to his feet and were comfortable. They are genuine Sperrys---real leather. It was nice to find them here at such a good price.", "I really enjoy my Top-Siders. I can wear them with very casual (trunks and a T) to resort attire (chinos and collard shirt). They are comfortable and fit well. If I could improve one thing with this shoe it would be the insole lining. The leather insole lining only covers half of the insole and starts to peel up and curl mid-foot as you wear the shoes more.", "Couldn't find the tan and white color anywhere expect Amazon. Not only did Amazon have every color but I experienced the best prices I have seen on here. Very happy with this shoe still holding up after 13 months of usage. Great with jeans and shorts. Next time I buy Sperry's I'm going to get them on Amazon.", "The shoes were very squeaky. Every step I took they would squeak. They also faded in color after normal use. I only had them for a few days and had to return them because they had faded to an entirely new color and were scratched all over and wouldn\u2019t stop squeaking. I honestly don\u2019t think these are authentic or Sperry has just completely dropped in quality recently", "Classic style. You don't need to live by the water to look good in these boat shoes. Sperry's top-siders have been around since your great grand-daddy. This model has the rawhide laces which are a step-up from the nylon ones of the lower line (in my opinion). This is a class shoe at a great price.", "Color of leather was much lighter/totally faded than any Sperry Sahara Top Sider we have ever purchased, and my son has been wearing these shoes for years - almost returned them as it is not what we are accustomed to purchasing. They do not look like the traditional shoe. However, instead, my son decided they looked distressed (lol) and opted to keep them. Fit, quality and workmanship very good as usual.", "So far so good! Very happy with this shoe. I bought the wide for my sorta wide feet and they fit perfect.", "First, I have an extremely narrow foot . . . normally I wear a 12 AAA in dress shoes/boots. These are as close to a great fit as I have ever encountered in a casual shoe! The construction is top notch, and the shoe is very comfortable to wear, with or without socks. My only gripe is that the color is somewhat lighter than pictured - in person it looks more khaki than light brown, but I'll take it happily with the fit and comfort being what they are.", "My husband really likes these shoes, they fit well and the price is great .", "I dislike that the price of these keeps going up, while the quality keeps going down, but they're still good enough shoes that I'll keep buying them. The \"half insole\" in mine failed after about 5 months of occasional wear so I have to shoe-goo it back down (shame on you, Sperry), but besides that they're fine!", "Have been wearing Sperrys as my day to day shoe for a long time now (5+ years), but recently the ones I have purchased have only lasted a couple months as my primary shoe... had to return these because the inner lining was peeling after only 2-3 wears. Could feel it like a small rock in my shoe... the ones I purchased before this only lasted 4 months as well.", "I'm very disappointed in the shoe. I never expected a Sperry shoe to have plastic stitching on it. It is too long...probably need a half size smaller but the stitching on the back of the shoe is sticking out and it feels like a piece of plastic stitching. Also the rawhide ties are thin and don't represent the quality I'm used to.", "Sperry topsiders are the best of all the deck shoes I have owned. That having been said, when these came in they were too small. I ordered the same size I've always ordered from Sperry, but when they came in the upper was too narrow, so I had to send them back. Perhaps I'll try another brand this time to see if they are more consistent in their sizing.", "They will stretch and fit fine, but were a little snug compared to my previous pair which were a canvas upper.", "The shoes look very nice and fit well, but I have to give this only 1 star because the right shoe SQUEAKS on every step starting the day we got them. These are brand new shoes, so they certainly should not have that problem. The sound is very annoying and there is no way of fixing it.", "My son wore these (walking around only) for literally three days and the front rubber part of the toe ripped off. I\u2019m so disappointed!!!!", "After a literally years of searching for the original topsiders to replace my old one that died of oild age, I finally found a pair that fit and were exactly the ones that I wanted. Good job!", "Unfortunately, one of the shoes hisses every time I take a step. It sounds like there is an air pocket in one of the heels that won't go away. It is extremely annoying. Other than that, the shoes are good quality, as expected.", "I've been wearing this model for over 30 years. A few years ago it seemed to me the quality of the materials and construction had declined (possibly from moving production offshore), but I think the product has returned to the quality I'd long associated with it.", "Bought these shoes for the spring and summer. They look great. I also like the new laces compared to older models. You can cut the ends of the lace to match the length you are looking for as shoes these days come with shoe laces that are way too long. It's for manufacturing costs, but with these kind of laces, anyone can trim down the lace to their personal length.", "Shoes were typical Sperry quality, Price was 20% less than department stores, Size was available and they arrived in 3 days. Can't complain at all.", "I ordered these for my son and he says they fit great and are very comfortable. Amazon's price was better than in store and with Prime I didn't have to leave my house!!!", "Shoes fit as expected and are about what Id expect in terms of quality. Nothing special though.", "These Top Siders are made in Indonesia and they are smaller than expected. I also had a custom order for Siders through the Sperry website and they were made in the Dominican Republic. Those shoes were a perfect fit right out of the box. I guess Dominicans have wider feet than Indonesians.", "It took me two returns to find the correct fit. However, once I got the correct size the shoes feel great. Both with Socks and without them. Perfect both on the boat and on a casual work day.", "These \u201cnew\u201d shoes came scuffed all over and in a non-Sperry box. Really disappointed as they were a gift for my husband.", "Good fit, similar to past shoes, but quality is way down. E.g., After barely a month of light wear the inner cushion/arch support delaminated and falls out.", "definitely snug in the toe area. after a few extended wears (involving hours of walking...I was at SxSW for context), they're starting to break in and feel better in the toe, but they still feel like maybe a half size small. the material is forgiving so I'm sure they'll feel fine in the future but those first five or six extended wears were rough. For the price though...worth it.", "I like these boat shoes, very comfortable out of the box. I chose the Sahara color, and it is a lighter shade of tan. So far so good, will report back in a few months when I have put some miles on these shoes!", "I had a random defect in the shoes that I received a few months ago, but Zappos and Amazon stood by the product and sent me a new pair despite being after the expired return date. Love the shoes and have been wearing this style for years and finally had to replace them. I still wear the old ones to do work outside though.", "$20 cheaper than the same exact pair in store. Only issue is the right shoe makes a sound like I\u2019m stepping on a little air pocket with every step. Still worth it imo", "My son loves these shoes, this is his third pair. The sole wore out on the last pair and he only had them a year , thought for the most way that they\u2019d last a bit longer but he does wear them a lot", "I was really skeptical on buying this, since the picture shows a matte black shoe, and the ones I saw in a local store were a regular black leather (the ones I wanted). I bought them anyways, and they are the same ones I saw in store. NOT MATTE. Which is great for me. I love them. I will update soon if the quality is not up to par.", "Smaller than the previous pair of the exact same shoes I purchased about ten years ago (and still own/wear). Maybe inconsistent manufacturing standards from one factory to another? Either way, they are comfortable!", "These are the real McCoy at a bargain price...awesome. The local stores had these with really crummy laces, ntlon or cotton or some sort of el-cheapo laces, no thanks! genuine Sperry, leather laces excellent construction. I called Sperry and they said they actually make the cheap versions for some big box stores, so the are actual Sperries...but, I certainly don't want them. Get These!", "I\u2019ve been wearing Top-Siders for more than 20 years. They wear like iron, fit as expected, and are worth every penny. One caution: the arch supports are pretty basic, and the first thing I do with a new pair is install a new pair of Power Steps supports. The combination makes my feet smile!", "Got the A/O Sperry for lot less than what I would've paid elsewhere. Love the color combo.", "I have only had these for a few days but they are everything that I expected. Comfortable with or without socks. Fit is true. Now in the process of breaking them in.", "I've had several pairs of these and they are really comfortable.", "hi either my feet are getting bigger or it was smaller than my normal size ... good value, just wished it fit ... wadewats@gmail.com", "Though I have to agree with others that I would have prefered a full length lining in the shoes, I am completely happy with the shoes. They arrived in very nice presentation shoe box packaging was a step above others I have bought. The shoes had perfect fit, quality stitching and materials appear to be top notch. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.", "I live the life of a frat bro, with that being said, the lifestyle that these Sperry Top-Siders provide are perfect for what I'm looking to accomplish. For whatever terrain, whether on my way late to class, on the intramural fields, or tailgating for game day the only shoes I need on my feet are sperrys. Not only that the comfort and simplicity are completely amazing. After breaking the shoes in they're one with my feet, no socks required. 10/10 would recommend.", "This is the second pair I\u2019ve bought where the sole separated from the shoe at the toe sole stitching. DO NOT BUY. Sperry has gone downhill in both quality and customer satisfaction but not price.", "Bought these for my husband to replace the worn out pair he has. The fit is smaller and the toe box is narrower than his previous pair. Hoping they stretch out with some wear", "Decent product - color looks different than what\u2019s shown on amazon - go a shade darker", "I bought these shoes a very long time ago and am still wearing them. However, the soles of these shoes do not provide very good arch support after awhile. In the beginning, when these shoes were new I could wear them all day, but not I can only wear them for about two hours before my feet start hurting. I have put these shoes through hell though and they still look very good. Pros: Good quality Fits very well Easy to just slip on Cons: No arch support Inside gets really dirty", "Really sharp shoes, comfortable and a great value for the money.", "Sperry is the best brand of boat shoes and these are one of the best styles because its all finished leather and they will hold up to the elements around your feet much better than the suede or microfiber tops on some of Sperry's models. Highly recommended.", "I don't think it is possible for a \"deck shoe\" to have any arch support, but they fit well and are of characteristic Sperry quality.", "Love Sperry topsider. Been wearing them for 40 years. The best boat shoes made.", "I wear a size 14 wide and it\u2019s hard to get a shoe that fits. The shoes fit perfectly, love them", "Been wearing this style and brand of shoe for 20 years. They are still great.", "The shoes are very nice but they\u2019re wider than expected. Luckily they still fit me fine so I don\u2019t mind too much.", "The look is good. These are the real classic top-siders. The colour is darker than expected, but this is minor. The real issue is that the wide version is simply not wide. It is so tight it hurts my feet after a few minutes. And, the leather is not soft enough to stretch out. I will reluctantly have to return them.", "Nice looking but wasn\u2019t going to fit as soon as I put on.", "This is the third pair I\u2019ve bought. Top quality and excellent fit", "These fit great right out of the box. My canvas sperrys are a half size smaller and a medium, even though I normally wear a wide. But these A/O sperrys fit in my normal size, 11W. Like any leather shoe, there's a break-in period, especially to minimize blisters, but the leather is softer and more comfortable than most other similar brand shoes, and they are ready to be worn daily with minimal effort on breaking in.", "Looks great and feels very sturdy. I used Prime Wardrobe to try this and the other two pairs of shoes from Frye and the Sperry won handsdown in look.", "Son and father love them! Purchased Oatmeal. Very thick yet soft solid leather. Comfortable and supportive.", "I am happy with this genuine product. It has the look and feel I wanted. I wiped the laces with a leather protector to soften them and make them easier to tie and untie.", "My main complaint with Sperry shoes is that they always try to use glue-down insoles with glue that feels about as strong as a post-it note. In a shoe where one wears socks, this is not a problem, but when barefoot, the insole comes up after about 25 minutes. If they used a full-length separate insole, or a heel-only insole that was more indelibly bonded to the shoe, they would be perfect.", "I wear this shoe about 340 days a year. For 7 years now.. This is the 8th pair of the exact same shoe I have bought. Sounds crazy, but they fit, are comfortable, are just nice enough looking to wear with all kinds of pants.. shorts, jeans, chinos, even some dressier pants. Great comfort. I waterproof them when i buy a new pair and they tend to last and last.", "Feels fake, bottom sole rubber wore out within 2 days Inside sole feels cheap and felt like it bubbled up same day Have an authentic pair and feels completely better and not as worn out and it is 6 months older", "These appear to wear a bit small. I wear a 10.5 but with these shoes I think I should have ordered an 11. And I've never worn an 11 in any other shoe.", "I got these for my husband and they fit him perfectly! They\u2019re great quality and we are very satisfied with the purchase. Fits TTS", "These are just like the ones I bought 30 or more years ago. They are the original \u201cTop-Sider\u201d shoes in every way. I cannot say anything bad about them. I am very satisfied with this purchase!", "The quality of the shoes is very good, they are comfortable to wear on the feet, the size is standard, and the packaging is also very good. Next time you buy, you will choose another color.", "The shoes fit correctly and are well sewn. The shoes are made in the Dominican Republic.", "The shoe fits fine, looks great, and is the fourth paid I have ordered over a 15 year period. Two pairs are in my summer home in the Adirondacks. The others are here in Florida. I wear them painting, cleaning up, going out to dinner, whatever I am doing. They look dressy and work fine doing dirty work", "These were a casual purchase, I used to boat a lot, but now for casual wear. They don't look like they have as much grip factor like the originals 30 years ago.", "Love them! Exactly as store model but half the price. Would buy more. I wear a 9 and bought a 9 and fit is perfect.", "So far I have been very happy with these shoes. I was worried that they would be hard to break in, or that I would not be able to go sock-less right away, but they have worked out really well. They are true to size; the actual color of the shoe matches the picture (Sahara). If you're looking for a descent boat shoe, I would recommend these shoes.", "Still available as a Slim! On Amazon it was listed as 12AA, but I doubt that is the width of the 12S that arrived. I had predicted this and it turned out to be true. I wear a 12A and this shoe works. The wrap around lace allows the shoe to be adjusted some.", "These are full leather so they will stretch, and i promise you that these fit true to size! You will put them on and they will feel tight but you need to break them in and after a few weeks you won't want to take them off. Seriously, I had the return process started but waited a week or so before getting a size up and so glad I didn't.", "Required for school, purchased many over the years as they are worn basically everyday and always just what we ordered!", "These shoes were purchased as a gift or my grandson. The color selected was dark brown and he was very pleased with the color and fit. Would recommend to others", "I purchased these shoes for my husband and he is very pleased. They are of good quality and he says that they fit well and are comfortable. He wears a size 12 EE. These wear marked as a 12 wide. I was concerned that they might not be wide enough but they fit perfectly.", "Another great buy at Amazon! Usually I can find Sperry's less expensive than Amazon, but this time they had the best deal. With a family full of Sperry Topsider lovers, it's about all about the deal. If you're not familiar with Sperry, the only downside to them is the lack of support but my two guys and daughter LOVE THEM!", "Sperry has no idea what a wide shoe is. They also have no understanding of what length sizing is anymore. I will never try nor buy another Sperry Top-Sider again.", "Fits well, looks great. Like the look with the rivets...", "Sperry shoes are always dependable. I\u2019ve worn them for years and just reordered again", "I ordered 10.5 returned to small Ordered 11.0 to large hmmmmmm oh well", "Not the Sperry's from the past. Bought two pairs, the lining inside have fallen apart after one month. Stay away from these, waste of money.", "Last reviewer was right on. These are not the Sperrys we liked. They\u2019re cheap lightweight. More like slippers", "Satisfied with shoe. Color was as shown and size was good.", "These were a perfect fit for my husband who has wide feet.", "These shoes are in a box in the closet,they are marked 9 1/2 eee the size I have worn for 40 + yrs . I can't even get my foot in the shoe. After I purchased I noticed several comments about incorrect sizing.", "The leather bleeds onto my fiance\u0301's socks. Turns them a nice rust color. I am looking at ways of waterproofing them and I am sure if my fiance\u0301 did not wear socks with them (he has to wear socks when he works in them) they would turn his feet a nice rust color too. I will update again if I come up with a good way to waterproof them.", "My grandson likes these shoes, very durable & comfortable when wearing casual or tough jobs.", "I've been wearing these since 2010. ALMOST EVERYDAY. A couple of days ago some kind of slippery oil got on the soles and I began to think it was time for another pair, but the fact is there's nothing wrong with the pair I got. So I'm going to sanitize these babies and take a little sandpaper to the soles. 'Nuff said!", "It\u2019s a great pair of boat shoes- not really more to add if you know what boat shoes are all about.", "What\u2019s to say. Very nice boat shoes. You can wear for almost every occaison", "Great boatshoes, but not quite the quality when they were made in the USA. Fit was perfect, without socks, might be a tad small with.", "Everything about this purchase was spot on, I was just hoping that it was going to be the Nubuck that my last pair was and it wasn't but that's ok, because these are Sperry's and the quality and comfort was top notch which I have come to expect from their products. Overall, there's nothing I would change and everything went smooth with this purchase.", "Great shoes and very comfortable. I would recommend wearing them with a pair of no-show socks if you plan to walk for a long time. I ordered a few pairs of these.", "Fit is as expected, but the colors are off. Ordered a brown, and the color received was EXTREMELY light. Some leather conditioning oil helped a bit, but not much.", "This is the third pair of this Sperrys Boat Shoe, same size same color, that I have bought over the past few years. Great for use when travelling. Comfortable as well as realtively light weight. The sole needs cleaning from time to time but this is not a major problem.", "Great shoe for summer gatherings and other such occasions. Color is a slightly lighter variation of mahogany, very nice looking with a slight shine. Obviously not the kind of shoe to wear for long distance walking.", "I was a bit skeptical about purchasing these at first with the bright green sole & laces. But my teen son wears them all the time!! I will have to admit they do look \"cool\" and no one else in his school or at church has them. They're even nice enough to wear all dressed up - our school sports teams have to wear shirts & ties on game day.", "These are the typical 80's Top-Siders. The first ones we ordered were too tight and the next ones were a tad wide, but my husband loves them! They last a couple of years, but they do get pretty worn-looking after the first year. He only wears them on weekends.", "Both my son and son in law wear 10 1/2. They both own numerous Sperrys. This pair for some reason was tight on the top arch of both their feet. Had to return.", "Buy the 2EE (wide) Sperry's if you like wearing socks with Sperry's and you aren't about that feet-sweat-in-nice-boat-shoes life. Also my feet are slightly wider than most so the wider ones fit well. Also I sized down 0.5 and it's a perfect fit (2 finger-widths of space in the toe of the shoe). Good, quality pair of shoes, would recommend you buy the conditioner to keep these babies VNDS.", "They said extra wide so I took a chance but that must translate into a E or EE at best. I returned the shoes and was given a refund. I guess Sperry does not believe folks with a wide foot should wear their shoes. Too bad really because I really like how they look.", "What more can you say about these classics? They are a tad narrower than other shoes, but I typically wear a size 13, and that is exactly the size I am with these Sperrys. They look great, and are comfortable enough to wear all day. In fact, I tend to wear these shoes so much that I wear them out and need to replace them every summer or two.", "This is my 3rd pair of Sperry boat shoes over the years and I have always been extremely pleased with them.", "I've been wearing this shoes for a month and they are still squeaky. Expected for a while to break in both after a month? Give me a break.", "Hope my feet last in the time it takes to brake in these shoes!", "This is my second pair of Sperry Top-Siders. I love the shoes: they are comfortable, the sole doesn't wear down as much as my other shoes (so I can wear them for a year), they don't stink (unlike my other shoes...), and they are a perfect balance of dressy and casual: you can wear them out/to work with jeans, or just walking around in shorts. Great shoes, good value.", "My favorite shoe to wear around the office. Goes with everything and helps dress up any outfit.", "My husband has a strange foot size & he swears by Sperry for comfort & look. He is an avid speedboat fan & loves Lake Champlain in Vermont.", "Really nice shoes, I had to go up to a 14 m because the 13m was way too tight. No biggie Amazon returns was easy. I got these for a beach wedding this weekend. They look great with some Kakis", "This item was perfect and was exactly what i was expecting. The item came in no time and was very well packaged and in a great shape. I'm very happy and pleased with the item i received and want to thank the seller for a terrific product.", "I've owned Top-Siders before, back when I was young and still racing large sailboats. Now I'm much older, (71), still very active, but with feet that ache after prolonged standing. NOT So with my new Sperry Top-Siders! I recently wore a fresh out of the box new pair to an evening wedding that called for casual attire. I stood for the better part of four hours during the evening without a single complaint from my feet, an accomplishment that even my super comfy athletic shoes could not replicate. In addition, the shoes looked absolutely great with slacks and Hawaiian shirt. Total comfort for a California night!!", "Amazon is reliable on offering a wide variety of Sperry shoes at a good price, and the free delivery is great. The Sperry shoes have a good weight and are well made. So glad Sperry offers a men's size 16 medium. for my husband!", "The shoe has great eye appeal. The colors are great and stitching looks very uniform. I rated this a four star because the tongue on left shoe is about a quarter inch shorter than the right shoe. It still protects the foot but can be seen upon close examination. It is a sign that these shoes might have some manufacturing quality issues.", "I guess I have to break them in. They're more of a summer/shorts shoe so I will need to wait a few more months to really break them out. These were a replacement of the same pair I bought in 2014 that my dog ate recently.", "The packaging was excellent. I have to wait until all the salt and slush are washed away before I wear them.", "Excellent order. 100% original quality Super fast shipping... Thank you!", "For the past fifteen years I have purchased a pair of these shoes every year and worn them almost year-round. These shoes lasted less than three months! The sole in the front of the shoe came apart along the stitch. The stitching pulled through the sole. I will not be buying these again! Would like to hear from the seller.", "Shoe was exactly what I expected with excellent fit and color.", "I was sailor for many years and these are great boat shoes. They are also a great every-day casual shoe. My old ones, now about 20 years old, are showing their age (as I am) but they are still fully functional (as I am not).", "Vacation shoes - great with either socks or no socks.", "Purchased a pair of Sperry Top-Sider shoes twice through Amazon (9/17/2018 & 12/18/2019) and both pairs experienced a defect where the front part of the shoe's sole pulls apart and stitching comes undone after just a few weeks of normal use! I've worn Sperry shoes for years and have grown to love the brand but these recent shoe orders are clearly lacking in the quality that they once had!", "Great new fabric. Very comfortable and they can be washed which is a huge plus", "The color navy blue is almost black. It\u2019s a bit darker blue than expected.", "A very nice looking and comfortable boat shoe. I love them and even though I do not boat anymore, i'd still buy more.", "Sperry's are incredibly comfortable shoes. A great addition to your wardrobe if you're looking for a sock-less option for the summer, but want something classier than flip-flops. High quality leather and laces. Could use a bit more arch support for longer days, but you can always find a nice insole if that's an issue!", "The shoes are comfortable and seem durable. Workmanship is good. The fit is just right. I have a hard time finding my size in retail stores (13 Wide)..... Glad to be able to order them direct with the assurance that they can be returned if they don't fit as expected.", "You have to have a sperrys in your shoe collection, great shoes comfortable and strong, fits perfectly also but if you have wide feet you may want to order a size or two larger than your original size", "Classic. Love the look of these and they will last forever. The heel soles came loose within a month but i can go without them or can replace them soon. I conditioned them in water and let them dry a few times and they feel great. I wear these with basically any outfit and look great and feel great.", "For my son, he loves them. Fit nice and look nice with everything.", "My husband loves these, he wears them all the time. They're comfy and have lasted several months of weekly wear.", "These were great for about 3 years, then the soles started to get brittle and now (5 years after purchase), both soles have large cracks and my feet get wet almost immediately when walking on wet sidewalks.", "Bought my first pair, expecting quality over less expensive brands I have shopped and I can say that I definitely was not disappointed. The quality, fit, and style of the Sperry Top-Sider A/O is worth every penny. I expected a break-in period, but they were comfortable from the first day I wore them. Tracked over 12,000 steps according to my Fitbit and foot comfort was still good and the leather did not bleed onto my bare feet. I would recommend these to anyone with an active lifestyle who likes to look stylish. If you have been wanting a pair, don't put it off for another day.", "I've worn Sperry's for years and know what to expect. This was a replacement pair, in the same color for a pair I've been wearing for several years. 11/2018 update. I've been wearing this pair for over a year. They are well worn and broken in. I have not had any structural issues as some have reported. It is possible those were one offs and not indicative of the shoe in general.", "Classic Top Sider . . . I have been wearing these shoes for the past 40 years and will continue to do so. It's a spring/summer standard with shorts and chinos.", "This pair looks great but mine was width M and somewhat large.

Not satisfied by the customer service i was provided.", "first time being this kind of shoes and I absolutely loved it!!!! they are super cute and comfortable :D", "it fits perfect, I wear these barefoot and there is a sharp seam on the inside of the right shoe that irritates my foot. I put some electric tape over it and its since then been fine.", "These are the best boat shoes on the market! Sperry is a fantastic brand when looking for boat shoes, and this is the go-to model and color for men. The price here is retail, so it's just about as high as you're going to find it. Nevertheless, it's quite hard to find them on sale. With prime, these shoes are definitely worth the buy. Buy a full size smaller for the best fit though. Pros: color, comfort, brand name, leather quality Cons: retail price", "I\u2019ve worn these shoes for 40 years. They run about a half size small.", "My husband wears a 13 narrow and these fit perfectly.", "These Top-Siders last a long time but they are a bit pricey. I am replacing ones that I have worn for over 2 years. The soles last but you will probably have to put comfort inserts in them to keep them from being too hard on your feet.", "I like the material and look of it. They are juuuust a bit smaller than my usual 9.5 shoes, but that's usually something that your foot will take care of... They seem very well constructed! Do keep in mind a better insole might w Help with long days", "My husband has very wide feet and has a hard time finding shoes that fit. As soon as he put them on he loved them. Told me to only buy him this brand of boat shoe again.", "I love these shoes! They are very comfortable and fit great! They look great and can be casual or dressy! Good for the price! Exactly what i was looking for! I would buy these again!!!!! The quality is good too! I would recommend them!", "These are obviously Chinese knock-offs and not genuine Sperry - they are cheaply made, poorly constructed, and improperly sized - after arguing with the seller about returning them I threw them in the garbage where they belonged - DO NOT be foolish enough to waste your money on these!", "Great Deal! I love this shoe and when I get it at an outstanding price, I\u2019ll sing your praises. Received on time, no issues.", "Great shoes. My husband loves them. They are very comfortable and very well-made. He has had boat shoes made by other companies before that haven't lasted very long. This is his second pair of Sperry Top-Siders and he'll stick with them from now on.", "School shoes for my son. This is my second year buying this brand. My son is very hard on shoes. I will say, Sperry are the only boat shoes for school that we found to hold up.", "They fit as expected and the shipping was faster than expected. They hurt the top of my foot initially, but loosening the laces fixed the problem. They are nice shoes, and the price was fair enough.", "Tried these in a store, and discovered we have to order a full size smaller than we normally do. Of course, always be careful about doing something like that.", "Picked up another pair; my original pair lasted four years of beaches, boats and they were finally destroyed after white water rafting. My only complaint is that they can hold in sweat and will start to smell, but a pair of odor eaters will quickly solve this", "There was a large staple inside the front of the shoe. It was really difficult to get out because of its location. I would have immediately reurned them but my son insisted he needed them now. After 30 minutes of effort we were finally able to remove it. Strange that the staple was between the sole and inside bottom of the shoe. Very disappointed.", "Always have worn this size and never had this problem before and i have not gained any weight. So not sure what is going on so i used a stretcher to widen them across the top of the foot and will try them again tomorrow.", "The sole of this show tore up with in less than a month of my son receiving them. Very disappointed as we have bought this brand of shoe for the biys for years and years.", "I have found these Sperry boat shoes to look great and to be extremely comfortable. I have had many compliments on them. In fact I bought these after seeing them on someone else who bought them on Amazon. I highly recommend them.", "I'm a huge fan of Sperry's and this shoe is no different. I wanted a darker one for dressier clothes and needed to order it online for my unusual shoe size (14.5). It came in right on time in a prefectly conditioned box. I was a little worried it would be darker than I actually wanted the picture did it great justice. Only unfortunate part is one of the lace grommets on the side popped out. But its an easy fix for anyone who's ever owned a pair of Sperry's.", "This shoe is not that well manufactured for what it cost. One shoe squishes when the heel hits the ground. The sole is not well connected to the rest of the shoe. The tongues in both are so floppy and loose that you have to insert a finger or a shoe horn when putting them on. Sperry has slipped.", "good Sperry product. Leather shows scuffs easily as an FYI", "i like the looks and the way that fit. this is a nice shoe for casual wear.", "Very comfortable. I could not tell from the picture that I would have to tie them on top. I had a pair before and they were always coming untied. I guess I will superglue the strings on this pair.", "Size was off. Don't know why because I have ware this brand shoe forever. Makes me think they may be counterfeit.", "I once ordered these through Penney's. What a mistake. When they arrived, they were the wrong style, color, width, and length. They were shoes, and that was the only thing that was right. I had to go to a Penney's to exchange them, not through the mail. This time around I used Amazon. I ordered them on Saturday evening and received them Monday afternoon. They fit well and are comfortable. Definitely will buy these again.", "I have worn these shoes for over 40 years and will never be without a pair. They stand up to a beating and are extremely comfortable. The quality is consistent and the fit is always the same. These shoes are like old friends I know I will always be comfortable with them.", "I may have ordered a size too small for these, but they still fit me. They're a little snug, but I read that the leather in Sperry shoes expands and conforms to your foot. Since I usually use these for the created purpose, they sounded like a no-brainer. They look nice, wear good, and grip great on deck. I'd recommend them.", "Shoes are good quality and fit well. Since they are leather, one shoe had a mark on it, but that's how it can be with real leather anyway.", "My son absolutely loves these shoes! He wears them almost every day - even to go kayaking! They still look great and he'll probably where them until they fall apart. That's what he did with the last pair. If worn only casually, these shoes will last a lifetime!", "The 2nd time my husband wore these shoes the sole inserts came out. He purchases at least 2 pairs of Sperrys a year and has never had this issue.", "This was my first pair of Sperrys coming over from my sebagos of 5 years of heavy useage, and on the 3rd wear the front of the door broke along the line it was sewn, leaving the front portion flopping around. Very disappointed.", "Great looking Sperry, leather a bit shinier than traditional look. The sole seemed to get pretty 'slick' over time", "I was replacing one similar and it was a perfect replacement.", "I loved these shoes. Buttttt my husband has Alzheimer's and can not change from his tan color. But the Blue with blue jeans looks very nice and classy. Sorry I had to return them.", "Just a great shoe for the price. Shipped quickly. Nice color, very close to picture. I was a little worried because someone else commented color was way off. I was also worried about the fit and thought about ordering next half size up but decided to just order my size. The fit is perfect.", "I have had a pair of Top-Siders for a long time. Looked for them localy but took a shot at ordering them and they are justwhat I expected.", "My teenager loves these and got these to replace the exact same color he'd grown out of. We had to exchange these for a half size smaller, but they are perfect for both church and school. Very versatile shoes!", "I can only assume these were real but they didn't look/fit like my past pairs.", "Thet are Sperry topsiders. What else can be said. They fit as expected and last almost forever.", "Nice casual shoe. How can you go wrong with a boat shoe with shorts? My husband wears them all the time", "way way way too small. Also not nearly what I expected for the cost of the shoe. I sent them back.", "Poor Quality Sperrys. Over the years I\u2019ve bought multiple sperrys that have lasted me from half a year to two years. I have seriously never had such a bad shoe but these were falling apart one month in. The base was peeling off from the front and the whole shoe was falling apart. I have already retired them and bought a new pair.", "A comfortable and nice looking shoe... however the color was a tad more drab than that of the color in the photo.", "They look really nice, no scuffs, scratches or nada. smelt beautiful and are really lightweight. I have to say its definitely one of those shoes you have to work into. Narrow and somewhat tight. Have a feeling i should of got the Extra width optioned one. But they are really nice shoes and go good with all my clothing, almost immediately people are intrigued by them when walking in a room :)", "I bought these to replace a pair of Sperry's that I had purchased about 5 years. The original Sperry's were great...very comfortable and had good support. While these Sperry's fit well, there is absolutely no support.", "These shoes look very nice and seem to be well made for a casual shoe. However, I found them quite tight for a size 10. I can wear them with a thin pair of socks and the lacing fully open. I hope they will loosen some with wear.", "Perfect sperry shoes. As expected but cheaper than box stores", "The shoes let out a squeak every time I step. Probably the most frustrating shoes I\u2019ve ever bought. I returned them and got the same pair from the same seller & the first pair was clearly fake. The stitching all around the shoes was off, the sole looked awful, the inner lining was nothing compared to the real pair they sent me after I complained.", "Love my Sperry Topsiders...quality shoes. I have purchased this same pair 3 years running. Typically the first part to go is the inside leather insert. I would note that the soft leather is almost suede like. It will show scratches and wear but I think it looks great no matter.", "I am very picky when it comes to my shoes. I require both comfort and look when I consider shoes and will not sacrifice either. This shoe is easily the most comfortable boat shoe out there. I have tried on others and there is no comparison. Sperry's leather just feels softer to me. As for the look, the shoe I got was exactly as the picture shows it, so if you like that then you're golden.", "Had a little squeak to them when you walked. Seems to have gone away after some use", "Have been wearing this style and color of shoe for over 10 years. They never seem to wear out, but the light color does get scruffy over time which requires a new pair after 2 or 3 years. Do wish the arch support was a little more accentuated, but they are great shoes otherwise.", "My daughter wears these as school shoes, and we have been though 3 pairs since Sept. the soles literally tear apart. They don\u2019t even do PE in them, so it is just walking the halls. Very disappointing from a top named brand.", "They are classic Sperrys with great traction on a boat deck. I wear them year-round, even in snow, because I feel like it's still summer and I'm on a boat!", "I bought the *exact* same shoe almost two years ago. They were fine. I wanted to replace them with a new pair, so I ordered the *exact* same size, color, etc. The printed size underneath the tongue was identical on both the old and new pair. Yet, the new pair were clearly much narrower. It wasn't even close. I should have taken a pic - the difference was obvious. They don't even offer a wider version. These were supposed to be 9.5 - 2E or W. They were clearly more like a \"D\" width.", "The last time I purchased these , two years ago, they were $90 . I need a wide shoe so everything worked. All good \ud83d\ude0a.", "My go to shoe for summer outfits. Goes with pretty much anything. Just a heads up, the actual shoes are significantly lighter than pictured. Like the color \"Sahara\" implies, it's much more of a sandy color then the medium brown picture implies. Update 2013/12/11: Looks like they updated the picture to better match the color.", "Arrived on time Box was repackaged, shoes did not appear like a pair, poor cosmetics Left fit well, right was possible from another pair, though marked same size. I felt this pair was not up to any standard other than a manufacturers second!", "loved the shoe but not wide enough. I sent this one back and ordered another pair with a wider width.", "Nice to be back in a pair of sperry's. My last pair lasted me two or three years, and I really abused those things. I'll take better care of these and hopefully get a little more wear out of them. These things are comfy out of the box and SUPER comfy once broken in. Can't really go wrong with these.", "Wore them right out of the box for a vacation trip and walked a lot thru airport and hot southern city. Very comfortable.", "Good price on these and the color is exactly what he wanted, BUT there is no arch support at all. It feels like you are walking flat-footed on hardness. He likes them well enough that we will be buying some kind of insert to increase arch support and cushiness.", "I don\u2019t think they are Original. I\u2019ve been using Sperry for years and next to me Sperrys they don\u2019t look as nice and the quality is not the same. Don\u2019t recommend them but they are ok", "First time boatshoe user. Didn't realize these were essentially slippers that are socially acceptable to wear in public as a grown man. Minimal support, but comfy. Laces tend to come loose, but no big deal. Toe box is a little larger than average.", "Comfort and style, what more could you ask for?! True to the sherry brand. Very attractive shoes. Fit as expected", "Shoes are great I love sperry's! However, the pair I recieved from Amazon squeak really bad when walking. Both shoes. Seems like a defect of some kind cause I've owned other sperry's and they didn't have this issue. It is a loud squeak, people around me when wear I them make comments about it cause of how loud and noticeable it is. Not good!", "I love Top Siders, I've been wearing them for years. I knot each lace above the top eyelet, cut the rest of the laces off, and wear them as slip-ons. They last forever and are the perfect shoes to keep near the door for a run to the store, garage, etc., even without socks :-)", "as soon as I received it I knew that it wouldn't fit me. The shoe it's amazingly beautiful l, nice made and the leather used in its building it's nice and smooth but it didn't fit my size I would suggest an 1 size up. I currently live in Colombia so it's difficult for me to return it and ask for a replacement it would me more expensive than buying a new one. It's a shame. I'm mad for this", "These particular shoes are hard to find. The Authentic Original can be hard to track down unless you want to pay a lot. The price for these are amazing and they are exactly the same as store bought ones. They do not different from the pair you can get from the Sperry website and you can get them cheaper here.", "Very comfortable, and great looking leather (amaretto). My go to for the summer. Order half a size large.", "Authentic, well priced and extremely comfortable. Very happy with this purchase.", "After wearing these once they ripped at the seam. I wore these just around the house and I could almost see into the shoe at my socks. The seller luckily had no problem returning and refunding but I wouldn't buy again.", "I buy new Sperry's every year, they look great and go with anything.", "My son loves these!! Gets a new pair every year because he literally where\u2019s them everywhere!!", "Narrow and long, very hard sole that seems to bulge down the middle after a few months use, cold, very abrasive at ankles and inner stitching.", "The shoes are excellent quality and even more, the service was really spot on. I ordered these as a gift for my son and accidentally ordered a narrow fit. It was so easy to return the shoes and get the correct size ordered! Truly a painless online shopping experience and he's delighted with his new shoes!", "The Classic. This is probably my 20th pair since the 1970's. Great, comfortable, casual shoe", "They are Topsiders. What more can you say. If you have ever had a pair, you will always have some.", "This is my second pair of these exact shoes. The first pair lasted about 6 months before the insole came out of the right shoe. With this new pair, I wore them less than a week and the insole began to separate again. Obviously I returned them and would not recommend purchasing them again.", "Got these for my son's foot. He is a wide width and it helps to know I can get them here at a reasonable cost. I will say he needs to wear them with the Sperry socks to avoid blisters. He is breaking them in as his feet are thicker than most. Otherwise they are nice looking shoes.", "Don't fit and so light weight you wonder what the seemingly fake leather is made of.....really sad. I still have an old pair that I could never quite wear out but I sent these back and did not reorder the next size up as there are now competing brands that care about their name.", "My son had a dark brown pair of these boat shoes that he had just about worn out. I went to several sites looking for replacements but found the shoe he wanted on Amazon at a very good price. They fit very well but take two or three days of wearing to conform to his feet, but after that they are very good.", "Perfect slip on boat shoe that's dressy enough for the office. Pretty much the standard Sperry boat shoe. Comfortable, but could use a little more arch and ball cushioning. Not recommended for long term standing or lots of walking.", "These shoes are so-ooo comfortable. Do you know how the soles of new shoes are always so stiff until you break them in? Well, not with these babies. They almost have the feel of moccosins. They are so light. I intend to get another pair soon. I. .Love. These. Shoes.", "Every young man should grab a pair of these. Very comfortable casual boat shoes, that pairs nicely with 3rd party insoles.", "I have a slightly wider foot. I purchased my size. While the length of the the Sperry boat shoes was fine, the width made my feet feel like they were in a vice. My feet hurt for 1-2 days after wearing these. Quality shoe but horrible fit.", "Color is beautiful! My stepfather got these amaretto topsiders for Christmas and loves the color! The fit is great and since he's been wearing Sperry Topsiders for years there was no guessing when it came to size.", "Same authentic perry top-sider that can be found on the website for a retail price of $88. Great quality leather, good padded sole, and amazing classic look! Fit was perfect for size 11M! I size as a 11.5 in Nikes (they size small) and a size 11M in the rest of my shoes and dress shoes. Perfect fit!", "These are great shoes. I have a very wide foot which a difficult fit. A little tricky I've learned is to fill the shoes with warm water, wait a couple minutes and then wear them. They'll be perfect within an hour.", "I am on fourth pair of these. They are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. I have a wide foot (EEE) and they fit great which is not always the case with the shoe I buy. When the ones I am currently wearing need replacing, I will definitely be buying another pair.", "This will be the last pair of Sperry Topsiders I buy. A double wide should be a double wide and have adequate width. It seems other manufacturers know how to do it! Sperry has lost touch with its product and its consumers.", "They fit perfectly. My wife and I are going on a cruise this month for our anniversary and I needed a pair of boat shoes. Sperry Topsider\u2018s are legendary and I have always wanted a pair", "I've worn Sperry's for years without any problems. I have had this pair for less than a few weeks, and they are already falling apart. Very disappointed in the purchase. Do not buy through Amazon - buy direct through the manufacturer if you want them to last for more than a month.", "These fit somewhat small but we've bought them before - my husband's 9 1/2 feet needs a ten in these. Otherwise, he says they are comfy and he gets a long life out of them.", "I buy a pair of Sperry's every summer. I try to stick to this style and color. They are comfortable and easy to wear without exposing my ugly feet in flip flops. Grown men really shouldn't wear flip flops away from the beach or pool. These are great shoes and they hold up well.", "Much lighter color than the photo indicates. Quality seems more flimsy than the pair I bought from the store.", "I have been wearing these shoes for over 30 years. They are the best casual shoe you can buy. They are durable and with a little and I mean little care they will last decades. I still have a pair over 15 years old, they look a little rough but are as comfortable as they were new.", "Typical quality you\u2019d expect from Sperry. Look great and comfy", "I love these shoes. I've been wearing sperry top siders for years and I love the comfort and fit. I have back problems and need comfortable shoes that are lightweight. No footwear that I've tried us as comfortable for me. I even got my dad and co-workers hooked on these shoes!", "Wore these on a trip to Mexico City and they were awesome. Climbed the stairs of the Pyramid of the Sun in these. Held up great and no sore feet. On the second to last night I tripped and got a slight scuff on one, but it is not majorly noticeable. Found my new causal traveling shoes.", "I love this brand and style, but the pair that arrived were mis-sized. I wear a 9.5M. The pair that arrived were marked as a 9.5 but I could not get my foot inside because the pair was so small.", "Great shoes, However if you wear them with no socks, I would budget for one size less than you would normally be.", "The color is definitely much lighter in person (for the Sahara brown shade) but I actually like it a lot more. The lighter tone makes it more appropriate for summer colors. The shoe fits perfectly, do not order a size up or down, it will be too loose/tight respectively.", "I bought these shoes for my neice a to wear with her school uniform and they have already separated from the soles in less than 2 months. She does do anything in them but walk around school in them. I had some back in the day that carried me thru 3 years of high school and beyond. These shoes are no longer top of the line", "I have been wearing Sperry Top-Siders for most of my adult life. This is the first pair that I purchased in Sahara, and I am glad I did. These are glove soft right from the box, unlike some others I have purchased in the past. I really don't see how they could get much better.", "Good shoes - You know what to expect from Sperrys... The 'Navy Blue' color looks great, but scuffs off pretty easily, and it leaves you with baby-blue patches of wear. I tend to put my shoes in pretty challenging situations, so maybe you could make the color last better than I can.", "The perfect boat shoe for the price. The only issue I had was they scuffed a little bit on a sidewalk and cut the leather but not noticeably. Well-worth the price!", "I am very happy with my shoes except for the fact that my left heel has an opening which makes a squeaky puffing sound every time I take a step. I can't plug or widen the hole since I can't find it. Overall very nice inexpensive casual shoes, stylish and timeless!", "BougHt these to replace ones we left on top of the car while leaving for a football game. When we arrived one was found on the luggage rack and one was somewhere along I-95. My husband was upset that he wouldnt find another pair but we did. Great shoes and he wears them on his feet when we go on road trips.", "These fit just as I hoped. I wear boat socks with them and have walked a ton in them! They are still holding up as like new minus your normal scuffs. They are great for your wardrobe because beige, navy, and light red giving you some options to pair to your outfit. Highly recommend them!", "The stitching has already started to tear apart on one shoe, though I wear the pair only occasionally. They seem to lack the durability of previous Top-Sider shoes.", "Love these shoes, the become nice and smooth as they age.", "Best Shoes !!! I thought I needed the wide ones but didn\u2019t ! Best Sperry!!! Beautiful color as well! Haha sorry my sherry photo are obviously been worn a lot haha!!", "These were a gift from my son and he wears them everyday! He said they\u2019re comfortable.", "I am extremely disappointed in this product. I bought these shoes for my husband as a gift . He wore them about 3x and on the last one the shoes lace broke off completely. The shoe is unwearable now. He also pulled the tongue part of his shoe to adjust it and broke a piece of. Not a happy customer", "These shoes initially left my foot raw. However, after some brief researching, I learned that if you dump these shoes in a solution of sea salt and water, they soften up. Lo and behold, these shoes got a lot soften and broke in a lot quicker. Once these shoes are broken in, these are almost guaranteed to be the most comfortable shoes you own. These shoes look great with a wide variety of clothes, and I recommend this to anyone looking for a classic look.", "I\u2019ve worn Sperry Top-Siders and Boat Sneakers for over 50 years. I wouldn\u2019t go on a boat without wearing them.", "The sperry\u2019s I received were unwearable due to how much they squeaked. I tried breaking them in around the house for two weeks but it didn\u2019t make any difference. Complete waste of money", "Great looking loafer and very comfortable for a very reasonable price. Could not find them for less anywhere else.", "This is my first pair of sperrys and I love them. They're very comfortable and look great. My only issue is they squeak when you walk, kind of sounds like air escaping. I'm hoping it goes away after breaking them in.", "Have had Sperry\u2019s for years and these have ruined my confidence... I have a pair that has lasted for 6 years and these lasted all of 60 days. My confidence is gone! They lasted just long enough to fall outside of the return period!", "The perfect shoe. Been wearing Sperry\u2019s since I was a kid and now my kid is also wearing them. Long lasting comfort that can\u2019t be beat.", "These fit very snugly when you first receive them. Wear them without socks for a while to work them in a little and they fit like a glove!", "Very comfortable right out of the box. Very long lasting shoes if they wear anything like previous owned.", "First time we ordered it had a giant scuff on the front. It was too obvious to ignore so we sent back. The second pair we received was better but STILL had damage on the front. Not bad enough to bother sending back again. Good deal but poor quality. Besides that it seems to be a good shoe.", "Size 14 mens shoe was more like a 12. Very disappointing, returned item and went with a different brand (don't have time to chance not fitting). Quality of shoe was very high, really wanted Sperry vs other brand.", "My grandson is very pleased with his sherry\u2019s ,he loves the color the way they fit and the quality is awesome.I will order another pair soon.Thank for getting my order to me in a timely manner.StaySafe", "The shoe looks and wears great. The right shoe squeaks at the heel. The squeak comes from inside if the shoe under the sole. I do not know a solution for this but it is a little embarrassing in quiet places.", "I love them! Super comfortable, stylish, and durable. Easy to slip on and off. My one complaint is that the left shoe makes a squishing sound when I walk, but it is slowly going away I think. It's annoying, but I can deal with it", "I have been using this shoe since the 70's ...well they are still pretty good but not as hardy as before now they are built in DR ( Dominican Republic) but for the money I payed its a good deal.", "What more can you say - you get what you see. Very nice shoes.", "I purchased these for a friend's birthday & he was so happy with these shoes! The color was great; they fit true to size & he raves about how comfortable they are!!", "These are a Christmas present fvor my husband so he has not worn them yet but I am sure they will fit.

Expected better for a $100 item.", "Have owned multiple pairs as they are always comfy and always fit perfectly.", "Bought these for my boyfriend and they look really nice on him! The price was right too! Just hope they hold up and don\u2019t fall apart quickly. Will be back to update!", "Perfect fit and so comfortable.

Ended up with their higher-end Gold Cup model that is more comfortable and fits as expected.", "These shoes are a Christmas present for one of my grandsons, so I have no comments at this time. I received them within the time frame that was promised, and they arrived in good condition. I like the looks and they seem to be of fine quality. The real test is what a 16 year old grandson thinks! He wanted them to fit his \"style\", and for the comfort and wearability (his Dad has worn Sperry's for many years).", "Not comfortable at all, esp. it is cruel to the heels.", "So glad it comes in a narrow since those are hard to find!!!!", "I have been using this kind of shoes since 15 years ago and in fact my Sperry Topsider that I bought in 2003 is still durable and I know I can still wear it for a long period of time. The only reason I bought a new one is the color faded already. I wear the old one almost everyday, rain or shine but it doesnt change the quality! This new one, I have been wearing it since the day I received and my feet is getting more comfortably with it! Sperry Topsider are the best!!!", "I purchased these for my husband. He has worn these as slippers for many years. This new purchase was received on the scheduled day, and fit as his old ones.", "Something has happened to Sperry.

I no longer have a sailboat, but I still wear the deck shoes. I recommend wearing them without socks.", "worn same pair for years, needed some new ones, so hard to find until I found them on amazon, bought 2 pair really would be great if they had just a little more arch support, but still like the shoes, I soak or wear my shoes in water and thn wear them for a while and the leather will form to your feet, making a more comfortable shoe for wearing all the time with shorts or jeans, thank Sperry, and thanks amazon for carrying the shoe.", "My husband, who is anything but a \"loafer\" type of guy loves these shoes.

After you own them for a while they can get smelly because they are usually worn without a sock.", "These shoes fit just right, were shipped quickly, and look good, as I've come to expect from Sperry.

Based on the display picture I thought is was a slip on with faux laces but it turned out to be a lace-up after all.", "Living up to the Sperry reputation for a quality made shoe. It is a no brainer if looking for a stylish casual shoe.", "I can dress it up or down- love the comfort, quality, and durability", "I have had two pair of what I thought I ordered. These looked the same in the picture but were not like my previous pairs. Much narrower and the sole was not like my others so I had to return them. They may work for others but not me.", "Hard to find nice shoes to fit my husbands size 15 wide foot, they give him plenty of room", "I love them but a little tight for a long day", "Fit well, after a few months, they get that familiar wear. After a year or so you start to see that dirt settling into the leather and they become full time casual shoes.", "Made very cheap believe they are a knock off of the brand ...", "Stunning color combo Black/Cabernet! Can boat shoes be elegant. This pair says \"yes!\" I'm basing my fiance's Autumn wardrobe around these very comfortable, but very stylish shoes. Seller was great getting them shipped fast.", "Comfy and great. Oatmeal color goes with most blue jeans", "Fast delivery but poor quality. Out of the box the shoes had scratches on them. And I ordered a wide width and its still tight. If I ever buy Sperrys again it wont be from this distributor, but rather from the outlet store.", "Even though the picture shows a light brown shoe for the Sahara color, and the box agrees, the shoe looks nothing like it.", "Sperry's Top-Sliders are just simply awesome shoes. They last forever with hard use. I average about 5 years of use until they are finally wore out. I just ordered my third pair. My only complaint is that the soles are a little hard to wear walking around all day. So I just put Dr. Sholes Gel inserts in them and they are good to go. Highly recommended.", "I had a cheaper knock-off that only lasted a few months, but these are the real deal and should last much longer. They fit correctly (size is just right) and look great. From now on I will only buy Sperry and save money in the long run.", "I have owned this shoe for years before they wore out. It is good looking and comfortable. My favorite shoe.", "These shoes squeeked excessively! I thought that it might work itself out so I wore them for a month. The noise got worse-- people around me noticed! These shoes are not the same quality as those of my history with Sperry Topsiders. I just tried to return them, but Amazon will no longer take the return (over 30 days I guess). They look great, but I will no longer wear them. My loss. One star...", "Slightly on small side for the size I ordered. Otherwise, these are perfectly okay shoes. They are plain shoes, and really, nothing more. Or some reason I had expected a little sharper look. But I will use them, and in certain situations they will be perfect. Just not the overall, all-around, go-to shoe that I had hoped for.", "I wear this shoe with no sock at my regular size. Fits perfectly. Snug but not too tight due to the supple nature of the material. It does not feel like it will slip off my foot. The strings are a little hard but they should soften with time. Glad I bought this shoe.", "Shoes are comfortable and look great. The price is pretty good too. Only complaint is that the shoes run a bit big in the front and that laces are a bit short making it a bit weird/messy looking when tying them. Other than that, it was a good buy.", "I have worn Sperry Top Sider's since I was in High School and on Submarines when I was in the Navy.. The soles are perfect for high gloss decks leaving no marks. I continue to wear them and I cant think of another shoe I would wear.", "Fits as expected for a Sperry boat shoe. Toe volume is suitable for wearing no socks. Price is getting expensive for these shoes.", "The picture shows a slip-on style shoe. The ones I received had laces. Ugly laces. I am returning them. Buyer beware.", "good shoe-had them in the past. 14 wide was a whole lot easier to find @ amazon-stores usually don't carry above 13", "I loved these shoes. Unfortunately, they no longer make them and I have not been able to find a replacement that I like as well in my size. Very disappointing.", "These are very nice leather. They were a little narrow so I used a shoe stretcher and now they are fine. May need an insert because the bottom is only half way. Not sure why Sperry decided to go cheap on the footpad. But the shoe is nice for casual dress.", "These are the type shoe, that upon putting them on, you know you could spend the entire day wearing them without thoughts of problems. You could put them on the next day and have the same result.", "I sent these back since they didn't fit, ordered something when Sperry had them on sale.", "Love Top-Siders! I have five pairs. Well made, and very comfortable.", "I received these shoes on Aug. 1, 2018 and the front of the sole split off on Sept. 1, 2018. Of course it is a holiday weekend and you can't call in. Grrrrrr", "I have always liked Sperrys. I foolishly thought cheaper look-a-likes would be adequate. I'm back to a good product at a good price.", "My high school son wanted these for every day shoes (as an alternative to sneakers) and has been very happy with them. Says that they are more comfortable than sneakers, and I think he looks a little more put together in them. Rare that a purchase pleases us both, but this one did.", "I purchased these for my brother for Christmas. I was extremely happy with the price ($15.00 difference in some cases) I don't wear these, but he says they are extremely comfortable (They must be, I've purchased these for him the last two years)", "Love the look and feel of this shoe. It's a classic.", "Great boat shoe. Navy is hard to find and This is very nice!", "While my son loves Sperry top- sider this last pair he got were a big dissapointment to him. When he wears them the shoes make a noise that he says sounds like he is passing gas. He wants to return them but he has thrown away the packaging. He is a senior in high school so you can imagine how distracting this can be in the school setting. Any suggestions as to best handle this? Thank you!", "Bought these for my son and he typically wears a 9.5 I went up to a 10 and they fit him perfectly with room to grow!! I thought this color might be too dark but it actually goes great with his clothes!! He couldn't be happier! I highly recommend for a great casual comfortable look!", "I really like Sperry boat shoe! this one is really comfort! very light weight blue color is also very good! I used my previous for a long time (4 years), I hope this will be also so good!", "I intended to wear them barefoot on a liveaboard scuba diving sailboat. They were a tad too small for true comfort. Since true comfort is what this is all about, go a half size big and you'll be happy as a clam (and who has ever heard one complain?).", "it doesn't fit even though i fit 11 in everything else, i should have bought a 10", "Ordered as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved them. He said they were a bit tight but I believe that\u2019s because the shoes are brand new and need to be broken in. Otherwise a great shoe and very satisfied with my purchase", "My son has worn these for a month and the sole is letting go and both shoes for the money you pay this is unacceptable \u2193 doubt if i can return just pass the one month mark", "I was looking for a quality shoe that I could just slip my feet in without sox and was comfortable. Fantastic. The leather is as soft as the kid leather in my car. Definitely more satisfied than some shoes I have purchased that cost much more. I would recommend these shoes to my best friend.", "Great savings for the same item at the dept store for more.", "When these shoes were delivered they were perfect. The fit was great the color was exactly as shown in the picture and they arrived so quickly. Saved me a trip to the local mall to find that they didn\u2019t have may sons size (12 men\u2019s and still growing) or the color he wanted. Great shoes and great experience. Really like the picture notification I got on my phone. Amazing", "Love sperrys. The break in is a little tough and may cause some blisters on your heels, but feels great when the leather softens up and last forever. Had them for over 2.5 years and still look great!", "I've worn Top-Siders since I was a kid. They wear well and are as comfortable as a slipper. Which I'm sure they will be used for when I break them in. Top-Siders are a well made shoe and I have never had a pair that disappointed me.", "I\u2019m experiencing some swelling in my legs and feet. At present, I can\u2019t fit into the shoes. They are a half-size larger than my old ones, and I hope eventually I will be able to wear them, but that will have to wait.", "first things first, the Sperry shoe has lost some of its luster over the years. The seam where the leather meets on the top of the toe box splits in some places. The shoe itself arrived a bit scuffed, which concerned me at first, but I realized that that really didn't matter, as I would probably scuff it myself later, but one part of the shoe was bruised. All of this knocked off a star. The other comes from the fact that the shoe did arrive a day later than what the estimated shipping time said. Shipping was a problem. It took more than a week to arrive.", "Love the fit and comfort. Not sure how the soft, supple leather will wear.", "THIN leather, not as sturdy as they were, soles thinner, quality iffy.", "I bought these for my husband for Father's Day, and he loves them. However, his feet were orangish brown after one particularly hot and sweaty afternoon wearing these. The dye stained both his socks and feet!", "Taught they were true to size, need to return and grab half a size lower", "Yes, exactly as ordered, however the leather is a little stiff for my liking. But shoes are great and fit perfectly.", "Nice shoes and very comfortable out of the box. Tongue seems a small tad short. Otherwise, no issues.", "This was a gift for my son-in-law and they were exactly what he wanted and a perfect fit.", "Great quality. Bought them for my boyfriend to wear to a wedding that was Tommy Bahama style. They were perfect very comfortable and look great. I would highly recommend this product.", "They're okay- wish I had gotten a darker pair of shoes, but these serve the purpose. Would recommend. Fits as expected- Size 9D", "Purchased for my husband's birthday. They fit well and the color is great. Only con -- could use a little more padding inside so he bought an insert.", "Comfortable, 12 he daily wear. Every summer I buy a new pair of I need or not... dress or casual they work gr8!", "fit as expected for this name brand... they seem in general to run a half size larger then most shoe manufactures. Sperry shoes a a great shoe.", "This is my husband's favorite! He has worn them for at least 30 years and continues to buy the same style. :)", "Beware: Too small! not the color! I have used all my life 9.5. this is not 9.5 is like an 8; the shoe last is very small, besides smells horrible, very horrible like cheap plastic Not expected from Sperry and for $90 I feel cheated. Almost 20 years buying from Amazon, first problem. Dificult or impossible to return goods, foreign customer", "Very nice boat shoe and very comfortable although I had to get a 1/2 size larger than usual since Sperry changed manufacturing from China to Indonesia. Sizing does seem to be a problem with many shoe companies as they shift manufacturing from one country to another.", "I went hiking in Alaska two days after purchasing this. On the first day I realized I had forgotten my hiking boots, and the only shoes I had were these Sperry topsiders. I was incredibly nervous about using them, but they completely exceeded my expectations. While they don't have tread like boots, Sperrys are designed to A) keep from slipping on slick surfaces, and B) keep water out of the shoe. In the first two days of using them, these shoes have earned a place in my favorites. Would recommend to anyone!", "At first a little snug,as they suggested a size smaller than normal due the fact you do not wear socks with them,but they quickly reshaped themselves for a comfortable fit.I will buy them again.", "a little too big but nice shoe, order a size smaller than usual", "Quality way below what it used to be. I bought a pair from Timberland and they are way better quality.", "The arch is a little uncomfortable-it may just be this one pair because I have bought this shoe many times and I\u2019ve never experienced a problem before. One issue, the shoelaces will not stay tied....but I love the shoes.", "Bought extra wide. Nothing wide about it. If you have a wide foot stay away. Don\u2019t waste your time.", "I may have gotten the wrong size. I received a 10 S. Not sure if this means Small or something else. My original order said 10 D. What does the \"D\" mean?", "They squeak when I walk. Doesnt bother me, but it bothers people in my home and office...", "I normally wear an 11.5 and bought 11\u2019s which do fit. They were a tiny bit tight at first but after several wears they fit great and I can slip them on.", "I wore these shoes about every day for several months. However, I've never had a pair of Top-Siders where the insole in the back came unglued. This makes them almost impossible to wear without socks. Also, the laces come undone very easily.", "I bought these shoes for my grandson in college. He loves them, he tells me that's all the Cool College kids wear. When he is Happy, so is Grandma. As a matter of fact, I purchased him his 3rd pair from you in another color.", "Fit was weirder than sperrys I bought in the past I guess I just have to break them in, overall a good shoe; color was a little bit darker than expected but still satisfied.", "Fits like all Sperrys do. A little lighter color than I though but nothing a little saddle soap didn't fix.", "Shoe is a bit darker than color in picture but I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. I wear them daily and have no issues with the shoes falling apart. It's a yes ,worth the purchase from me!!", "Have worn Sperry shoes for many years and never had a complaint. These shoes are no exception.", "I have been buying Topsiders for >40 years - but will stop since the quality continues to decline. My last pair developed a crack in the sole after just 15 months. I am out.", "Gave 5 stars because shoe is well made but not true to size. Very tight. Get larger size if buying", "Nice shoe, but it is cut way too narrow. I ordered double E - when I normally wear a D width. The double E is not any too wide.", "Soo sexy, I always feel like I'm on a boat and the Sperry quality continues to hold strong. Don't listen to the naysayers, if you put your shoes in a blender you can't be miffed if they get blended!", "My son's favorite shoes for the summer. He says they couldn't fit better and once he has scuffed them up a bit, they and his sandals are his everyday go to shoes.", "I have worn Topsiders for years. They are stylish, and besides, I hate wearing socks. They take me a bit of time to loosen up, and after that they are old friends.", "the last pair of Sperry Top-Siders I had lasted for 7 years as my go-to shoe. They are incredible durable and comfortable and pretty versatile why it comes to styling. Can't go wrong here. They should be a part of anyone's summer wardrobe.", "These shoes look great and last a long time. I love how versatile they are. I can wear them in the office and on the beach and not look out of place. Once they break in, after a couple of days, they are very comfortable.", "I\u2019ve always loved speedy as a boater/ ship enthusiast and these are my favorite among them. Dress me up or casual them down lol", "Seem to be well made and durable but a bit narrow in the toes. Therefore a bit tight and not comfortable all day. Maybe they'll stretch over time. These do not have arch support but that is not at all expected in a boat shoe. Arrived early and well packed but narrow in toes.", "I love these Sperry Top Siders. This color leather was rather hard to find but the seller shioped them quickly and in good condition. Depending what you are using them for, I usually don't wear socks with them and also as you break them in the leather stretches.", "Just as expected, another fine shoe by Sperry. Would buy again.", "Mostly wear to work, but are great for casual weekends as well. Size was true to fit.", "Did not fit as advertised, despite saying it was true to fit. peltz shoes charged a restocking fee, so their misinformation came out of my pocket", "I've got my husband hooked on sperrys!! I've worn the women's for years and had ever tried them. Being a size 16 they are carried few places locally so I purchased them as a gift and these are his third pair", "Oh boy, I might get another pair. Wear em without socks, it is that comfortable.", "They're Topsiders -- supposed to be a little loose and worn barefoot.I ordered 8 1/2 EE and have been wearing them all summer. If you want arch support, get off the deck and up in the rigging.", "Very nice product. In keeping with Sperry's great reputation. Nice fit.", "Love these black pair, they are confortable and good looking shoes", "My son wears a 13 wide in Sperry and 12 wide in Sebago. He is very pleased with these shoes. The tan is his favorite color.", "Great shoe for all occasions. Comfortable, lightweight and slip resistant sole make it an ideal casual footwear mainstay.", "What I received is not what I expected, esp. for Sperry! These are a very cheap made model, so glad I didn't buy ones that cost more and be the same cheaply made!", "These shoes are incredibly comfortable and high quality. They are very soft and perfect for business casual at my office. I've let coworkers try them on and they love them compared to stiff Cole Haans. I would highly recommend this shoe if you are on the fence.", "If you normally wear regular width on Sperry's and other shoes you will probably need a wider size.", "Love the shoes, always wanted a pair when I was young but my mother could not afford them. A lot of my friends had them, know that I\u2019m a grown-up had to buy a pair of them. Just want to say thanks.......", "they didn't seem to be of the same quality as the pair I bought at the store and they were a bit loose for new shoes", "Sperry Top Sider - perfect casual shoe. Comfortable and look great!", "I bought the wide because my husband has a wide foot, and the wide was still tight on his foot. Good quality. And after some time the tightness did stretch out", "All I wear to work are Sperry Top-Siders. I've been wearing them for decades. My office is business casual and I find these shoes not only nice enough for office casual wear, they are comfortable, too.", "These Sperry shoes are perfect. They are a little heavy compared to some of my other shoes, but that's probably because they are well-made.", "The leather strap on the top portion is tied in a bow rather than crossed on the top.", "Good looking well made shoe, unfortunately, it was too small and a larger shoe wasn't an option.", "I ordered the \"Sahara\" color for my husband, and they are MUCH lighter than pictured. He ended up liking them anyway so we chose to keep them, but know that they are about 2 shades lighter than the picture and don't have the shinier leather look.", "I've never bought shoes on-line before, but since I knew my size, and I'd had a pair of Sperry Top-Siders which I'd purchased locally in the past, I felt quite comfortable ordering these. They fit perfectly and quite quite comfortable.", "Yup, fit as expected and is still in good shape half a year later.", "While I do like these a lot, the soles are quite thin and do not provide much cushion at all- walking in the city for a while hurts your feet a bit. They definitely are not sneakers but they look great and are exactly what i need for something casual but a step above sneakers", "Authentic and great price!!!!! These 'boat' shoes last for years.", "I have worn three or four pairs of these in my life. The original looks good and ages well.", "Great Sperrys with a great color. These fit true to size, therefore see what is the most common size you use form your shoes and order that size for these.", "Had these shoes for one month and wore them 5 or 6 times and the sole already completely separated from the upper part in front. I should be able to return this worthless purchase but don't seem to have that option here. DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES.", "I had another pair of sperrys in the same size, but these were too big. There is no arch support. I should have returned them.", "My son has always wore an average width shoe, but these were extremely tight. The show it's self is a nice, well made shoe, but we're going to have to return them.", "Good old Top-Siders. Very comfortable. Oddly, though they are \"boat shoes,\" they don't handle water particularly well, but otherwise they're great.", "I thought I'd made a huge mistake when I tried to put these shoes on. They were very tight, and I was not happy about the hassle it would be to take the back. I decided to wear them awhile, and the leather stretched and they're now very comfortable. I ordered my usual size -- and in the end, it was fine, Love the shoes.", "Wonderful support for feet, feel like sneakers not boat shoes. High quality leather and overall shoe. My husband loves them and wears them more than any other shoe.", "These aren't quite what I remember wearing in college, but they're not bad. The inner lining/footbed just doesn't seem as robust as models from the 80s. They're a little snug to start, but should break in well.", "I ordered \"Sahara\" and the picture that is used for Sahara is actually Nutmeg, they've used the same photo twice. Sahara is in much more pink in person", "Love these shoes! Fit is perfect. Shipping super fast. Price was good. Worn Sperry's forever.", "Barely over a month and the toe is separating at the sole. Poor poor quality", "These shoes started falling apart quickly. Normal use. Sole came apart from shoe. Laces broke. Poor quality. I question authenticity. Stay away!", "The Ice color shown is white. Yet, the pair I received is beige or almond color, in an Ice shoe box. I'll keep the pair, but you should change the color in your ads to the darker tone. There is a white Sperry Top-Sider; I'm wearing a pair now, but the shoes are getting old. I'll look for a white pair in a local shoe store. Charles Magill", "This is a nice shoe! I have had a pair like these for over 15 years Same color and size but they where getting pretty bad and my wife said its about time to get a new pair so I did! Like anything new you have to break them so up to the task!", "I don't know if it was sent this way or was damaged during shipment. One of the shoes is bent or has creases where the strings go, like something heavy was placed on top of the box and the stitching on the side looks like its been re-glued or something. Looking from a distance you wont be able to tell, but since I inspect them I can clearly tell the difference from the right and left shoe. They are the shoes I ordered, but this is something to be aware of.", "Come a little smaller than other Sperry shoes. They are still good looking shoes and made too last.", "Boat shoes. Brown. Do not wear on anything slippery unless you want to fall. Somewhat comfortable but they feel very thin. I guess boat shoes are like this but i have worn other sperrys that feel better and safer. At least they look pretty good and seem well made.", "I have been buying these for years. They are always consistent in size and fit. Very comfortable shoes.", "This is the second pair of these I've purchased - still wearing the first pair (now 10+ years old) as my knock-around-chores shoes. This shoe is worth every penny in comfort, appearance and wear.", "One of the few shoe brand that does justice to perfect looking and not deformed shoes to mans with large size. 100% recommended.", "Brown leather was darker than shown in picture. A very dark brown as opposed the the reddish brown.", "You need to break them in at first so they might be snug in the beginning. Great style and good quality.", "Left shoe case scuffed at top and feel like cheap plastic", "I've purchased these shoes in different colors for the men in my family at least 5 times. Good quality, trendy & fits as expected.", "Classic Sperry boat show. Wear mine everyday rain or shine", "The color is not like the picture. I was expecting a more natural leather look.", "Buyers Beware! This shoe runs small in both width and size. It's also a flat show with almost no arch support so good luck walking around in these for an extended period of time. They look great but only if you're standing still or sitting down.", "Like all new shoes, there is a break in period. And during that break in period the left shoe is rubbing my heal causing a blister. Once they get broken in though these shoes feel great on your feet. Just give them time.", "It's been a while since I got a new Sperry Topsider so not so familiar with the current size fit. I thought the size would be similar to Sebagos. Leather seems to have thinned out, at least by my feel. Great contrast between black and neon green. Eye catching! Nice shoes!", "I buy the same shoes about every 1-2 years. I wear them 4-5 times each week. They do eventually fall apart but I put them through hell. 10/10 will buy again.", "look great . .dog eat the last pair and haven't used these yet", "Good shoes, but I received mine with a defect. There was an irritation in one of the shoes (right side) caused by a defect in the inner lining. My feet hurt and feel itchy whenever I wear them. I'm disappointed considering I paid $78 for them. I would recommend buying them in person or ordering a different brand.", "What can I say? Sperry Top-Siders are simply the best. They have been tried and true for many years. They always fit well, and last a long time, at least in our family. They are the tradition that keeps on giving. We will continue to buy them...", "I have had these shoes for around three years now and I still wear them almost every day in the summer. I can wear them all day without my feet hurting and I really could not be happier.", "I have always loved Sperry Topsiders when we were in boating and they are nonslip and very comfortable. I still like to wear them around the house as they are so comfortable.", "Had a prior pair that I've worn out to the point that I can't do anything in them except work in the garden or the garage. Still very comfortable and are over 4 years old - worn several times a week. The new pair are exactly the same. They feel and look so good, and I can wear them with or without socks. I ordered the same size as my previous pair and they were perfectly matched. I was able to get my new pair at a much lower cost than if I had purchased them at a mall store. Sorry - but I really love ordering common things through Amazon and these shoes were no exception.", "Fits well and very comfortable from the very first day of wearing them", "Sperry makes top quality boat shoes and the price here was very reasonable plus delivery was sooner than promised.", "This is the 4th or 5th pair of Top-Siders that I've owned. I'm still wearing one pair that I've had for nearly 20 years. Great color choices, great fit. They even feel good without socks unlike most other brands with similar styling.", "These aren't quite the quality of my previous Sperry Topsiders, but they're still really excellent shoes. These are a hair tighter and the leather quality isn't quite as soft. However, I believe that if you're looking for boat shoes, you'll have trouble finding better shoes than these.", "The inserts are a little rough compared to my old pair which had memory foam inserts (and were an extra $35). But they still have quality to them. We will see how long they last. Definitely have the expected Sperry's quality to them", "Love Topsiders. Old ones falling apart. This one pinches a bit top of left foot. Hoping it will break in..", "Been wearing these for over 30 years. Bought several pair and will keep buying them.", "I've loved Sperry Top Siders for more than 40 years. They are a true classic.", "Bought as a gift for my son. I knew from his previous shoe that he would need a wide and a half size larger than he usually wears. I also bought the Sperry socks because these look goofy with regular socks.", "These are high quality boat shoes. Like all Sperrys. I love the color for the summer. The laces are a little off in color compared to the sole but still a great shoe. I got tan Sperry laces from a store to make them a little less flashy but put the greens in sometimes.", "I have pretty much only worn boat shoes for the last 25 years. Half the time I buy Sperry and half the time I buy an off brand. When Sperry goes on sale and I get those I am always happier. Just much softer leather and look better.", "Fit as expected. Good quality and seem to last about a year before the sole gets hard and slippery with everyday wear.", "I don't wear Topsiders for support. I wear them for casual comfort, but I wear them everywhere. This is my umpteenth pair, and my old pair are now knockabouts. The new pair are for dress casual.", "I don\u2019t think this size was marked correcting said it was a 12 non-wide fits more like a 13.5 wide. Amazon would not accept my return.", "Not the best Sperry shoe. Took a long tim to break in, causing many painful blisters.", "Got half a size smaller than what I normally wear as I heard it stretches a bit while molding to your foot. Initially tight, but fits like a dream after a few days of breaking them in. I highly recommend getting a slightly wider width if you don't think you have narrow feet as it is narrower than most shoes I've come across. I personally love the narrow profile of Converse Chucks and these are surprisingly similar.", "I love the color and sizing of these shoes. I've owned tons of sperry's and they all meet or exceed expectations. The only issue some folks may run into is the smell after long use. I've started purchasing hidden socks to deal with this and that has worked wonders!", "I liked that it fit as expected and the quality is good", "Half a size down from what you normally wear fits perfectly. Love the color of the Sahara. Color matches the picture in my opinion. Only issue I have is with the way the packaged was delivered. It was left at my door in a large apartment complex while I was still at work.", "I bought in Amazon, exactly the same shoes size 9,5 and they were very small. I bought them again in size 10 and now they extremely big. It\u2019s impossible to get the right size and I have wasted a lot of money.", "Great shoes, fitment width is a tad tight, but the length is great. Love these for casual work summer days", "My son loves his shoes! He normally wears a 10, but a 10 in this shoe was too big. The 9 fits perfectly.", "4th pair of these I wear them for 1 year then use them as my boat and yard shoes . They look great and are very comfortable and really take the wear and still look great ! Nothing like them for comfort and wear !", "Sole detached after three weeks, returned for refund. For shoes that cost nearly $80, I expected much better.", "What can I say about these old standbys. I had a pair back in the day and they were great. Time for some new ones though. No surprises here. They seem to be exactly the same as my old ones and I'm sure they will last just as long.", "Sperrys are the best leather boat shoes out there. The amaretto color gets a nice patina to it once they break in/stretch a little bit. Great value if you can catch them on sale.", "Second pair of Sperry's in a year. My son loves them and wears them everyday. I have to special order, as he wears size 15. Very thankful for Amazon and their excellent vendors and service!", "These are my do everything shoes. Love them.

Seems to be a pain to return them... so i'm basically stuck with a shoe that I didn't order. Thanks guys!", "Seemed like a nice shoe holds up well to being worn. overall great shoe my only complaint was that they seemed a bit big i would recommend buying maybe a size or half a size smaller than normal. But its a formal shoe that is comfortable.", "When I wear these shoes I feel like a true seaman. I soaked the shoes in salt water over night, wore them for a few hours while they were wet and they now fit like a glove! This is the first pair of Sperry's I've soaked in salt water and it takes the edge off of breaking them in.", "Really sharp looking Sperrys. I wear sperrys everyday, so I know there is a break in period, once you break them in theyre amazing, Fit as expected and am very satisfied with the purchase", "This is my second pair of Top-Siders. Love the shoe, wear them constantly. Can't beat the price.", "Love these - this is like my fifth pair! My dog also loves these - the reason I need a fifth pair.", "Great shoes. They conform nicely to foot size and are durable.", "I am very glad I purchased this shoe. The price was well below one would expect to pay at a retail location. The only negative comment would be that the color ion certain lighting auditions appears brown. Sizing is almost true but may run a half size larger. Very nice well made product.", "The shoes are very handsome and quite comfortable. I purchased them to replace a thirty + year old pair of Nike boat shoes.", "Returning. Poor quality. Horrible and now I find out I can\u2019t return only after worn less than 2 weeks (had for only a month).", "The shoe is not so much the problem as my long slim feet. I have worn Sperry and other brands for many years when I am lucky enough To find one that fits. Dexter had the best shoe, for reasons unbeknownst to me they went out of business. They had the best arch support. I always paid $40.00 to $50.00 for the shoes. Hardly anyone make more money now than 10 years ago, But now the price is $95.00. What the hell happened,", "I GOT THESE SHOES THROUGH AMAZON FOR MY GRANDSON WHO WANTED THEM FOR CHRISTMAS. THEY ARE EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED . INFACT HE TOLD ME EXACTLY WHERE TO FIND THEM ONLINE. HE SAYS THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE AND TRUE TO SIZE. HE IS A VERY HAPPY 15 YEAR OLD.", "A nice shoe with a very good fit. I am a 12 in every kind of shoe I wear and these are no different.", "Arrived brand new in the box. The leather is extremely soft and supple. Stretched very slightly with use, which I was expecting. I normally wear an 11.5 and purchased the 11 in this shoe. They are a little snug but still adapting to my foot and I have walked a mile or more in these with no blisters or chafing.", "Shoes had been shipped before. Only one shoe had the cardboard insert. Box and contents did not appear \"factory new.\" Box said 11 W ( as ordered), but the shoes that arrived were 11 M.", "Not a very x wide shoe at all... stay clear if you really need a wider width", "Not as good as I expected them to be, especially for the price. Worn okay with socks, but the whole point was to go sockless in them, so not the greatest purchase.", "Too large in the heel portion of the shoe. Good item, well-made, but had to go back due to fit.", "I really didn't like how these shoes came with \"half-insoles\". They weren't even that great of quality. Pretty disappointed. I ripped out the half-insoles and put in some full insoles that I bought at the store. The shoes were really tight at first but over time I was able to break them in. I do like the look and quality of the leather though. So points to Sperry in that category.", "Great summer shoe! The shoe is fairly comfortable to wear all day and I haven't had any problems. Shoe is pretty sturdy and I've beat them up pretty bad but haven't seen it break down at all.", "Great fit! Better construction than the ones I'm replacing that got worn out through all my years in college.", "I love Sperry Top Siders and have worn them for many years, but cannot buy them locally anymore. These are sized much too small. I ordered size 14m and the shoes that arrived had 14m printed on them. However, these 14m shoes are so small that they are probably more like size 12m. I couldn't even get them on my feet. Now I'm wary of buying Top Siders online again.", "Like most folks \"of a certain age\", I believe that Top-Siders are the gold standard for casual wear. This particular style is available in wide widths (which I need as the years go by!), so they are just what I wanted...and at a good price, too.", "I LIKE THESE SHOES THEY ARE CONMFORTABLE TO WEAR, AND STYLISH ENOUGH WHEN I MEET CLIENTS, YET RUGGED ENOUGH TO WEAR AS I WALK THE VARIUOUS PROPERTIES I MUST FOR MY BUSINESS", "This is my second pair of Sperrys.

I can wear them casually with jeans or dress them up with business casual.", "I haven't had these long so I can't speak on the durability of them but after wearing them once or twice, they are very nice and comfortable. Looking forward to wearing these more often. I'll update in the future.", "Having a wide foot it is not only difficult to find shoes that fit, but it is often difficult to find shoes that look good and fit right.

Arrived as expected fit as expected this is a very servicable shoe.", "I have gone to Amazon for their service and return polices which is a win-win for me.

I would like another pair.", "I have wide feet so I have a hard time finding shoes that fit properly. These are a winner.", "I have very wide feet and always have trouble finding shoes that fit correctly. The 10.5 wide fit perfectly however and it's a beautiful shoe. At first it was a bit snug but I did some reading and found it's because the leather stretches slightly width wise once you wear them a few times to conform with your foot. Sure enough after wearing a few times the shoe now fits like a glove.", "Still the best even though the price keeps going up", "I buy these every year, normally in a store. This pair did not last two months before sole fell off.", "I've worn sperry's for years and this pair is just different. The stitching already started coming apart and the thread is cheaper. The leather though softer is thinner and feels cheaper made. The insole is no longer the full length of the shoe and ends near the ball of the foot. All around cheaper feeling and I do not think will last nearly as long. Doesn't surprise me seeing as they're made in China. I will never buy these again if they are still imported and neither should you.", "The shoe fits fine. However, the marketing pictures are TOTALLY misleading. I thought I was purchasing laces free shoes. No where in the advertising of this shoe do they show the ugly laces.", "I love the shoes. You can tell they are well put together and use decent leather. A bit narrower than I'd like in a shoe (and I got the wide), but it's very comfortable regardless. Feel like it'll get better as they break in, too. Overall I'm a fan.", "I\ufe0f had my son try on the shoes at a local store. Than I ordered them from Amazon. The fit and color was what we expected.", "Bought these for my dad.

The off white \"Ice\" color works with so much more clothing options than just a standard bleach white. Excellent Shoe, Excellent Color.", "My husband wears these almost exclusively,won't wear anything else unless dressed up and then under protest. Finds them so comfortable and no matter what the weather they look great.", "Siders are a wardrobe staple.

Everything I expected out of this brand.", "I have had Sperry topsiders for years. The quality dropped off some years back but has since improved.

If you like boat shoes, you'll love these", "The sole on the inside isnt that great if u have flat feet but i fixed that with a gel insert", "Great fit and comfort, but it squeeks! So much you'd think there was a bird following you around! Too bad the squeek came out just as the shoes started getting scuff marks, if not, I'd return them.", "Bought these for my 6'9\" 18-year-old son, who had been wearing a pair of canvas Nautica boat shoes that he had worn through. The Sperrys are a bit narrow across the forefoot but, being leather, they stretched after a few wearings and son is very happy with the comfort and style.", "This product is amazing and really good for the price.", "Only tried them on for size. I have a difficult foot to fit and this size just wasn't right for me. I ordered wide and that probably added length to the shoe. I like the looks very much.", "I have worn Top-Siders for many, many years, preferring them to most other style shoes. I keep several pair, various colors, on hand. Completely satisfied with the shoe and seller.", "Sperrys are very well made, they fit great and more importantly are extremely comfortable all year round. They're sized perfectly and over the past year they've taken quite the beating and show almost no signs of coming apart.", "These show a crossed lace shoe. Disappointed to open them and find that they have laces. Past that a perfect Sperry", "I ordered a wide shoe, but maybe not wide enough (E instead of EE). However it fits snug but I can live with it. I believe that as I wear them mire often, they will fit better. Otherwise very light and confortable!!!", "Comfortable and well-made. Couldn't find my size anywhere local (brick and mortar).", "My favorite kind of shoe - durable and reliable. Pair with some Gecks sockless liners and you're good to go for the summer.", "The bottom liners are not glued properly. They slide around after wearing them awhile. They can bunch up and cause a crease. Never had this happen with a pair of Sperry Topsiders before and I've been wearing them for 30 years.", "The workmanship and quality of the shoes is as expected from Sperry. The only complaint that I have is that the person who stuffed the shoe with the cardboard \"foot\" in order to preserve the shape during shipping was not very careful. Now the tongue on the right shoe is slightly creased and has a strange shape to it. Also, the shoes do run slightly large, so bear that in mind when ordering.", "My son loves them and says they are very comfy!", "Really high quality leather. Nice color. Not too bright or too dark. After 2 full days of walking around school, I broke them in. They feel great. At first, it did feel like I was walking with a monorail underneath, but that quickly went away. I mostly wear socks with these, but they look great with or without socks, and with shorts or pants. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE. I don't see anyone else wearing other boat shoe brands other than Sperry's.", "These shoes look and fit great. Exterior loses its luster pretty quickly, and when I first bought them the manmade sole had a weird hole it it that made a squeaking sound that appears to be fixed with a little wear. Not bad, could be better", "Fits very nice and matches the color in the picture perfect", "The color online, to include the Sperry website is a little deceiving, they are a lighter brown than in the photos.", "Bought these for my sweetie, he has wide feet and we thought the lace-ups would help make these fit. They look fabulous, but are still a little snug in the width. Hoping they'll continue to break in and be more comfy.", "I've been a Top-Siders fan for years. The shoe does have an excellent grip on wet surfaces. The look is also great and they are comfortable. The price on this purchase came in less than other sites, arrived on time and in good condition. Overall, a great buying experience.", "The material and fit is as expected for a Sperry shoe. However, the right sole is abominably squeaky upon purchase, as if there's a small hole somewhere letting air leak in and out. Incredibly disappointed with the quality of the build of this shoe, given the expectation of the brand.", "Poor support and really sucks as a shoe from a comfort perspective. However, fit well and no other issues.", "They didn\u2019t fit as expected, they were a bit tight. Good price and they looked really nice.", "Less than one year old and sole split across width.

My feet sweat and are brutal on shoes. Not pretty", "I would recommend this product, the shoe matches the image in color. Fit very well, I wear size 10 shoes but ordered size 9.5, not sure why but sperries seem to be a half size down for me.

VERY DISAPPOINTED.", "My husband loves them. They are bit tight but he doesn't wear socks with them so it's not an issue for him but if you plan to wear socks I would go at least a half size up.

He had i think bass brand ones before and said these are a huge step up for about 10$ more!", "LLBean and other brands of boat shoes have not lasted very long for me. I am back to Sperry again. I don't believe Sperry quality is a good as 20 years ago but they are the best for this style.", "not sure if they run small or the other shoes I compare them to run big.... they still fit fine, after break in I am confident they will be better.", "Same exact shoe and size ordered a year ago fit perfectly, and gave me a year of great service. This time, a size 10 means size 9 1/2... Someone teach China how to read a ruler!", "The shoe is true to size and really comfortable inside. The leather is a much better quality than the original version which adds to what I think will be very durable.", "Very versatile shoe that can be work to weddings, weekends on the boat, or fraternity formals.", "I have always ordered the same size from other online purveyors of footwear without a problem.

There are Chinese knock-offs who get this right, yet these pieces of junk can't?", "Nice shoe at a decent price.

Very cool and well made.", "Classic Topsider style, lasted a good amount of time. Ok without socks", "It is a fairly narrow shoe but still very well made and the iconic Sperry Top Sider", "Dependable shoe that doesn't take long to break in. Only drawback is the sole will start breaking up earlier than I like, but that's probably due to the softness needed for sure gripping on the boat deck.", "Perfect fit and super comfortable right out of the box. Soft with no break in needed.", "I've been wearing these as my everyday shoes for 36 years, on the boat and off. Nothing beats them. The leather comes all the way around under your foot and is sown together. Now with Amazon I can get them delivered right to me instead of hunting for them.

I wish I would have sent them back for a replacement.", "It fit as expected, but for some reason this show was lighter in color than any other pair my husband has bought over the years.

Very comfy and since they're available in a wide they fit better too.", "I've owned many pairs of Sperrys over the years, and these are just about exactly what you'd expect.

This year, I noticed that the shoes are squeaking an awful lot (sounds like a dog chew toy). I exchanged the shoes at Macy's a total of 4 times before I gave up. Every pair would begin squeaking after a few days of wear. I've also noticed that the shoes are thinner than before.

My feet don't slide forward jamming my toes, they don't slip off my heels and they're well cushioned, they're not too tight or too loose.

At the same time I ordered another model of Clark loafer (Cheyn Bow) in my usual 6.5M and had to exchange it for a 6.5W because was way too narrow. The 7M has a little more length and width that makes it perfect for my purpose,since they aren't too big even with cotton socks I think that this model is narrow compared to other Clarks shoes.", "As a senior citizen, I find that the toe box on shoes has to be more rounded and these shoes fit the bill. I had tried them on in a retail store but decided to order because of better pricing. The sides, at ankle, are cut lower than most in this \"bootie\" style. There is a generous elastic band at the instep which helps considerably in slipping them on, and I would judge them to be slightly larger than some Clarks in a similar style. I wore them all day right out of the box with no problems. The arch support and cushioning are very helpful in providing comfort.

I saw these and couldn't believe the price. To be honest the picture wasn't really impressive. I bought them for the quality the name carries. And wow. I love everything about these shoes. The picture does not do them justice. This is the shoe you want to take a chance on. The soft leather isn't thin or cheap. They fit like a glove. They not only look good, I know they are going to last.", "Because of recent (and more planned) surgery on one of my legs, I've noticed some swelling in my toes. So, to accommodate this, I chose the wide rather than medium width, but still in my same size otherwise. These shoes were ridiculously too large, even taking that into consideration. As I have no idea where to go from here in ordering a better size, I just decided to send them back. From now on I only plan to buy shoes that I can actually try on in the brick & mortar store. Sorry about that. I would have liked the style, but it was just too iffy trying to guess a size.", "I like this style because it looks like an ankle boot but slips on like a loafer, without the extra leather confining my ankles. Minus a star because Clarks is getting really skimpy with the cushioning and the arch support is minimal. Some Clarks can be a half size too large but this 9-1/2 got it right. The dark brown is a rich, pretty chocolate color.", "Clark's is one of my favorite brands of shoe. These did not disappoint me. They are made well, look sharp and are very comfortable. I have a narrow foot but a slim heel which makes it hard to find shoes. This shoe surrounds my foot nicely with only a little slip in the heel. I solve that by buying a heel liner for the back of my shoe. That holds my heel in place. I recommend these to anyone.", "Nice shoes ! BUT ..... for some reason the size I ordered was almost one size too small ! I only buy Clark\u2019s & I really True to size ! I have no idea why this style is running much smaller than other Clark\u2019s", "REALLY Comfortable, narrower in the heel and wider in the toe - perfect for walking/shopping. Textured Exterior is great for winter weather & working in the yard - no scuff marks!!", "I had to order a wider size after trying the regular fit. I don\u2019t understand how the shoes were wider... but I did also have to go up one full size because they did not have my original size in a wide; so they do fit. I just assumed Clark\u2019s were aimed for the elderly (no offense, truly) and for comfort. My toes felt so scrunched after wearing them at work all day, and walking around the office. Ouch! Not so comfortable. But I hope with more wear they get better, since I cannot return them now having worn them outside and around the office. Otherwise they are a very casual work shoe.", "The size 8M had a little bit of a snug fit which fit better than 8.5M since this had too much movement in heel. The size 8 was comfortable to walk but I have a high arch and the top of the shoe was hurting top of foot. I hope since leather with breaking in the shoes I hope it will stretch a bit helping the snug fit and top of foot issue I am having.", "The blue color is a bit too dark for me since I was hoping for a true navy. These look more blue black but the color has grown on me. My right foot is a half size larger than my left and while I had no problem adjusting to the fit of Clarks ankle boots this right shoe still fits slightly small even after wearing several times. I often run into the fit discrepancy with leather shoes vs boots, but I am convinced that the difference in these shoes is that the insoles are cushioned. I'm investing in a shoe stretcher at this point because I like them well enough to keep them.", "I was so intrigued by the name. I was always told this brand is so comfortable. The shoe was amazing the first week. Then, the shoes became very uncomfortable and no support with pain.", "The support is amazing and I truly must go through a dozen black shoes in my attempts to find the perfect fit for standing all day and proper alignment. These are great at the beginning of the day but the moment my feet swell, they are tight around the toe joints. I know they are leather and will stretch more in time, but I haven't completely broken them in and really hope one day they become my favourite shoe. I tend to wear medium width shoes but at this point am wishing I had ordered the wide. Otherwise, they look great with most outfits and could even be pulled off with certain dresses.", "(From Mrs. Larry) I ordered 8.5 size which is my shoe size, and measured my foot, the size chart showed 8.5, but the shoes were too narrow and tight, I should have gone to the next size, a 9. For me it is difficult to buy shoes online, without trying them on first. The shoes are really nice looking. Thankyou.", "however a 4 instead of a 5 star rating by me because the ball of my foot gets sore after a mile or so. Yes I am a long distance walker and bought these to take on a European walking vacation. in 'breaking them in\" I found the two times I wore then my foot was sore. They have a very nice solid base to walk on- but perhaps not enough cushion. I tried inserts but then they are too tight across the top of the foot above the toes. I still like them a whole lot and they are very well made and very nice looking. just may not be my \"long distance\" shoe.", "I have been wearing Clark shoes for many years - probably 20 years. This is the first \"less than 5 star\" pair I have ever owned. They are somewhat tight across the top of my foot and more narrow at the toes than any previous pair I have owned. Still, they are comfortable. The actual size \"heel to toe\" is accurate. I had hoped the leather would stretch, but after wearing them almost daily for a month, it has not yet.", "I really like the design and color of these Clarks Cheyn Madi shoes. I am currently sending them back because I have bunions and the medium is to snug. I can\u2019t wait for the 8 wide arrives. I have frequently purchased Clarks shoes and know they are a well made and stylish shoe. When I receive the wider shoes I will then give a more detail review of how well they fit.", "Super comfortable. Was worried they would look like grandma shoe like other slip on comfortable shoes are, they aren't the most stylish shoes but are so comfortable. Work at a hospital, with a job that is half office and half walking around the hospital. Was looking for shoes that would go with dress clothes but comfortable for walking around hard floors all day. These are perfect. Bought other style in an other color and they fit the same way and are also comfortable. They seem great quality and will stand up for a while. If I ever need other pair I will definitely go with Clark brand shoes.", "Great comfort! My job requires all day standing, perfect shoe for the job!", "I love Clark shoes to wear at work, however, they can be a bit pricey. Since I wear these shoes every day, I typically buy a new paid every year, which honestly I could go longer without. I've gotten a few different types of Clark's shoes and have never been disappointed but these are by far my favorite. These fit right away and didn't need much, if at all, any breaking in. They're super comfortable and provide good arch support (which is what I'm looking for when I purchase a pair of work shoes). I will definitely be purchasing these again when it is time for me to get a new pair. The price is definitely worth the quality.", "I am a sales rep for natural/specialty foods. I spend my time in grocery stores walking on tiles that are laid on cement, up and down a step stool, kneeling on floors. These are the only shoes I wear for work.

Would but again.", "I am very pleased. The fit is perfect (I ordered size I usually wear). The fit and finish is very nice. I was very leery of ordering shoes from a catalog, but this experience as far as fit and finish is concerned, is a real plus. The only thing more I could have wished for is a better arch support. it was hard to tell on the computer how much arch support there was. I will get a pair of inserts that will be just fine.", "Received these shoes and to my surprise they were in a repackaged box, which is normally okay with me, but as the pictures above show the shoes were used and dirty. The shoes show signs of extended use in the heal with worn pattern into the sole and had some dirt/stains on them. Amazon was prompt on their replacement, but beware and inspect them when you receive them. I gave them 3 stars for the inconvenience of them being used and having to return and replace because otherwise they\u2019re great shoes.", "I like Clarks, and usually they are great. Because these have elastic gores, they are loose around the instep, and don't give much arch support. When going downhill, my feet slide forward and put pressure on my toes. I could not wear them all day for walking--my feet get tired and start to hurt after a couple of hours.", "So comfy. I ordered my usual size and my feet no longer ache. I have flat feet and issues from military. These are wonderful!", "Update to my previous review. Purchased my second pair of this shoe from Amazon. Have bought six pair in the past - from Amazon and retailers. This shoe is not the same as I purchased from Amazon before. There is no heal or arch support - Only the outline of same. This shoe has been essential to my knee health, but in the future I will only purchase it retail so that I can see that the arch supports.", "This is my 4th purchase of this shoe. They look nice and are super comfortable. I wear these to work where I walk around a huge building. Look nice enough to wear with dress pants but also great with jeans. This is a great price on this shoe. I will be buying more colors. This does seem to fit more snug through the toe box area than other Clarks. They do stretch a bit with wear. Flexible and supportive.", "My feet are so happy! Comfortable fit, great inner sole, spacious toe box, good arch support. I\u2019ve been having trouble with sore feet from standing long hours and being overweight. After wearing these today, my feet and knees feel better than in weeks. Clarks for the win!", "These are really cute shoes, but my feet hurt in them by the end of day. I broke my foot almost a year ago, and find that I can't wear most of my old shoes now due to discomfort. It was quite disappointing to find that these are also not comfortable. Modest arch support, and not much cushion in the soles. Also, they run small. I usually wear a size 7; these are 7.5 and fit well. If I didn't have any foot issues, I'd give them 5 stars.", "Another great basic shoe from Clarks. I purchased the black and can wear it most anywhere. The leather style makes it dressy enough to wear with a pair of slacks to a business meeting. It is also looks good when shopping or running errands in a pair of jeans. The flat has a non-slip sole plus the style holds the foot firmly. For me, who sometimes has trouble walking, this is a good \"safe\" shoe to wear. It's a good, \"all purpose\" shoe that I can wear comfortably all day.", "I just got these shoes and started wearing them, but I can tell they are going to be my favorite fall shoes. They fit to size perfectly, and they look great. They seem very comfortable, which is the main thing for me. I have a little trouble with the balls of my feet, but these have plenty of cushion and I don't feel any pressure. Not all Clarks fit me this well or are this comfortable, so I am pleased.", "I had bought a pair of these before at a shoe store so I knew exactly how they fit and what they felt like. I knew I loved the shoe, but the store couldn't order anymore for me in my size. So I found them online at amazon at a good price, and it was a no-brainer to order two more pairs in two colors I did not have yet. Love love love these shoes. Clarks. Well-made, good looking, super good fit. I am grateful I could get these.", "The perfect teacher shoe! I walk miles each day and my feet feel great wearing these shoes. I have them in black and they go with any outfit - dress up or down. I wish I had them in every color. Be careful because I somehow ordered them in navy by accident the first time. The return was easy though- no problems. I highly recommend these shoes. I have a narrow foot so I can wear a nice warm thick sock with them in winter.", "These are a great looking pair of the most uncomfortable Clark\u2019s I\u2019ve ever worn.

I did research on the best shoes for travelers who walked a lot. Over and over I would read or watch videos and Clark\u2019s were always mentioned.

Do some research and you will see you can\u2019t go wrong with this brand of shoes.", "I love Clark's, but this pair is AWFUL! Do not buy! There is a large nylon zigzag seam running across the inside, in the middle of the toe box/front of shoe. On the right shoe it doesn't hurt, but on the left side it's abrasive and rubs the skin off even through your socks.! Hate these!!!!", "I accidentally ordered wide width and didn't figure it out till I wore them to work. I cannot figure out how to return them or if there's any exchange latitude since it's past the 30 day timeframe. I called Clark's and they said they'd prefer that I go through Amazon first. But I cannot figure out a route, and it is so frustrating that there is no option for a phone call to customer service. I am OFF of Amazon over these stupid shoes.", "Wonderful shoes. I just tried them on and they fit perfect. I ordered the 9 medium width. My feet are narrow and they fit nicely but snug. I might think twice about ordering these, if you have wide feet. Length is perfect For me and the toe box has plenty of room for my very sensitive toes. This is LOVE!! I am always looking for a shoe to work in because I am on my feet a lot. I am actually excited to try these for a work shoe.", "I\u2019ve been looking for a comfortable WIDE shoe for my job as a respiratory therapist. I\u2019m on my feet most of my 12 hour shift and need support and shoes I can wear with thick cushioned socks. These are terrific!!! Already ordered a second pair. Width is good but toe box a shade on the tight side...I also like to wear thick socks so that may have something to do with it. I normally wear a 7W but ordered a half size bigger to accommodate the socks. As close to perfect as I\u2019ve found since Clark\u2019s stopped making the Wave Walk shoe I wore for many years. That they\u2019re cute is a great bonus!!!", "Purchased these shoes to find some relief from my 10hr shifts at my retail job and considering I've bought plenty of Clarks before, I was unimpressed. Out of just unboxing them I knew they were going to be mediocre. Theres no plush inner sole like other Clark's shoes [all my flats are plush :)] & they also fit very tight. Even after exchanging for the larger size, thinking that was the problem, the heel part isn't comfortable enough for long hours. Day 2 I felt as if my old heel spur returned. Unfortunately will have to continue my search.", "They felt great when I first put them on but after wearing a couple hours I wanted to take them off. There is so padded in the shoe for shock absorbing or comfort. They do seem to give the foot support but I am again looking for a comfortable semi flat shoe. I was disappointed as I expected more from Clark\u2019s. I would not buy again but for now they serve the purpose.", "Shoe fit narrow even though it was the normal width I ordered. In addition, the side of right foot of shoes is defective as it is already separating before I even start wearing it. I am very disappointed.", "Bought these to wear on the job as a school crossing guard. My doctor told me I had a neuroma in my foot. It was very painful. I was told I needed to ditch the shoes I was using because of the lack of arch support. I bought these with high hopes they\u2019d be a good replacement, but the soles are too bendable and I need more arch support than these gave me. They seem well, there\u2019s not enough support.", "I love Clarks shoes. But this pair has the left shoe about a 1/4 inch longer than the right shoe. It is more a size 8.5 than the 8 which is what I ordered. Both shoes have the size tag 8W in the shoes. And since I tried wearing these shoes, I can no longer return them. I did order another pair, which fits perfectly. I did notice that the word \"Collection\" on the labels don't match the labels in the 1st pair that didn't fit. Did the label styles get changed?", "I usually purchase Danskos for work but heard good things about Clarks and decided to give these a shot. This is a nice looking shoe but I had to return since it was too constricting around my toes and I was afraid it would press on my pinky toe after a long day of standing/walking.", "I own several pairs of Clark shoes and love them. After reading reviews I was a bit skeptical about the size and fit, but decided to go with the size of my other shoes and am glad I did. Had I gone up a half size the arch would have been off. As it is, these shoes have a nice snug fit without being too tight. I wore them all day the first day I got them and there was no \u201cbreak-in\u201d required. They fit and felt great from the moment I put them on until I took them off. Besides, they look great with jeans!", "I work at the airport and needed black shoes without laces. I would recommend ripping the insoles out and getting some good supporting insoles for the inside. Overall they're very good. However, when it's raining, there's very little traction especially when walking on wet metal stairs. If you need lots of traction, look for something else. There isn't much rain where I live so I can use these just fine. I recommend them if you're on your feet a lot.", "These shoes fit very comfortably at first wear. I wore them to Rome, Italy. They did not provide enough shock absorption from walking on stone for up to 8 hours each day. The soles of my feet were very sore, but I did not get any blisters. That must say something about the quality. Now that I\u2019m home, I wear them to work every day. I love them and would encourage anyone to purchase-just not for a trip to Italy!", "I tend to have issues with any shoe that has even a slight heel due to my hip, but these Clarks were perfect. The first day of breaking in the shoes at work, I ended up having to walk a lot more than usual, but even with that my feet did not hurt at all. The only thing I would like different is the tread on the bottom is not the best far as slip proof.", "If ever you need a comfortable and great looking shoe, the Cheyn Madi is it! I bought a pair in brown from a shoe store and after wearing them a few times, I ordered black ones in the same size and style. I have wide width feet and these fit like a dream! It didn't hurt me a bit that I bought these on Amazon at a great price (1/2 of what I paid in the store). Get some now!", "I'm a Clarks shoe user (I usually wear higher wedges) and these have by far been my favorites. They are made with premium materials and are super comfortable. My past 2 pairs of Clarks have came apart at the seams on top, but I don't believe I'll have that issue with these as the leather is comparable to premium leather (I'm sure it's not, but it sure feels like it). If you like Clarks or want comfortable flats give these a try!", "After reading all of the rave reviews I decided to give a pair of \"Clark Shoes\" a try. I'm difficult to satisfy when it comes to shoes: if they aren't completely comfortable, I won't wear them. In the 2 weeks since these arrived, these are the shoes I wear with slacks!! Clark's has a new customer! I wish I'd known about during my 45 years as an RN.", "I have the EXACT same shoe and size, but these, even though they were marked 7M were way to narrow for my feet. Disappointed in the fit.", "I purchased these through Amazon Wardrobe, so I got to try on a pair before committing. I wish I had ordered a size smaller during the 'try it on' period. The pair I bought were a tiny bit loose - I probably could have gone down another 1/2 a size. But I wore thick socks, and they were fine. The arch support and cushioning were great while I tromped around castles and museums in England.", "I really love these shoes. I wore them for the first time Sunday to preach in and they didn't hurt my feet at all. They are dressy enough for church but as comfortable as sneakers. I may have to buy another pair in black!", "I like these comfortable shoes. I usually wear a 7B, but I read reviews and decided on a 7.5, because I always wear medium thicknesses cotton socks. I also added thin insoles with a little bit more arch support. My aging feet need space for the toes and the half size up seems good. The shoes are real leather with flexible rubber soles. The soles leave black marks on freshly polished school floors, so I hope that stops with use.", "I had a pair of these that I totally wore out. It was so happy to find they are still available. I get the 7.5 Wide, which gives more than enough room for bunions but isn't too big, so I'm swimming in them. I hope they keep making them - their my favorite Go To pant shoe.", "These shoes feel great. Comfortable for my planter facetious. One negative is that I purchased the wide width, but I can't wear socks. They fit perfectly with bare feet. Waking in these shoes is very comfy. I'm going to buy another color, I like them so much. Love that they slip on so easily too.", "I'm a clarks fan and these shoes are perfect for work. I wear them almost every day to work. They are so comfortable that you can't even tell they are slip-ons. They have little to no arch support which I love as I have a flat foot and these do not hurt my feet like some shoes that have the high arch support.", "If your foot does run a little wide, order wide. That being said, this shoe is very comfortable and works perfectly for my workday outfits. Very pleased! Very comfortable in even first wear. No blisters/rubbing! Great support. Would order again. Can\u2019t go wrong with Clarke\u2019s.", "Like other here, I have some orthopedic issues and work in a setting that I need shoes that are supportive, comfortable, and cannot be super casual. I really like the value, material, and style of these. I can stand and walk in these for long periods of time without issue. I hope to get more of these in more colors.", "Ordering shoes online is tricky at best. Specially ones with special features such as the arch supports. I tried these on, they fit great and straight out of the box I was able to wear them all day with no issues. I will be ordering a brown pair soon. The arch support really helps my feet feel better.", "I love these shoes, I would love for every shoe I own to feel this good on and look this good. I have a wide foot and a bunion, purchased a Medium thinking it might not feel good but it feels perfect and I have worn these without socks and with socks, sometimes the wide width is too wide. Can't say enough good things about them, thinking about buying another color.", "I'm a long-time Merrill shoe wearer, but wanted to get away from them for various reasons. I hoped to switch to Clark but there was just no comparison as far as support was concerned. Merrill is still the best. I would have kept these anyway, but had to return as they are just too loose.", "As always, the Clark brand delivers: Good quality construction and fit. The only thing I would change is to allow the liner to be removed to do an orthotic insert to support higher arch. Still, best shoe I've acquired in a couple of years.", "They are a little snug but my feet are also swollen right now. I feel like if I ordered the 8 1/2 they would've been too big once the swelling went down so the size 8 was perfect for me. They are so extremely comfortable and I can even wear them without socks which is nice. Best pair of shoes to wear with your jeans! I love them!", "Rarely find a Clarks shoe that does not WOW me. Love this comfy style. Takes a few wearings to break these in, but you won\u2019t be disappointed. I wore my other pair out, much too comfortable which may have been the reason I needed to adjust. Love this style. Classic comfy.", "So I have tons of cute shoes and every pair I wore to work were killing me by the end of the day....until I got these! I lasted all day and even had them on at home for awhile. They are a bit loose, wish they had a 10.5. Im 5'11' and 250- finding shoes with comfort is a must.", "I ordered probably a dozen pairs of black flats and returned them. These are PERFECT. They are easy to slip on, they are comfortable to wear and walk in. They clean easily and aren't too hot (or cold). I can wear them to the office or just out and about. SUPER happy with this purchase, especially for the price I paid.", "I have been wearing Clark's brand shoes for 30 years . These shoes are of the consistent high quality I have come to expect from Clatks. The only suggestion I would offer is that I would like to see these with a bit more arch support and cushioning in the footbed .", "Shoes are extremely comfortable as expected. However, after only 10 uses the elastic on strap has stretched out to the point where the shoes are sliding off my heel. Since I only wore them rarely the return period has expired. Would expect shoes from this company to last longer then 10 uses.", "Needed a basic black shoe to be worn with socks during the winter. I went up a half size to accommodate for socks. I wear my regular size with thin socks or hose in the warmer months. Toe box is great, instep is great, very nice basic black casual slip on shoe.", "I really like the fit of these shoes. This is my second pair (I have them in brown and black). I like the crinkle black over the smooth although they both look good. Very high quality leather and great for walking around in.", "These shoes are not very pretty, they have a wide front, which was actually why I bought them. I wanted a pair of quality comfy shoes and I didn't mind if they looked ugly. The problem is, the front part of the shoe is actually the most uncomfortable part. I would normally sacrifice looks for comfort (and sometimes vice versa), but these shoes are meh on both fronts.", "Love Clark shoes, because of how they fit. These fit nice but for some reason these just have not held up well. They are not lasting like my other ones I have purchased. I have a sit down job I only walk in and out of my office . There is no reason they should be looking all worn out as they do. I can not give these Clarks a 5 star.", "Love these shoes! I bought them before traveling in Europe for a dressier look than my hiking shoes. I walked all over London in them and didn\u2019t even think about my feet, which was a huge relief. They have been holding up well and I couldn\u2019t be happier.", "I bought two pair of these shoes for work and they fit as though they were custom made for me! I wear trouser socks with them and although they're not a showy shoe, they are attractive with my slacks. Love Clark's shoes!", "I wear these Monday thru Friday to work. I have to walk 2 blocks from where I park. These shoes are very comfortable. I would definitely buy again. I have even thought about getting a pair to put up in case they don\u2019t have them when I need them. They are that comfortable to me.", "These shoes are extremely comfortable with lots of padding. They were easy to wear from the the first time. I like the darker brown and the styling. My only complaint is that my heel is very narrow so my heel slips a little. I have to wear socks.", "These shoes were a great fit from the moment I put them on. No \"breaking in\" period. They fit like an old comfy pair, but provide plenty of support. Love that the heel isn't real high. Worn a lot already, but they still look like new!", "I loved everything about these shoes until I was a couple months into wearing these all day everyday for 12 or more hours at work and a crazy schedule, after awhile my foot pain came back with vengeance. I do think I\u2019ll stick with my cloud steppers. Those are heaven sent!!", "This shoe arrived quickly and fit very well. Although I could really use a size 11.5, this one was a great fit not too big and not too small. If you really need a size 12, this could end up being a little tight. I'm able to wear these comfortably with socks.", "Clark\u2019s are one of the few shoes I can order online and count on them fitting properly with my orthotics. However, I do wish they came with removable insoles instead of ones that are glued from heel to toe - very difficult to remove.", "For first 20 minutes I thought they were going to be too tight, but by the end of our dinner gathering I realized they had stretched out and were quite comfy. I have very wide feet and issues with plantar fasciitis, so I\u2019m very excited to have a comfortable shot that\u2019s not a tennis shoe!", "I wanted a closed toe, all leather, low heal shoe. Found these on sale so I figured why not. They were comfortable right out of the box, though they don't have much arch. They seem well made, but I think they look a bit frumpy.", "I have several pairs of Clark's shoes but these feel so good to wear. Sometimes their other shoes rub on the back of my foot and after wearing for several days in a row I end up with a raw spot. Not so with these. They look great and I even took a 20 minute walk in them at lunch. They were THAT good. I purchased the 9W. They were true to size.", "Love these shoes! I'm on the wide side of a medium width, and these are just right. I tried them on when they arrived and wore them for a few minutes. Then I wore them all day at work, and at no point did I feel like I needed to take them off! That never happens! Love the way they look, too!", "These fit quite comfortably right out of the box. I wear a 7 1/2 regular width, which is what I ordered. I work in a hospital and am on my feet all day and I never had a problem with needing to break them in or anything. Will buy again!", "Very comfortable. I usually can wear a size 8.5 with stockings and a size 9 with socks comfortably but with these shoes I had to wear a size 9 to be comfortable in stockings and socks are a little bit tight. It's leather though so it stretches just enough to be okay. These are true Clarks in that they have held up to regular wear thru months of use.", "The best thing about these shoes is that they are comfortable. I ordered mine in a Wide and am very happy with them. I usually wear a medium (although sometimes mediums are a little too tight and wides are too loose in the same model shoe), but wanted a shoe that was more roomy and does not press down on my toes and sides of my feet. They look nice and last a long time. These are my second pair.", "Love these shoes, they just happen to fit my foot like they were made especially for me. They are form fitting they're not loose they're not tight they come up to a perfect level just under my ankle, I really like them", "Well that\u2019s an OK shoe, it still hurts my feet a little bit but it\u2019s better than the other shoes that I ordered I sent them back already but I can only wear this to work I don\u2019t think I can walk a lot in them they\u2019re not quite as comfortable as I expected them to be... you live and learn this was the first pair of Clarks I\u2019ve ever bought and I probably won\u2019t buy anymore .", "I specifically bought these shoes for a trip to Portugal in the rainy winter. I rambled up and down wet, mossy, cobble-stoned streets with confidence. No slips, no falls! The shoes were comfy all day long and paired well with jeans or black pants. I would buy these again in a heartbeat!", "I am on my feet all day. These shoes are comfortable and do not hurt my feet. I have narrow feet with high arches and arthritis in my feet. It makes finding comfortable shoes that look good near to impossible. I love these shoes.", "Love these shoes. Sooo comfortable. I am on my feet up to 11 hours a day at work and these shoes feel just as good at the end of the day . I got 10 wide and they feel like a hug for my feet. I expect to get years of comfort wear. Very well made. I will probably get another pair.", "I bought these because I got a job where I am on my feet all day. But, my feet hurt like crazy only a couple hours into the day. They were a bit too tight and the support was weird. I hobbled. I don't have time to break shoes in. The interim hardship is just too much. OUCH!", "I like the shoes, I needed something quick for an interview, and I\u2019d like to look at these. Issue might be better if it had more arch support in a little more cushion. But for now they\u2019re exactly what I need", "I always buy Clark shoes. These fit perfectly and were comfortable for all day wear (standing for 8 straight) right out of the box. I have plantar fasciitis in my right foot so I need shoes with proper cushion and support. Clark delivers again. At a very reasonable price compared to their website or their higher end shoes.", "Clark's is my favorite shoe company. They still use real leather and resilient supportive foam. Their shoes wear well and are extremely comfortable. This shoe is no different. It fits well, is comfortable, and looks great.", "I'm a solid 7.5 and the 7.5 fit me perfectly. These feel so comfortable, really like them and will be perfect this fall. Got the black at an excellent sale price.... they arrived with a Dr. Scholl's insole in one of the shoes and what looks like little animal hairs. Not sure how I feel about that, obviously a return. The shoes are in otherwise great condition but I may re-order and send these back.", "Love these shoes but could have ordered a half size up for toe area. I will wear these and stretch them out a bit on one foot. Normally wear 7 size. I have worked in them but wouldn\u2019t stand all day in them.", "As with any Clark\u2019s footwear, this shoe is perfect! I was hesitant about buying these without trying them on first but took a chance. I have neuropathy and bunions. I am a first grade teacher and rarely sit down. These shoes were amazing right out of the box! Size was perfect!", "I love these shoes, they fit perfect, nice cushion insole. They have a nice shine and will work great as dress shoes for work or Church.", "Got this clog because it was the closest to one of their clogs that I love. Was too stiff and tighter than the other shoe I loved even though the same size. Was a bit disappointed and wish I had not thrown away box and ordered a size up.", "I have 4 pairs of these,and wear them in the house.They are comfortable and have great support.I would recommend them.I actually have a pair in half size larger in order to wear two pairs of socks in winter!", "I like the shoe overall, but the fit is wide and my foot is narrow. The toe box is so wide that I have a simple in the leather cause my feet aren't large enough to fit the gap. And no arch support at all. The pic gives the appearance of support but true fit does not.", "I ordered a size 10 and they fit closer to a 9 1/2. I've worn this brand about 10 years and never had problems before.", "I ordered 6.5 and my foot is 9 1/8 inches long. You have to measure your foot when you are standing on it. I needed a black pair of casual shoes. These shoes are well made and just what I hoped for.", "Purchased the wide size and it didn't fit, was just as narrow as the normal size.", "Normally Clarks shoes fit great and got to size, but this pair was smaller and the leather was very hard. If you really like the design of this particular shoe, my advice would be to go a size larger.", "I've never owned a Clark shoe before. It was a risk I'm glad I made. The shoe is comfortable, unaware I had new shoes on my feet! They look and feel well made. May they last as long as my previous \"go to shoe\" that is no longer available.", "I like these. they don't give me the cushion and support I was looking for but they are much better than the BOC shoes I had. They felt fine on but by the end of the day when I took them off, my feet ached for hours. Took me awhile to figure out it was the BOC shoes but when I did, I chunked them fast! No more icing my feet and ibuprofen to sleep.", "Ordered a 9M US and they were a a good half-inch too long, even though the last Clarks shoes I ordered were the same size and fit well. The size inside was labeled 6.5 UK, which is supposed to be equivalent to a US size 9. Not what I ordered. I returned them. The quality is okay for the price, but not quite as much comfort padding at the heel and inside as previous Clarks shoes I have owned.", "Love Clark's shoes & these don't disappoint! I have lots of ankle boots, fur lined boots and sandals but wanted just a pair of good leather comfortable shoes to slip on in the winter or cooler months and these fit the bill! They are really comfortable right out of the box and getting them for at least $25.00 less than other retailers (QVC) is an added bonus...thank you Amazon Prime!!!", "Love the shoes,I only wish that a thicker insert could be used and the shoes are just a pinch too tight in the top of the vamp. Not so much that you can't bear to wear them,I wear these all day at work.", "They are nice,sensible work shoes,for the office.Not sur if I'd choose them for a ton of walking.Haven't gotten scratched yet look good and the diagonal bit hides creasing.Im happy with it.", "Love these shoes. The only reason it received 4 stars is because it\u2019s a little snug at first. Not really a great grip on tile flooring either. Otherwise comfortable and well worth the price. I would buy again.", "These shoes are just what I wanted/ordered and more. The delivery was prompt and quick as promised. Coming actual sight unseen, no hassle, perfectly packaged and being just right- they look good, feel good and are keepers. Thank you Amazon\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a", "I started with 8 1/2 wide, 8 wide and ended woth 7 1/2 wide which seems odd because I've been wearing 81/2 med but are to tight, I split the sides on a pair. Happy to finally get a pair that I hope will last a while.", "I'm on my feet every single day 40 plus hrs. a week and I have to say that these shoes are pretty comfy. I'm 5 '5\" tall I weigh 135 lbs but walk hard like a 250 lb. woman so I'm real hard on my poor feet. The only critic would be they need a little more cush other than that they are a great shoe.", "Comfortable and stylish leather shoes just as expected with Clarks. I say they're somewhat small because I rarely fail to have a perfect fit in an 8.5 of any shoes except Nike. However these 8.5s are at least a bit snug here at the beginning. The size 9 slipped on my right heel. A bit of wearing and stretching should be fine.", "I had my last pair of these for 1.5 years and wore them to work every single day (I'm a veterinarian on my feet all day). They are SUPER comfortable and don't require breaking in. I had to replace my last pair because the decorative clasp finally broken and the soles were wearing out. Pretty good durability for a pair of shoes that cost less than $60!", "I have arthritis in both feet and needed some dress shoes to wear for a conference These did the trick Stylish and comfortable", "I absolutely love these shoes by Clark this is my second pair and they are so comfortable and fit very well toe bed is perfect for my funky looking toes just love them", "Cute shoe but it runs small and narrow so I returned two pairs and ordered the same shoes just a 1/2 larger than I usually wear. I wear Clarks almost exclusively and the size is almost always accurate; however, this particular shoe is not. Just order a bit larger and keep in mind that this shoe runs narrow.", "I consistently wear size 9-1/2 M. This shoe was too way too long and extremely narrow. Went to the physical Clark's store and every shoe I tried on which fit was a size 8 Wide. I haven't taken a size 8 in over 30 yrs. Glad I went to the store so now I'll know what size to order online. These have to go back but the Clark's I bought at the store are very nice and help my foot discomfort so other than the size the shoes are great!", "A little tighter than other Clarks styles I have of the same size, but they wore in nicely. I wear these nearly every day for work with my scrubs. Nicer looking than other clog type shoes. My puppy chewed the tassel off one of them so I just removed the straps on both and they look fine without them, but not quite as cute!", "The shoe is great until I have to walk more than a few steps. The top of the shoe has no give and really hurt my foot when I tried to wear it all day on vacation. My feet were so sore I can barely walk the next day. If you have a high arch do not order these", "Soft leather shoe. I have narrow feet and these are perfect. Soft and supportive insole. Normally wear 6 1/2 but I sized up after reading reviews\u2014\u2014mistake. True to sizzle for me. Gripping sole", "I loved the look of these and you can\u2019t beat the price. These have enough cushion for the heel, which is where I put most of my weight. But I felt there\u2019s hardly any cushion for the rest of my foot. There\u2019s not support for the rest of my feet so I plan on buying insoles for the shoe. Other than that they\u2019re fine.", "I expected to love this shoe as I am a big fan of Clarks. Unfortunately there is something very wrong with the sizing. I went up a 1/2 size from my usual as recommended by others , and these shoes were still very tight across the middle/top of my foot. I exchanged for the next size up, which left me with a good fit on one and flopping off on the other. I made sure I didn\u2019t receive one wide one by accident. All around a bad fit. Sorry Clark\u2019s, I usually love your shoes!", "I love these shoes, however, the left shoe is too tight in the toe area, and it HURTS. I will be contacting to see about a return or exchange, as it's too painful to wear them.", "Clark\u2019s shoes are one of my favorite brands as they are comfortable and usually hold up really well! This style is great for casual wear, but also looks good with skirts. I find that Amazon has some really great prices on Clark\u2019s shoes and I often get mine here!", "These shoes are perfect! I ordered them mainly because they came in Narrow and I liked the color. I don't ordinarily order shoes online. These are the most comfortable shoe I think I have ever had and I am 69. I \ud83d\udc98love love them. They are comfortable and I love the way they look. I get tons of compliments!", "Very happy with these shoes. Other Clarks shoes I have ordered have had serious sizing errors but these are fine and look as pictured. Finally a pair I do not have to return.", "Really love these shoes. They are a little on the comfortably snug side, but that\u2019s okay for me. But I have a narrow to avg foot width. I\u2019m assuming there\u2019ll stretch a little.", "I have a bunion on my right foot, and Clarks shoes are still comfortable just off the box. This shoe is just a wee bit narrower that I expected; despite that, I was able to wear it to work right off the box, and experienced no discomfort. It is a classy-looking shoe!", "I love these shoes! I always find dress shoes to be uncomfortable, however these were comfortable the very first time I wore them. They also look great with dress pants.", "Like the style. Purchased size 8 W as a gift for friend with high arch. However, the fit is a minimum of size 9. I Normally wear a 9 and the shoes are actually loose on me. Was going to return them but decided I\u2019d keep them for myself and wear when I am wearing thicker winter socks. Nonslip soles are true nonslip. Nice.", "This is my 3rd pair purchased. I am so happy to have found shoes that work for me. I am surprised of the fit. Ordered an 12M and I wear 11.5M. I feel the shoe runs small. I like the comfort and the wide box foot bed. I would recommend these shoes. I can even fit my half shoe orthodics.", "Love these shoes! Very comfortabe. Replace my black clark shoes, unfortunately no longer made. These have no velcro strap to tight them, but the side elastic works me. Look nearly identical.", "They fit perfectly when I put them on. After wearing them all day, my right foot felt a little numb. But I know they will be fine. Just need a little breaking in.", "Arrived earlier than expected. The shoes are true to size and width as described . The workmanship is very well done. The shoes are easy to put on and wonderfully comfortable ! Love them !!", "My friend has a pair of these shoes in black and wanted another in navy. We found them on Amazon, ordered them and she had them within two days. She absolutely loves them!", "Toes feel tight and i have narrow feet. No sole support for hard floors in a kitchen more than 8hrs and i walk home up a hill ..i thought i was going to die the balls of me feet ache so badly ..sad cause they are good looking shoes.", "Perfect for me. Great shoe and comfortable. I should note, however, that I use orthotics (half) and tend to wear a slightly thicker wool sock. If you are in a different circumstance, you might find it a bit wide. Probably nothing that couldn't be addressed with an insole.", "I ordered wide and it looks like it is a normal shoe. They don't have a wide toe box. That being said I could stretch my toes out and they are quite comfortable.", "Tried 8 regular in store and they were just right in length but tight across the metatarsal bone. Ordered 8 wide thinking they would be what I needed.When they arrived , I knew right away they were going to be way too big. They swallowed my foot in length. I am able to insert 3 fingers behind my heel while I have them on. Out of curiosity, I visited my local Belk store and did a size comparison. The 8 wides that I ordered are the same length as a 9 1/2 regular in the store. WHAT GIVES ?????", "Perfect style for me. A bit snug, so I ordered 1/2 size larger for my thick socks. Will keep this one for thin socks.", "I\u2019m a big fan of Clark\u2019s but I absolutely love these shoes. Wore them as soon as got them. Wore them for 8 hours and they were still comfortable.", "I bought these for my mom and I usually have to buy wide because her feet swell. She really liked them so I also bought them in brown.", "I love Clark shoes and these were comfy right out of the box...no need to break them in to enjoy. Not sure I would ever wear them with skirts, but they look great with slacks and jeans.", "These shoes just happened to pop up in my Amazon feed and they were exactly what I was looking for. A nice casual shoe with the fit and feel of a slip on sneaker. I'm normally very hard to fit - wide instep and narrow heel, but these are perfect and very comfortable. I love them and will look for more Clark shoes now that I know how they fit.", "You get consistent quality with Clark's. I've never been disappointed. The style's a bit frumpy, but that's on me. They look exactly like the photo. I wanted comfortable, everyday shoes. Exactly what I received.", "These shoes are very comfortable. I have several pairs of Clarks and have always had very good luck with them. I have a tendency to wear the same shoes everyday and they have always held out very well.", "I adore these shoes for their style and comfort. They are great for casual and business wear. There were no surprises with this purchase, only satisfaction.", "These did not fit. I ordered a size 9. I wear an 8.5. They were to narrow/tight.", "Comfy. Wide toe box. I\u2019ve started ordering up a half size in Clark\u2019s to give my toes more room. These don\u2019t slip on the heels either. Only complaint is that the wrinkly black leather (forgot what they call it) doesn\u2019t look as well made as a smoother version. The wrinkles do probably hide wear though.", "I needed a new pair of brown shoes and I always do well when I buy Clarks. They never seem to need to be broken in. I put them on when they arrive and I can wear them all day without worrying about blisters. They are well made and I love the style.", "I climb a lot of stairs. and there is no competion. 35 flights of stairs and no back or leg pain. these shoes are pricless.", "Perfect for persons who walk a lot on the job. My feet are slim and it gave me a sleek snug fit that wasn\u2019t tight even when wearing trouser socks. It\u2019s also does a good job in rainy weather; in light rain I can do without swapping them for rain boots.", "Good sturdy somewhat stylish shoe with good support. Leather is not pebble leather (which is much softer for tender feet) but once they break in they are perfect for shopping and standing in long lines..", "After 8 months of wearing these almost every day, they're still incredibly comforable. Great for my office/lab environment where I need to look professional but still be on my feet in the lab.", "Perfect!! Love Clarks shoes!! So comfortable!! True to size. I would highly recommend. I would buy again. Thank you.", "Toe area is off. Hard to explain but I did not keep the shoe.", "My first Clark\u2019s shoes after living in Clark\u2019s clogs. Normally wear 8 but needed an 8.5 for these! Great, comfortable shoes that can be worn in many situations!", "This shoe is very comfortable and looks nice, not clunky. The side elastic inserts are perfect for people like me with a narrow foot and a high instep.", "I work in retail and stand/walk for up to 6 hrs a day. This shoe like, like my other Clarks shoes, are comfortable and attractive. A great work/casual shoe.", "Clarks are my favorite shoes hands down. I have several styles and I love them all, these included! I can walk for hours with no foot or leg fatigue and I think they are very fashionable.", "I purchased these a half size larger. They feel wonderful. Very cushioning. Right out if the box they were comfortable. Enough room to wear with socks.", "I wore the shoes for 10 hours with a lot of walking involved and I have no complaints, no blisters, no pain and I'm glad I bought them. They feel great on and have needed support not only to help my feet but, my back too, after 2 surgeries that's definitely needed. Great product & reasonable price too.", "The outer layer appears to be strong enough that when my right leg drags it does not wear away the skin of the shoe. This is very good. The fit is a little tight but since I mostly am seated in a power chair they are not so tight as to be a problem. If I was walking I would need a half size larger.", "So thankful for the wide sizing! Very comfortable shoe to wear while on my feet all day and I haven't had any slipping or blisters.", "These are very comfortable shoes however this is the 2nd pair that I have purchased that the sole cracks. I just purchased the 2nd pair on Nov 19, 2019 & I maybe wear them 2 times a week at most & the sole is already cracked. So disappointing.", "These look nice - great quality- and they are comfortable. I wore them all day the first time I put them on. They don\u2019t need to be \u2018broken in\u2019.", "They have a weird fit. Just inside your foot at the arch, it rubs on your foot. They just dont fir right. Took them on vacation and was dying after 4 hours. Not blisters, just a weird fit on the inside arch made them painful to wear.", "These Clark's are good shoes, but were a bit tight, so I returned them. The same style \"bootie\" (also the Clark's brand) fit much better.", "I love my new shoes and got wide width. The wide width fits great right now but if it stretches it may get a little big. I would buy again because they are very comfortable.", "I wanted to wear this shoe for work but I\u2019m not happy with it. I think it\u2019s ok for casual walking but not for my job. I typically walk from 8500 steps to 12500 steps per day, sometimes more. After 6 to 8 hours I have to change the shoes because there just isn\u2019t enough support. I\u2019ll have to keep looking for a better walking shoe.", "This is my third pair and about the only shoe, other than boots or sneakers, that I will wear. Very comfortable, soft leather with good support.", "Ordered my normal clarks size and these were too short and too tight. Sizing way off on these.", "I was looking for a travel shoe that also was dressy enough for pants, could handle snow, and still light enough to travel in. These shoes exceeded my expectations. They have become my every day shoes!", "Great shoe but order half size larger and wider than you usually wear other than that the shoes are extremely comfortable and durable.", "Very comfortable and as expected, great shoe from Clarke. I like to wear these in the winter, and this is a great one to buy.", "I was very excited to find these shoes this price. I ordered a 7 1/2 but when I got them they were small so I had to return them and get an 8. I\u2019m glad I did because now they fit perfect and they are very comfortable. I would\u2019ve given the shoe five stars but since the size was not true to fit I had to get a four", "These were bought for an upcoming trip to Italy, Fast to take off for TSA. My second pair. I love these! We walk, walk, walk every day in Fireneze. I have a knee replacement and I need a good shoe. Fast delivery, fabulous fit.", "This is my second pair of this Clarks shoe. They are so comfortable I wear them all day at the office then walk the dog in them at night. I actually prefer them to my pricey Brooks running shoes.", "Quality made shoe with good arch support. Runs slightly wide in the heel; but even I with a narrow heel find they stay on just fine.", "Very comfy. Havent worn them all day yet. I have really bad feet. So wearing a shoe for a couple of hours is a huge feat. I really like this shoe. And the price. Delivery was prompt", "The shoes arrived on time and I love the fit, however, there is a scuff mark right on the top of one of them! They were wrapped in tissue paper - nothing was torn so obviously it was done before it was packed. :-(", "I was looking for a shoe with good arch support and stability. This was not it. It looked and felt cheap, and the insoles had no cushioning.", "Fits great on my foot and supports my foot very well. Feet don\u2019t get sore or feel jammed inside. I have slightly wider feet and they feel great.", "My wife loves the way Clark\u2019s shoes fit and their durability. She is ecstatic that Amazon has these for almost $20 less than local stores sell them.", "Always been a Clark's fan, always will be!! Excellent price, super comfortable and very durable!!", "It's narrow but fit exactly. If your going to purchase buy a size little bigger. For example if your size is 7 buy size 8 instead.", "Fit just slightly tight but Clarks in the past tent to stretch out a bit.", "I loved the shoe but for some reason it felt tied. I was going to return them but my daughter tried them and they fit her just right so she kept them.", "Really like the shoes. They are great for work. I am a size 8 have white feet and they fit loose so I can wear socks on cold days.", "I was worried that these would not fit because I have a high instep along with a wide width.

I mean overall I guess it's a pretty good knockoff. Looks pretty similar to the real ones.

Tight at first but after 2 wks have stretched and are perfect. Very warm but not too hot even for indoor wear. They did get wet wearing in snow so I allowed to dry, brushed them and applied Bickmore Gard-More. Wore in snow again and stayed clean and dry. Black dye does stain feet and socks heavily at first but that is lessening with time. If the soles, stitching, etc. prove durable I will be very happy with these boots!", "Love, love, love the boot BUT, believe other reviewers when you read that they run far larger than what you'd usually wear. I, without fail, wear a size 6 boot. Ordered a 6 in this and found that they were far too big. A 5 would have been perfect. Unfortunately, I had purchased the boot on a mega \"one day only\" sale through Amazon and then found that Amazon won't allow you to exchange them for a different size. By the time the boots arrived, the sale was long over and I was unable to get them for the same price. VERY disappointed with Amazon over this policy. Makes absolutely no sense. Boots were returned.", "I ordered my usual size even though reviews said these boots would stretch. In the past I ordered a smaller size anticipating stretching, but the boots never were comfortable for extended wear. These boots are great to look at, easy to put on and take off and will be very nice to have this cold winter. They have the good lining and a removable foot bed. If the boots do stretch I will just add some thick winter socks and all will be well. They fit well now and do not ride up on the heels when walking. I recommend them.", "I purchased these for $50 as an Amazon gold box deal and got exactly what I knew I was getting: really ugly hunky big boots that feel like heaven on your feet. You can roll down the top for a slightly improved fashion statement. I get compliments and feel funny cause I honestly think they're huge and ugly! But still love how comfortable they are. Don't forget to waterproof them, especially if they are light in color. After a day in heels, these are what I want to go out in. I'm usually closer to a 9 than an 8 but went down and was happy with that decision.", "I have an 8W foot. I purchased the 8 and they have little slippage in the heel. I wear the Hanes sock (crew) with them plus have my jeans tucked in (Jane Doe- JCPennys) and the boots fit great. I got the boot wet with water sprinkles (few) while grocery shopping in the produce area of lettuce (just watered). I came home and took a little more water to the area and turned on the blow dryer on high. I gently swiped the blow dryer left and right and took my other hand over the suede. It dried within seconds and left no marking. I LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!!!!!!!!", "I've had mine for about a month and I love them! I am a size 6 1/2 and I bought a size 6, they fit me perfectly! The only thing I would take issue with is that I feel like the leather in the toe area is a little on the thin side, it gives me the feeling that they wont last very long with a lot of wear and tear. I got the sand color, I think next time I will get a darker color because this color stains easily. It looks good with most clothing colors though! Worth the money, I got them on sale too.", "Before buying these I tried a pair of Ugg Classics, they really weren't that comfortable. These, however, very soft and warm. I also like that the calf area isn't too snug, plenty of room for pants to be tucked in. I wear a 7.5 and ordered an 8, fits perfectly. A 7 would've been way too small for me. I started to get a tiny bit of dye transferring to my toes, not a lot. Had a pair of black Aussie Dogs that left my feet black after wearing them, so this really isn't so bad. I have a pair of Hi's and Lo's, both are great and worth having.", "This is my third pair of Emu Stinger Hi Boots, and I really love them.

Unfortunatelly, I can't use them at streets, as I am man and these shoes are made for women. Buy them!!", "I'd been looking at UGG, Koolaburra, Bearclaw and Emu. My finances have been tight, but when my gold box deal was $49.99 for this Emu, I took a chance. So happy. I wear 7.5-8. I ordered a 7 and it was a perfect fit. I have a high instep so I was cautious about the height of the shaft. No problem. Slipped on easily. I have a 13\" calf, no problem. Shipping was within a week and free. Really warm and soft.

They do NOT have a removable insole like my other pair and as described in the description. I guess it depends on who the pair you are getting comes from but, BEWARE.....some may be authentic and some may not. I'm returning my pair and just ordered a guaranteed authentic pair off of EMU's website directly.", "Good quality product. Only had it for one winter and the stitching has held up well. The suede is also fairly clean, a bit of water spotting from gardening in these boots (probably not a good idea). As for size, my foot is just on 9\" long, or 230mm and size 5 (womens) was snug at first but now after a few months, it is loose after the fleece has flattened down. I think a 4.5 would be perfect but I don't think I'll need to replace these boots for awhile. Sometimes my feet get a little sweaty in these boots so I pop on some socks and then it's fine. I love this colour too.", "I got these as a gold box deal because the price was great and my feet freeze every winter at work. I bought a size 7 and typically wear a 7 or 7 1/2. The fit is good except for the heel. The heel cup digs into the back of my ankle painfully when I'm walking around. As I typically sit at a desk all day, it's not a deal breaker considering they do keep my feet warm (which is a HUGE thing for me.) It would also be nice if they had so sort of finger gore at the top for those of us with calves that are a bit bigger, but that isn't a huge thing for me.", "Very warm and cozy boot that looks really nice. I normally wear size 9.5 but went down to 9 after reading the reviews and the boot fit nice and snug. I do get a bit of friction in the heel but I have a narrow foot and this is a problem I have with most shoes. Unfortunately I was not aware that these boots are not weather proofed and so I ruined mine by wearing them in a light rain shower! I tried to clean them with a suede cleaner but they still have a water mark. :( Hopefully this will fade with time. They are still comfy though and I have treated them to prevent further unsightly water stains!", "These are very comfortable right out the box. I only gave it 4 stars because of the sizing, which isn't really the boots' fault. I wear a 9 and I ordered an 8 after reading all the reviews that said they run big and to order a size down. Although the boots are not uncomfortable, my toe touchs the end. The boot is soft so, there is no pressure being put on my toes,but I would have been happier if I had ordered true to size and bought a 9. If I catch them on sale again, I will order another pair.", "Really nice boots. I ordered an 8 because they ran big, I thought it was too tight. I ordered a 9 and they fit but now they are a little sloppy. I still have the 8 so my daughter will get the 9's. I was actually going to send the 8's back to Ruze shoes and have them send me a 9, but the person there said just send them back and we will refund and go order on Amazon they are $20.00 less right now, Nice.. so I did, but ended up keeping both. Cool !!! the boots are really nice, warm and look good. I'm happy!", "they are warm and comfy and cute (and yes cute is all a matter of opinion). The sizing is true to size and does NOT run large (except maybe if you are a half size). There is arch support - yes it is not like you find in running shoes but it is more than you find in dress shoes (like heels, ballet flats, etc.) so I don't know why people are complaining about no support. And the insole does comes out so change it and put in more support if you need it. I have plantar fascia issues and have no trouble wearing these.", "The boots were fine, but ordered a women's 9 for someone that wears an 8.5 shoe and they were to small. Other than that they were fine. One other thing to think about is the Emu's are really pushed as being the true Australian Uggs, and Just like the Deckers they too are made in China but they don't make that very clear. I don't care too much about that, but if you say it it made one place it should be made there. With that being said, will reorder in the slightly larger size.", "I have had my EMU's for about two years now. I like to review products I have used for a while to ensure I give an accurate review. I had no issues with sizes. My boots did squeak loudly until I read a review that said they had removal sole inserts. The squeaking was the ONLY issue I had with the boots. I just took out the removable sole and quiet as a mouse.", "Just got it and wore for about a week. I normally wear size 6 1/2 or 7, but i ended up decide to order size 6. It's was tight when i first put on. It might feel uncomfortable @ first, but fits good after i wore for few hours....... Really good boots and love it so much.

Planning to get the low one~~~", "Initially, I read hundreds of reviews and was very skeptical on buying EMU boots.I finally caved in and got a pair for myself to see whether it was really different from my Uggs...and NO ONE can tell. All my coworkers and friends complimented me on my \"cute Uggs.\" They are very comfortable and soft. It also makes a big difference when I don't wear any socks. When I read other comments, some people advise you to not wear socks...and WOW what a difference. Also, I bought half a size smaller-which is perfect. It doesn't slide or feel like they will fall off. Cute and Affordable...you should try them!", "This is my second pair of EMU boots, my other pair are the shorter ones. These are warm, comfortable, well made, and great looking. They arrived in a timely fashion. They are definitely worth the price. Be sure to get the emu boot care kit so that they stay as nice and clean and water resistant. Pleased with my purchase.", "I bought these for my wife after hearing raves about the quality of Emu boots. Not only did my wife love these boots, but she wore them for most of the North Illinois winter.

I read the reviews on them stating that they ran large and to order a half size down. I normally wear a 9.5, so I ordered a 9. To my dismay, they were too small! I loved everything about them but the size! I had to return them, and they were no longer available, so I was disappointed twice!", "I thought I'd share a tip. I ordered Ugg water repellent spray from Zappos with free shipping. I can't really comment on the boots except to say that I bought my normal size, and they are fine. The weather hasn't been bad enough to wear the boots since I bought them, so I'll know more about them after next season.", "After reading previous reviews, I followed the advice and ordered the half size down (to size 8) and they fit great! It's true that they stretch a bit. They are super warm and I appreciate all the reviews because they helped in finalizing my selection for EMU Stingers. Great boot and they come highly recommended.", "My wife wears size 8 and these boots were size 8. One boot was larger than the other? She has never experienced this problem before with footwear. We were wondering if the incredible sale was to sell off their blemished products? Anyways within the first 2 hours of use the insole wool had flattened right down. She then pulled out her 1 yr old UGGS and the insoles were still soft and more comfortable. She likes the EMU boots but she says they're no true comparison to UGGS. She is not a bias person or an UGGS fanatic but the UGGS are more comfortable. Maybe thats why you pay more for UGGS perhaps.", "Very happy with this seller! Exchange went as prompt as can be with all the covid 19 cancellations 5 Stars. Excellent quality", "I don't really know how I'll like these boots, the first pair that I recieved had to be sent back, the left boot slumped, plus they fit like they were 2 sizes to big. This pair seems to be better, but time will tell. I must say that amazon has been great, they are really willing to help in every way that they can.", "I live in these boots. it is regularly under 20 degrees and my feet don't even know they are in the cold. I have poor circulation but my feet are toasty warm in these. When I get inside, they aren't hot, which is a major plus. The sheepskin really does regulate your feet amazingly well. I would love them in every color!", "Love these boots!!! I prefer Emu Australia over Uggs. I have tried them on together and Emu's are so much more comfortable. This is my second pair.

Not. While people rave about how comfortable they are, my girl was quick to point out that they offer no support. They are basically flat-bottom boot-sized slippers. If that's what you are expecting, then these are really nice boots for the money. Super soft and cuddly. Just no support, so really not a walking boot. Maybe I missed the point of these, but my girl gave me a quick \"Thanks, but you need to return these.\"", "I bought a 36 from a different Amazon affiliated company and thought it was snug and order this 37. But I wore the 36s in the house and they quickly stretched and fit well so when the 37s arrived I sent them back. I do love the 36 EMU boots I bought! I wanted the black ones and got a different color, and I would recommend these boots to everyone!", "I have purchased these boats before and for some reason this pair feels very tight. I was expecting for it to be as roomy as my other pairs which are the same size but in another color.", "Liked the little belt which is fashionable. The color has a bit of a red tone. My EMU's are true to color..Otherwise I'm happy", "I got these boots for $50 on a black box deal and for that price they are wonderful. I have narrow heels and they do slip on my heels if I wear them barefoot but if I wear a short sock they are just fine. I did try on Uggs when I realized that these slipped a little on my heel but they weren't worth an extra $100+ dollars. I like these so much for the price that I'm going to order my 8 year old DD a pink pair in her size.", "UPS just dropped these beauties off at my door. I bought my first pair of shearling lined boots way back in the 60s and have had quite a number of pairs over the years, but when I opened the box and saw these I was pleasantly astounded.. The lining is full and gorgeous. The sheep skin outside is earthy and natural, without being course and unrefined. The workmanship, stitching and lasting are all excellent. I put them on and they fit. They are the dream made real, better than I have ever seen before: a definite 5 star +.", "Boots are beautifully made. I wear a 10 woman.

I would have loved to get the deep rich chocolate color.", "I ordered a size 7 in these boots because I have UGGS that are size 7 and thought they would fit the same, not the case. I had to return and get a 7 1/2. I actually feel like my UGGS keep my feet warmer.", "This boot looks great and feels great. For those who do not want to spend UGG money, this is the way to go.

Very nice quality, dense shearling, fine construction. The inner shearling sole is removable for future replacement if necessary.", "Bought these as a gift 2 years ago and they are still holding up great. They have a more solid heel so they won't collapse like other name brand boots.", "I ordered these and when they arrived they looked great. I waterproofed them before I wore them outside. I did not get them wet but I was out in the snow. The first day they ended up with a dark line around the sole. I tried to sponge out with a damp sponge and the dye bled up into the foot of the boot. As I tried to blot it out it just spread across the boot and looks horrible. The info online said they would handle getting wet (do not submerge). The suede got hard and look terrible. They are ruined.", "I was a little disappointed with the color, just not what I expected. I thought they would be more of a true black but they're more charcoal colored. Also they are pretty snug but I think they will stretch some.", "I always thought Uggs were code for \"ugly.\" I decided to purchase these since the goldbox deal seemed like such a bargain. I LOVE them! They are an incredibly comfortable, surprisingly attractive, and high-quality product. I was glad I read other reviews for sizing info. I am usually an 8 1/2 and went down to an 8, which fits perfectly. Anyone have advice on care and conditioning?", "Purchased boots for wife, after breaking her foot needs to have flat soled shoes. These boots appeared to be the perfect fit, however, searched all of Amazon and Emu website for details of how to care for boots. Have found nothing. Consequently, when boots get wet, they dry very dark and dingy. Have cleaned, let dry and applied waterproofing, to no avail. You would think a manufacturer that is wanting to compete with Uggs and the like would put out some information/product to clean their boots. Not happy with the lack of information on this product.", "Really love the sole technology on the EMU boot compared to UGG.

I thought nothing could beat them - until I purchased these EMU boots. The fit is fabulous and the quality identical to my UGGs - at a substantially lower price.", "These boots are warm and comfortable. I love them and would recommend them to any one. Make sure you get the care kit to treat them before wearing. I will say though do not listen to the individuals that say they run big. The stingers run small. I am a 7 1/2 and I ordered an 8 thinking it would be perfect. The 8 did not even fit. I had to return them and order a 9. The bronti's run small or right on but the stingers do not.", "These boots are very comfy but I do have issues with my socks wanting to fall down in them. They also do NOT run big. They run small. I wear an 8 to 8.5 but had to get the 9 because the 7 was tiny.", "These boots are wonderful! After reading most of the reviews I was more confused than ever as to what size I should order. There were many recommendations about going down a size. I decided to order our usual sizes- for my daughter and myself. I'm soooo glad I did. They fit perfectly and even if they do stretch a bit they'll be fine. My recommendation is to ORDER YOUR NORMAL SIZE.

I replaced my old Emu's due to the wear and tear that occurred from wearing them for over four years.", "These boots are so incredibly comfortable! I absolutely love them. I now have several pairs of EMU stinger and a pair of UGGs. EMUs are just as comfortable, if not more so!!! Love them!!", "I bought these for my wife and she is very happy with them. She's only had them a few days, but she's worn them a lot in that short time. She'd been wanting a pair of UGG's, but when Amazon put these on a one day deal, I decided to buy them instead of UGG's. I'm glad I did. She has the sand color and is very happy with them, though I guess we'll wait to see if they hold up. She's typically an 8-8.5 in size and I purchased her a size 8 and they work perfectly. A great product!", "They were a little small/tight at first, but after wearing them for awhile I broke them in. I love these pair of boots.", "Look great, but no support, I have to use inserts, and still can't wear them long, warm though.", "The bottom insert is ok. Last time I bought EMU I replaced the bottom insert with an UGGs brand insert for a softer comfier fit.", "Cute boots. Warm and cozy in the winter. I could wear these all day!!", "We ordered the wrong size, tried to exchange for another and the company did not have the proper size in stock and then charged a restocking fee because it was part of the return policy. Forced to eat $30.00 of the purchase price. Nice product though and initially at a very competitive price.", "They are super comfortable. Very cute boots. I normally wear a 7.5 or 8. I bought an 8.. It fits perfect. It fits better than my short Bronte style Emus. My shorter ones are too big in the 8.", "My daughter had a pair of Uggs that were stolen @ school. I didn't have another $150.00 to spend on another pair. After a lot of research I found these Emu's that had the same sheepskin not an alternative wool lining inside. She loves them and I have thought of buying a pair for myself. She got the chocolate color Stinger Hi Premium Sheepskin boot from Emu. Nice color, very luxurious, great replacement for the Ugg's @ a much lower cost. I would highly recommend them.", "Love! Doesnt have a removable insert, but so cozy and definitely authentic!", "This is my second pair. Warm, comfortable, and easy to wash. I always buy my normal size and that works great!", "These boots are amazingly warm and soft. I wish they came in half sizes because the size 9 I got seems a tad too big, but I think if I had gone with an 8, I might have felt like my toes were cramped. Also they look chunkier than I thought they would. I wish they were a bit more shaped like the Ugg Knightsbridge. Unfortunately those are out of my price range so these became the next best option.", "I'm an 8.5 and I ordered a half size down after reading reviews but they were way too small. I would recommend ordering up if you are a half size.", "Good quality boots with warm and fluffy sheep skin lining. My only complaint is that the soles are a bit rigid so the boots do not readily flex with your feet when walking.", "I ordered the Emu boots because of the arch support. I know Uggs have not support but I need it. I have serious issues with my feet and have to have arch support. These are perfect. They are so warm and have just the right amount of arch support for me.", "The pair of boots is made of inferior materials. holes appears after a few months and just disintegrated. Not recommended.", "I LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!!!!!!!! They are so comfortable,I am actually wearing them as I am typing this review cuddled up on the couch with my little butter bean next to me. They are warm and toasty which has really been nice with the artic cool weather we are experiencing in Texas. I would highly reccomend these boots to anyone. I got a great deal on them from amazon.com when they were 60% off", "I normally wear an 8.5, and per the reviews I ordered an 8. It's too small and I should have ordered a 9. The grey is also a lot lighter in person than what is shown in the pictures. I returned.", "I love these boots I have been trying to decide these or UGG well.... when they had them on Gold Box I couldn't resist! I am soo happy I purchased these I got them 1 hour ago and plan on keeping them on until bedtime So NICE!!", "Purchased these boots for my daughter and we both absolutely love them! The quality is outstanding, inside and out. We have purchased the Bronte boot in the past and I was glad we 'upgraded' to the Stinger this year...it is simply a much better boot. The Stingers are very comparable to UGGs. Could not be happier!", "Very pleased with the boots. They fit and look exactly as anticipated. Looking forward to breaking them in during a northeast trip.", "I bought a pair last November. They started out great, warm and comfy in bare feet. I do wear my boots hard and walk around in the snow, although do not wear daily. So sad that the soles are falling off the from the boot. Will not last until next season and I will soon toss. So got at good price but for overall value, you may want to rethink and spend more money.", "My daughter like her EMU boots. It's nice to have quality and a good price when selecting boots. Thank you very much.", "I just recieved my new emu boots today!! They are the best, most comfy boots I have ever owned!! I absolutly love them!! I have not taken them off since I got them!! I want to get another pair in a diff. color!! They only took two days to get here too!! :)", "I just love these EMU boots! They are so comfortable and cushiony when I walk around with them. I am normally size 7 1/2, but I got size 8 and it fits perfectly!", "And was disappointed because the design and color was what I was looking for. The price was great - better than any place else.", "I was very pleased with these boots! I did not know what to expect since they were not Uggs nor were they as expensive, but I have been totally pleased!! Will buy this brand again!", "Nice boots, but I had to return mine because of incorrect sizing instructions. The description states \"Sizes run large, half sizes should round down,\" so I ordered a 9 instead of my usual 9 1/2. They were WAY too small; a 10 probably would be perfect. Not sure if Amazon will exchange them for me, since I got them at a really low price originally...", "These boots are of high quality and have held up well, with no stains. The inside is warm and cozy. Great shade of gray.", "Living in cold country with much snow these boots get quite a work out. They are hands down, the best boots ever. The fit is good per size and they keep my feet warm even without socks. They even dry quickly. Don't hesitate to buy these boots!!", "Quality boots for an affordable price. Love them. They don't make my feet too hot when it's not too cold out. Quality construction and wonderful materials were used.I would recommend these to anyone looking for a warm snuggly pair of boots.", "Got these for daughter to replace previous pair worn out over four hard-worn Wisconsin winters. She much prefers these to Uggs.", "This was meant to be. I'd been shopping with my daughter at a mall and she saw these boots but they didn't have her size. So I had the bright idea to look on line and found this awesome deal. And they arrived in time for Christmas!", "They were a strange fit, felt like two left soles.", "I was excited to get these boots and the fact I got them on sale was even better! But......the first time I wore them in the snow they got a dark water stain around the toes of both boots. I tried to clean them but to no avail. Disappointed. They are, however, the warmest shoes/boots I have ever worn.", "This boot is good quality and very warm. The problem I had was sizing. The calf was very wide...to the point that it looked silly on me and I returned it. Even though the foot size was OK, I still slipped around in the heel. Too bad that it didn't fit because it's nice and toasty.", "I just got these boots 2 days back and am in love with them. I was actually looking for a specific style of UGG boots but saw this on amazon for a steal price of $50 last week and ordered them off. They are a must have for the winter, very warm and very very comfortable. Compared to the bronte I believe this has a much sleeker finish. I ordered the chestnut color and it has a very nice rich look. Like the other reviewers mentioned you are bteer off ordering 1 size down as the boot stretches to fit well.", "Very well made boots happy with the quality would buy more of these boots for gifts, great product very affordable", "I bought these for my wife and she loves them. Saw them in a shoe store and they were really $139.00", "Great product. Three EMU products in the family. This one is great. Just be careful not to oversize.", "ABSOLUTELY comfortable and the chocolate is just beautiful! I've worn them to work and received many compliments on these EMU's. I have two other pair of UGGs, but the quality of the Stinger is superb! (Plus, they're cheaper than UGGs)...", "Love these boots. So comfortable and warm. Look great and more attractive than uggs!!", "I love these boots and got them on the deal of the day. They are a size too big and amazon will NOT exchange them for a size smaller. They said I would have to reorder them at the current price :( I did not think that was fair, especially since I was willing to pay the new shipping both ways. Now I have a pair of wonderful boots for someone else :(", "Great boot. I definitely recommend going with the higher quality EMU if you plan on wearing them a lot - the inner lining is much softer. If they holdup for at least year or two then I'd rank them equal to or even better than my UGGs.", "Great boot - sizing was perfect. Wear a 9 1/2 and ordered a 9. Just right. Amazon ordering and shipping was on time. Couldn't have asked for better service.", "I couldn't be happier. They are true to size, super comfy and really warm. They took one day to break in, and I wear them all the time now!", "I love these boots! They're super warm and comfortable to walk in. They fit true to size. Awesome purchase, highly recommend.", "I can barely get them on and my toes are pushing on the front. I love the color just wish I could wear them.", "I was looking online for prices on uggs & emus when I saw the special one day price of 49.99 for the emu high stinger. I couldn't hardly believe the price & bought them. They came today, they're great, in the emu box - insoles come out, the real thing. I love them! What a great purchase & a great price - plus the free shipping.", "i bought the emu stinger high in a size 8. i read all the reviews and i have other pairs of emus all in size 8.sadly i am returning them.they are too small.i would try a size 9 but they are more expensive. ty lynne", "These boots were awesome. I love them. I was super excited when i got them. They are really fuzzy n warm. The quality is very durable.", "I purchased these boots just a few days ago for my 17 year old daughter. I ordered the brown, even though the black was priced lower. The very next day, all the colors were priced at least $10 lower, and I was so surprised. I think I should receive a refund since I bought these in good faith. I am a good customer and should have received the same respect as other buyers.", "These are definitely not authentic EMU's! They are HUGE and made my feet look like big foot!! Returned for full refund.", "okay product, if i know that it will be like this... i will rather pay a little bit extra to go with UGG instead", "I had bought. Sand size 7, for the first time. It was a very soft fleece inside the. Was very happy for my foot. So I had to buy charcoal and chocolate to add. They were very disappointing. Doubtful whether the wool is right. All gone soft.

I won't recommend for extreme hiking", "So far I am happy with these shoes on an 8 mile trail run. Comfortable and no hot spots. I chose NB since they are few shoes that have wide trail running shoe and wanted more than a 4mm heel to toe drop. I usually wear 7.5 in most running shoes and decided to go with a 7.5 wide. It's possible I could have gone with 7 wide but didn't want to take a chance. The true test is longer run 10+ which I will try soon and post updates.", "I have had surgery on one foot and back surgery that affects the other. My New Balance shoes have been able to give me relief that no other shoe can. Of course they are great for exercising to. They are also made in America!!!! Fantastic price from Amazon as usual. What else could be better!!!", "I am a longtime wearer of New Balance Trail Running shoes and this is my second pair from the 610 series. I have had a similar experience as another reader with the heel which is much too large. I never have problems with the heels of my shoes but this particular pair is much too wide and loose. I have had to come up with a clever way to tie them and will ultimately be adding some heel padding to provide a better grip. The overall construction is high quality, I just don't know where they went wrong with the heel?!", "I wore these out of the box on a spring break trip to 4 of southern Utah's national parks. We hiked 6-10 miles a day on different terrain and these shoes were very comfortable and provide enough protection on uneven rocks and trails that I never had issues with foot pain. They breath well and grip nicely across the slick rock faces while ascending and descending on hikes. Highly recommend.", "After only a few days, the fabric on the tow ripped a hole. Fits very nicely, but is cheaply made. UPDATE - the (admitedly very small) hole that ripped within the first few days hasn't grown, despite tons of use, which is surprising. It doesn't affect the shoe at all, so doesn't bother me. The shoe fits my orthotics with no problem, letting me still feel like I can move my toes freely. The sole is a bit slippery on a gym floor, but perfect for outside running, and hasn't worn down at all since I've had it. I plan to take these with me on a big hiking excursion to see how they do.", "I wear a women's size 10 shoe (and have for years) but my feet swim in these. I returned them and ordered a size 9.5. They fit nicely through the mid-section but, again, were too large and floppy at the front of the shoe. I'd be happy to try a size 9 but they cost $20 more through Amazon and I'm not interested in paying more, especially since the same shoes can be found on Shoe Station (the company that supplied the size 10s) for $39.98 plus shipping. I'm very disappointed and should note that I've been wearing New Balance running shoes for the last 6 or 7 years.", "4.5 My favorite color is purple; that's why I chose this pair. It's more like a pink. They are a perfect fit and very comfortable, though. I will go for a run and let you know how they do. They are made in the USA, by the way (in Boston!).", "They are great wide shoes Women 8 C/D, surprising they run big. I'm not in love the way NB has been making the shoe around ankle area so short vertically. My shoe can definitely slip off easy which I don't like when shoes don't feel secure. This particular pair doesn't have amazing arch support. I imagine if you needed less support in shoes these would work. I have plantar fasciitis and my feet hurt after wearing these all day. The color comes off as hot orangey pink. Admittedly these shoes are probably perfect for people that don't have foot problems.", "Very nice and very comfy! True to size and width. I never used to have an issue with new balance wide width sneakers, I have been buying them for years. But lately it's been extremely difficult to find a sneaker that you put on and it just fits. Well these were comfy right out of the box. I only gave 4 stars because they aren't very feminine looking. With that said I bought them for work and I'm on my feet all day, so comfort trumps style!", "I ordered my usual size 6.5 and was a little surprised when they seemed a bit big when I first put them on. Then I looped the shoestring through the upper holes and they fit perfectly. Wore them all day on the day they arrived and found them to be very comfortable as they provided good support to my lower back and my knees. Also, they are light weight. Also, I was glad that the actual color combination (the blue) was a bit more subdued in real life than on my computer screen, though still bright enough to look cool in the warm months ahead.", "I bought these a few years ago to go trail running and they have been my companions ever since!! After years of wear the top pinky part started to rip though from downhill running. These lasted me 2 years and I loved every second of wearing them. Great for running on the street or hiking. I was going to buy a new pair for Xmas but saw that they discontinued this style in the wide option. Had to find a new style from New Balance - but I still miss these!!", "There is a bump in the heel of this shoe that is very uncomfortable and makes it slip up and down on your heel. Also the pair i received the rubber on the front of the toe on one was cut jagged. I love new balance shoes and it's all i buy, that said, this style was not like any of the others i ever purchased. I returned them and will reorder a different style.", "I've been wearing New Balance Trail Running shoes 610 & 410 size 9M for years and these were a little big for me in 9M. The packaging said these were \"assembled in the USA,\" and I've found that between factories a manufacture's size standards seem to get a little \"lost in translation\" so that's probably what's going on here. I really wanted to like these, but since I have narrow beyond belief heels, a \"little large\" is much too large for a running shoe.", "This is the third pair of this shoe I have had. Very comfortable, I never get sore feet from them on heavy-walking days, and they wear well. My favorite shoe. I have even gotten several complements from others who say they love (the looks) of this shoe.", "I use this for a varied exercise program. It has great traction and support. I like how the strip along the bottom is not the standard white so it looks good for a longer period of time. The shoe wears well.", "I bought these shoes in preparation for the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage walk in June. I chose the New Balance shoes because the pair of New Balance shoes which I wear for every day are very comfortable. The trail shoes have a memory sole which absorbs the impact of distance walking. The sizing is true and feels comfortable even with hiking socks. I am quite pleased with both pairs of New Balance shoes and feel prepared for walking 10 -14 miles each day.", "Great trail running shoes! They definitely run a little big. I usually order a 9.5 or a 10, Amazon was recommending I order an 8.5 (what!?), and to be safe I went with a 9. These have held up better than some of the other shoes I've had lately. I'm not sure if it's because they're made better or because I'm slacking on my running.", "I have the hardest time finding comfortable shoes. I have wide feet and have worn Birkenstocks for years. I found these shoes first at a shoe store , and they fit like a glove. I then twisted my foot and this shoe gave my foot the support I needed to walk. It was love. I am a nurse and am on my feet for at least 12 hours a night. I was able to work with my injured foot because of these shoes. I wear them all the time now. I bought a spare pair here, just because when it's love, it's love.", "Look good, runs maybe a hair wide, but overall of the three shoes (Adidas, Reebok and this) this was the keeper. The Reebok looked better was just a bit narrow, The Adidas did not feel great on my ankle, so far I'm enjoying this shoe. I'm 5'8.5\" weigh 150 pounds. I do very light workouts, walking, and standing in this shoe. I wear an 8 or 8.5 depending on brand and sock style.", "these look good in the picture, but upon receiving the materials are cheap and thin on the tongue causing the laces to bite into the top of the foot. Heel drop feels lower than the toes. The seams where arch support overlap causing a bump to push into the arch. RETURNED to amazon without issue.", "I was surprized with this shoes. It looks well made, comfortable, light and springy. It is close to the zero drop but I like that bust of energy it gives me. The shoes run big and somewhat narrow, I am typically 9.5-10, I ordered this in 9.5 and they are 0.5 size big but I like it this way. The heel is a bit roomy also, and I like it snug. I haven't run in them yet, so I will update the review.", "very uncomfortable. Hard to get on and once on foot slides around. Back sits up to high on ankle.", "I wear 8-1/2 M and this pair fits true to size with a tiny wiggle room if wearing thin socks, otherwise it's perfect with thick sports socks. No need to order half size up or down. Good arch support and cushiony - much better for walking than running shoes. I would wear it around town because it's stylish, light weight, and very cool colors. The purple color is grayish light purple - a very sweet and versatile color and right in my alley. It's a bargain for $45 and my $80 black Asics mom's walking shoes will be banished to car trunk for emergency purpose.", "I love these shoes; they are adorable and SO comfortable. I would rate them five stars, except they look a little strange when looking down, on the inside of my feet. I feel like my feet look like ovals rather than feet. I get that it's a very superficial reason to deduct a star, but it kept me from being head-over-heels in love with these shoes.", "Tried many shoes for \"hiking\" my local nature trails. These fit nicely, don't have any spots that rub on my feet, heel, or toes. They work for me. I may order a second pair. I do not run in them, but walk at least 4 miles a day in them. Update: I DID order a second pair.", "I bought these for a vacation I will be taking next month. I have actually worn them for about 3 hours and they are very comfortable. The fit my foot perfect and my feet did not sweat. The only reason for four stars is that I do not know how they be after wearing them for 8-12 hours at a time.", "When I read a review saying size up a full size, I do. These shoes were \"flapping\" through the toe. (They were the same size as a pair of New Balance I was replacing. I sent them back for a size smaller...We'll see!", "Feels like a slipper, no arch support. They are comfy tho and made wide feet are happy. However, I ordered 9.5 wide and usually I am bigger 9, they are too big for me. I'll have to return them. Not sure if I'll want the same style, like I said, comfy but no real structural support.", "Did add inserts for more arch support as my feet didn't like these even though I wear nothing but New Balance. Usually 7.5D or 8D and these 8D's have lots more room in the toe than I'm used to but that's actually been a good thing. Might try going with 7.5D if I buy more of these but overall, I am pleased. :) Tread on them is great for walking the trails!!", "I have had New Balance sneakers before and the fit of this shoe was what I expected it to be. They are comfortable and have good tread for the trails I walk on. I thought the price was reasonable. Very pleased with this purchase. I would recommend to a friend and might buy another pair for myself while my size is still in stock.", "Very comfortable shoe. I stand on my feet all day and I have had no problems with this shoe. They are sharp looking. I have had many compliments on the shoes.", "I have a pair of these New Balance WT610V5 Trail Shoes and my daughter fell in love with them. So, I ordered this pair for her. She loves them and we both would recommend them.", "These 10.5 New Balance sneakers were actually LARGER than a pair of New Balance sneakers size 11 that I brought home from a brick and mortar store. They are probably a good fit for someone with an average width foot; but for me, they were much too large in the toe box.", "Well, I like the price and mosaic pattern. The size is a bit large so I have to get shoelace tighter. But I understand different brand has different scales of sizes so I won't comment too much regards. Next time I will buy two sizes and try. Maybe merchandise can put up a more precise chart in the future.", "Nice shoes. Has decent arch support for right off the shelf. I bought these for a 3 week trip I took to Europe. Only complaint I have about them is after a few days it feels like the insert had slipped to the inside on both the shoes. I tried fixing it multiple times, but it always went back. Not enough for me to stop wearing them, just enough that it was noticeable.", "Too big! Do not order 1/2 size up, had to return, but very nice shoes", "I usually wear a size 10 because I wear insoles in all my shoes. These were much too big. I had owned a pair of new balance trail shoes that were size 9 1/2 and they were too small. It probably depends on the model of shoes", "I am hoping I can get used to these shoes. I have worn the New Balance 610V2 and loved them, but the fit on this newer version is completely different. I have wider feet, but usually can fit into a B. This is what I ordered this time, but these shoes are very wide, so much so that they are almost sloppy on my feet. The cushioning is good. I am thinking that if I cannot wear them for running, maybe I can wear them for walking as long as I wear a thicker sock.", "Just received these New Balance trail shoes this week. Have only had them on once but they are very comfortable, Fit very well. I believe my expectations are met. I wear New Balance shoes 85 percent of the time when I'm jogging or power walking. Will update my review in a few more weeks. I do recommend this shoe.", "Love New Balance shoes and particularly these. New Balance shoes give me great foot support and are very comfortable. I bought this pair because I was going on a walk where the ground was uneven and rough and and this shoe let me walk in comfort with good support.", "Im on my feet10+ hours a day and need something comfy yet durable. New Balance trail runners are the best. Ive had a previous version of this shoe and i tried many other brands before i came back for another pair of these.", "Very light and comfortable. Perfect for rugged trails only. I tried using this shoe walking on flat street payment and it wasn't made for that. But great for trails and dirt.", "Wonderful shoes! I have bad feet....to say the least. These kicks allow me to jog on the treadmill and are great for my outdoor excursions. Highly recommend.", "I always purchase New Balance shoes. They are the only brand of shoes I wear. That being said, these are the worst NB shoes I have ever worn. The quality is super cheap, and the support is not at the usual NB standards. My feet actually hurt after I have worn these shoes for a few hours, causing me to switch back to my old pair. I wish I would not have wasted my money!", "The shoe is fairly comfortable but runs large. I\u2019ve worn a size 9 medium in new balance for years and needed an 8.5 in this one. I read somewhere that the shoes made in the USA for Reebok use the original sizing pattern but those made outside the US use different patterns.", "The price is super affordable for these great quality shoes! In June 2015, I tore the ligaments in my ankle and fractured my fibula on a hike (I didn't own trail shoes) while wearing Nikes. That was a HUGE wake-up call to how important quality trail shoes are!!! I wear these every single day because of the support. I have wide feet, and these fit PERFECTLY!", "I just finished Tough Mudder full marathon (10 miles) with these shoes and they work great; no scrapes or complaints. This shoe is a cheaper alternative to Solomon's and work just as great.", "This shoe has a nice wide tow box which I need for my problem bunion. I added an arch support for my high arches as well. I purchased 9 1/2 Wide and my foot measures 9W. I just like the extra room. I could probably wear them without an arch support but my ankles prone inward somewhat. Color as pictures. Nice to go with jeans. I walk a lot.", "I love the fit of these shoes! They are light, but stable. The tongue and soles are a coral pink, but the laces and the underlayer of the shoe appear red as they blend with the black.", "Most comfortable sneakers. They are light and are great for walking and working out", "These are very comfortable and have great grip. I wear them primary for hiking and i feel sturdy in them even when I have my 2 year old on my back. I have narrow feet and these fit perfectly - I usually have a hard time finding a shoe that isn't way wide. These are perfect.", "I bought these for my mom. I was hoping they'd offer a little more stability with more traction. She has yet to try the shoes out on any rough terrain. But she loves the way they fit and is excited to try them once the snow clears.", "These shoes feel clumsy. They run big, and are already heavy. Feels like I'm throwing my hips out when I wear them. The quality and colors are nice, they just felt too clumsy.", "Nice shoes, fit in my normal size. Good cushioning, look a little long on the foot and the laces are really long if you don't use the upper side eyes.", "These went on sale so I got them immediately the only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because the picture is a little bit misleading I thought they were red and black instead of hot pink and black.", "Great color with gray orange and deep purple. They fit well but my left shoe fits slightly bigger. But it's only because my left foot is smaller my right foot! I took a 6 mile hike the first time wearing and no blisters. No breaking in required!", "Great walking sneakers - comfortable, provide great support and grip. I have no arches at all and any time spent on my feet usually leaves me with aching feet and knees unless the shoes are as good as these. Love the purple/gray color. Very good shoe at a great price.", "These shoes in the purple and yellow are very attractive and not too bright. I got a great buy. There is ample room in the toe bed which is important to me. They are very comfortable compared to some of my other New Balance sneakers.", "Love these shoes. The last pair lasted us a year wearing them at least 5 times a week. Will buy again.", "Just as described. About a 1/2 size bigger than I needed, but that\u2019s the price when ordering without trying them on.", "Although extremely lightweight, they come ip high on the top of my foot. They are slightly narrower than usual for a D width. They are comfortable with the top lace undone and my orthodics fit in great.", "I love NB and that's all I wear. That being said, I also always wear the same size. These were about 1/2 to a full size too big. Perhaps they were mislabeled?? I tried to reorder a smaller size, but they're not available. Oh well.", "I have not had a pair of NB that I never really disliked. I love the trail shoe for east to moderate hikes.", "These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned, my 5th pair but the first I have ordered online! Thanks for the convenience of online ordering!", "Fits as I expected, but people new to New Balance should know that the trail shoes run a bit wider than the running shoes - so this pair is slightly large for me. Still, they're great, sturdy shoes.", "Comfortable right out of the box, no break in necessary. Walked about 3 miles yesterday and over 5 today with no problems at all. Nice roomy toe box.", "Very comfy trail runners with decent grip. My only disappointment is that the arch is not quite as high as the older version (which I literally wore into the ground). The fit was right the first time as New Balance is fairly reliable even across styles.", "I wear sneakers all day at work, but needed something that would be less \"bright and colorful\" and these fit the bill. They fit well and after 8-9 hours in them my feel still feel great.", "I only buy New Balance in sneakers so sizing wasn't an issue for me. The color was a bit more than what I usually go for, but they're gorgeous! Love them!", "I wear an 8 always but because of the reviews I bought a 7.5. They fit a tad snug in the toe, but I've done several 5 to 8 mile hikes in these shoes and they fairly comfortable.", "Fit is larger/wider than other New Balance shoes I've bought. The grip is also horrible for a trail running shoe; other New Balance trail running shoes I've bought were much better, this was pretty disappointing.", "My wife said they fit OK and comfortable but not as comfortable as the other pair she got in a different color. She is going to use these for training and save the other pair for the upcoming race.", "Pros: Excellent support and coushoning. True to size. Traction and control is very good. Cons: Trad outsole begin to detached in the second use.", "My heel slips out if I don't tighten the shoestrings just right. the insole does not have softness and is why I bought them for. I ended up putting a Dr. Schols insert in.", "I am giving it four stars because just after a few weeks, the stitching where the Newbalance logo is on each tongue, started to unstitch! Poor stitiching for the company logo.", "These were a little larger and not as comfortable as I expected. I was also looking for a sleeker shape and these didn't quite look right even though they are OK.", "Great fit and comfortable shoes got me through multiple days at Disney.", "My foot doctor recommended that I get new balance and I have several pairs, for some reason these particular sneakers come up a little too far on my ankles and they hurt because they rub.", "The fit is great. Just wish they had more foot padding. The memory foam doesn't last very long when walking or standing.", "I typically have issues with the heels of shoes slipping because my heels are narrow. This pair fits perfectly. And it's comfortable. Here's to no blisters on the trails this summer!", "They fit well and are comfortable. I have a lot of trouble with athletic shoes leaving blisters on my heels, but not with these. I hope these will last me awhile because I really like them.", "Bought these to replace my Sketchers when I noticed that I have a habit of walking on the arches of my feet.

Highly recommend.", "if you have wide feet order extra wide, not normal fit for new balance, a little too tight", "Love these shoes! I have a pair in each color", "Great trail running in these. I normally buy an 8 in sneakers and returned for a 7.5. Still were a little big but comfy!", "Very nice shoes. I felt so lucky to find such nice shoes so inexpensively.

I have plantar fasciitis so I have to use an insole but the traction is great.", "My right foot is larger slightly than my left, it has arthritis and I had surgery to remove arthritic bunion on both sides of the foot last fall. I walk a lot of different trails with my dog and needless to say, my right foot can be a problem! This shoe is very comfortable, so far so good on the trail! Roomy and cushioned, nice purple gray color, love these shoes!", "Couldn't believe that they fit....have such a hard time in stores finding the right New Balance & was very scared of buying online...size 6 is never the same in all shoes.... have gotten several comments on my shoes & where did you buy them", "This is the most comfortable tennis shoe I have ever owned. I am on my 2nd pair!", "The color of the shoe is really pretty but mostly the comfortable fit is what I really love.", "Have purchased these in the past from big box store. Same great quality. Same comfort. Will order again when needed.", "Really liking these shoes. The tread is fantastic. It's been incredibly icy and I haven't slipped a single time with these shoes. They feel a little shallow when you put them on, but I haven't had my heels slip out at all. Happy with my purchase.", "Fit is exactly as expected in my size 10 shoes. Great grip. Nice looks. A greay and coral shoe.", "I bought this for my older sister who has small feet. She really LOVED them and they fit perfectly.

There is plenty of room for my orthotics also (I got the wide width for that reason).", "Love this style for going walking on the trails. They fit to perfection and are light but durable. Second pair in over 5 years. Love them and I would not buy any other brand.", "ordered reg shoe size but were 1 whole size too long and i think the c part of the c/d width at the arch side left a lot of space. I just want the d width.", "I ordered a half size larger as I normally do for walking shoes, but the were too short. I returned them.", "Comfortable shoe. With another brand trail shoe I wear a 9 half W. Had to return little too long and reordered the 9 W and fits better.", "I usually wear a 8.5 in New Balance, but the site recommended an 8. I ordered both and the size 8 was in fact correct. I have had other pairs of 610's and they have lasted a long time. The toe of the new ones is more cloth and I suspect that my big toe will break through more quickly than the older model where there was more rubber covering the toe area.", "7 way too big got 6.5 fit perfectly comfortable shoe", "I luv these shoes, so cute on, I wear them for biking on the trails alot!", "would have liked them better without the neon yellow on the back.", "The most comfortable pair of athletic shoes I ever owned. So comfortable I just bought a second pair.", "These are my first pair of New Balance shoes and I love them! The arch support is nice, the toe box is just roomy enough.

I have to buy another pair but not these.", "I love these shoes, except I hadn't owned them very long and the sewing on the toe started to come undone. Should have called New Balance but too late now. Can be slick on certain surfaces.", "Love these shoes. They are of high quality and fit great.", "The left shoe was lacking perforations for the shoestrings up near the ankle. It also fits a bit looser than the right.

I have been buying New Balance Trail shoes for a while now.", "Fits great with my AFO. I had to purchase a size 12 wide, instead of my normal size 11.", "I ordered these in an 11D and they fit great right out of the box. I got trail runners specifically for my day-to-day wear because the toe box on my other sneakers was too narrow and other reviews said these had a wider toe box. They have great spring and were comfortable and perfect without needing to be broken in.", "Very impress on how they fit and how light they are for tennis shoe", "I bought my 3rd pair of new balance shoes an I love them", "Not alot of inner support but add an insole and they are very nice!", "These shoes were huge! I'm sure they were men's. My size 9 B was over an inch longer and wider than my existing four pair of New Balance shoes. Too bad. I liked the design and color. I did leave a comment about these being men's shoes, but never heard back from the supplier.", "These seem to fit larger in the width than normal.

Fabric is very breathable and cool for summer walking!", "Shoes seem comfortable, but they are about a size or more too large", "Wife loves them for jogging...she claims comfort level is better than brand. Also noted the actual color is better (more vibrant) than pictures shows.", "Most comfy shoes at the moment. May order again when I beat these up! =)", "Having read prior reviews that noted this shoe as small and advised to \"order a size up,\" I ordered a 5 1/2, which is my usual. I couldn't keep them on. I returned them for the 5, which fit perfectly--and not at all tight or small. In fact, after one wearing, I had to tighten the laces. They are very comfortable, stylish, and fun!", "Even though they are a little wider then the exact same pair I already have, just different color, they are still super comfortable and I highly recommend them.", "These are running shoes but I am wearing them for work.

I have plantar fasciitis and slipped my orthotic into these shoes and took off! Feel like I have more energy to walk further. Great shoes at an economical price. Very happy with them.", "I walk 5 miles a day six days per week and I had been wearing a more expensive different name brand sneaker. I decided to try New Balance for a change. What a difference! It was like walking on a cloud they felt as if they were made just for me. I will definitely be ordering another pair.", "You can replace the inserts with your own for better support.", "These shoes are fine but they run a bit too large.", "I have a terrible bunion on my left foot and I run/power walk a mountain 4 days a week.

Length is exact.", "I have been a fan of NB for long time. They come through again with the WT610v5. Great shoe!", "New Balance never lets me down.

There is arch support but if you are having issues with your feet then you make want a custom insert made for you your foot.", "I bought these shoes for a technical 50k trail race. They are incredibly lightweight for a trail shoe and very comfortable. I am a 9 so I bought a 9 with these shoes and feel like they are just slightly too big. I don't think an 8.5 would be better though (probably too small) so I plan on wearing good socks that are on the thicker side to address this size perception. Great color, and very comfortable. Can't go wrong for the price!", "New Balance perfect fit for my feet...I buy several of a style that has minimum seams in the toe area.", "R shoe is very comfortable, but L shoe arch support is too high and hurting my arch.

I'm a 6.5 or a 7 and I got a 6.5 in this shoe and its on the big side. I kept it because it fits ok, but I feel like a half size smaller would've been perfect. This is strange to me cause I literally have not worn a size 6 in any shoes in over 10 years and considering my boyfriend had a similar issue with the men's it must be the brand or shoe itself.", "Wouldn't call them pink!

I'll probably purchase another pair.", "I like it, i often go out to play with my shoes.", "I bought these shoes in a C-D size. while the top is wide enough, the soles are way too narrow for the shoes and make them not wearable.

Great price too.", "As the title explains I have been a wearer of reebok zig style running shoes for awhile. Generally these shoes are well constructed however the eyelets are not reinforced like in previous models (maybe to save weight) but it does make the shoe feel cheaper. The insides and toe are reinforced though but my problem has always been on the outside developing a hole by my little toe. My biggest complaint though is even though I ordered the same size they run slightly larger an issue I could deal with in everyday shoes but for running this is going to be an issue and I might end up donating this pair", "I've walked a few miles in these shoes, comfortable out of the box, felt a little tight in the midstep , very light, really nice, comfortable shoe for hiking.

I NEED to get another pair!", "This will be my 5th pair of this style of zig-tech shoes, just slightly varied colors. I absolutely LOVE these shoes and wish they were more readily available. They're extremely comfortable, especially out of the box. The sole lasts for a good long time before it wears down, and the shoes are very durable. I work a job that involves a lot of restraining of people when they get out of control so they get stomped on all of the time and yet still hold up great. Lastly, they're very fairly priced. 10/10. I'm going to be really upset when these aren't available anymore.", "I bought these to wear for work because I'm on my feet for long periods of time. These shoes have helped quite a bit with the fatigue my feet were feeling with my previous pair of shoes. There's a memory foam insole which is nice and soft on the feet.

While this doesn't seem like a big deal, this Reebok shoe is narrower (must be what the .5 difference is) than my old ASICS running shoes and thus feels too small.

These shoes fits a little tighter compared to other brands but I'm been using Reebok forever so if you're new then buy half size larger.", "They are not really comfortable, if you are standing or walking for 6 to 7 hours a day this shoes will start killing your feet after like 2weeks", "Had an old pair of Zigs that are worn out.

They\u2019re cut narrow as I have narrow feet and I barely fit into the sides comfortably. I like the femininity of the pointy toe. However, the configuration of the cut-outs would make it very uncomfortable for anyone with wide feet or bunion issues because they start right at the junction where the foot bends, so it will dig into those areas. They fit true to size and the top band fits comfortably and is great for keeing the shoe from slipping off the heel.", "Beautiful and sexy. I'm between sizes (6 to 6.5) but always order up with closed toe shoes especially pointy toes, which are gorgeous. I love these, bought in a 6.5 shown here with bare feet. Incredibly comfortable for a middle height but not super high heel. The leather is a creamy neutral color with a super important non-slip bottom.", "The most comfortable high heels I\u2019ve ever worn! They fit true to size, the quality is excellent! I wear them for about eight hours at a time the end of the day my feet don\u2019t hurt! I ordered the nude pair also! Compliments are common every time I step out!", "Best dress shoe purchase ever! Normally I wear an 8 1/2, so that\u2019s what I ordered. That pair cut into my foot right above the toes (I have a very high arch and high instep). The 9 would be too sloppy, if this was a traditional pump. However, the strap across the instep keeps the shoe securely on my foot. The shoe doesn\u2019t slip , and I don\u2019t walk out of them. The heel is high, but comfortable. I\u2019m up and down all day\u2014often walking a block or two at a stretch\u2014I can finish my day without hobbling in pain. And, the style brings compliments all day, every day.", "The shoe itself is really nice, but unfortunately, they are extremely narrow so your feet come off the side of the shoe. All my shoes are medium, not wide, but unless your foot is extremely narrow, this won't really work. As far as size goes, they are true to size... no need to size up.", "These heels are extremely comfortable and are gorgeous. Just to let you know, I only wear heels 2-3 times a year. With this in mind, I was pleased and surprised to find that I was able to wear them for several hours. What makes them comfortable is that they have a comfortably padded insole. Weight distribution is equal, and not solely on the toe.", "Love these shoes. I usually wear a 7.5, but they were out of stock. I had read reviews that mentioned the shoes ran a bit big, so I got a 7. They fit perfectly. I wore them to a back tie event and I am wearing them today at work. They are dressy enough to go fancy or business, which I love. I was on my feel for 4 hours and they didn't hurt my feet at all. I love the strap across the top of my foot.", "Love these. Ordered them and a few other pairs in a Prime Wardrobe box. These are the most comfortable heels I\u2019ve ever owned. And they look fierce. Not just a plain old black heel.

I have never had issues with narrow shoes, my feet are narrow too... these shoes barely fit me; I figure that most people would have a problem with these shoes not fitting.", "Love these shoes. I\u2019m older so I can\u2019t wear really high heels anymore without being in pain. These are shaped so they don\u2019t hurt my ankles!

They fit really well too!!", "I am not typically one to spend a lot on shoes, and $88 is a lot for me. I had been experiencing discomfort with my inexpensive shoes from Kohls and thought to try a \u201cbetter\u201d brand. The shoe fit like a glove and was very comfortable. Imagine my disappointment when, after 5 short months of ownership and wearing just 6 times, the heel tip wore through to the metal.", "Received this very nicely wrapped and quality seems really good. Nice leather smell. Strap holding your foot in creates additional stability. The heel itself is set a little to close to the inside of the foot in my opinion, though I tend to walk on the outside of my foot. I also own this shoe in black and the nude colour seems to be a little roomier - slightly wider in the toe box and the strap allows for a higher instep. Might be a difference in the type of leather used.", "I have a wide toe box w/ narrow heel. As I figured after reading the reviews, a 7.5 would be too narrow. Usually go up 1/2 size with pointy toes to accommodate that but the heel on the 8 was way too big. I was hoping the strap would hold my foot in but it does not. Heel slipped and there was no way to walk in them. Shame, its a very pretty shoe with not a terribly high heel that would have been great for work.", "Wonderful! If you a little bunion you may want a shoe stretcher gadget. I have to use one of those sometimes for one of my feet. Otherwise, nice shoe and comfy. In some shoes I wear 7.5. I ordered a 7 for this shoe. It was a perfect fit and doesn\u2019t slide around. If you do not want to show toes but still need to be presentable, this is the shoe!", "These shoes are so cute, they're well made and beautiful.... but they SQUEAK! I tried multiple sizes and even a wide fit and the leather squeaks loudly when I walk. It is awful. I don't know if breaking them in would help, but I wasn't about to take the chance. I don't usually have this issue with shoes and own multiple pairs of CK. Very frustrating as these are really cute and the heel height is perfect for work.", "I'd been watching these pumps for about a year and when they went on sale ($70) I purchased them. Other reviewers said how comfortable they were and they are right. I stood/walked an entire day in them without difficulty. I am a standard size 9 and purchased same. I'm very happy with these shoes.", "I haven't been able to figure out how to get in touch with someone from Amazon but the soles fell off the second time i wore these. I took this photo a month ago which was a month after purchase. Saying that, i have 2 other pairs which are fine and i love the style but seems these soles were bad.", "Love the style of these shoes! I had to get a 1/2 size bigger than I usually wear. This specific color, Desert Sand are darker than they appear in the picture; more of dark taupe", "Great shoes, go with everything. True to size, true to color, non-slip soles. Classic Calvin Klein Pumps", "I love these shoes! They're a little loose in the heel because I have weird shaped feet, but the crossover part keeps them on my feet. No blisters for me normally, but I wore them with stockings once and the slipperiness of the stockings made my feet move more and I did get a blister. I plan to avoid that in the future with either thicker stockings or hopefully I can find some with grip so my feet don't slide.", "High heels are not my typical go to but I could not resist these #calvins I absolutely love them.

I've worn them a few times around the house to break them in, which there was no need to as they stayed comfortable. I love them and I'll keep checking for price drops to get them in another color....or two.", "I like the fact the it\u2019s comfortable and fit the toe box very good and the heels size is great what I dislike is the width is too wide so therefore it\u2019s loose wish I did just order a 10 instead a 10 wide I hope it doesn\u2019t stretch any further though because I really like this shoes", "Unfortunately, I bought patent leather but this feels like rubber. Beautiful Looking shoe, The price was good at $20, but that doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t use them. This patent leather is not the quality I expected, and I will be returning them.", "Love these shoes! They look amazing and can be dressed up for a gala or down with jeans. Gave them 4 stars as they weren't extremely comfortable several hours into the first wear, but I'm hoping once they are broken in, they will maintain being as comfortable as the first time you put them on.", "I purchased 3 different colors of the beautiful Calvin Klein shoes. The black only cost $60 but I never thought they would fall apart on me. My left shoe practically crumbled in my hand. I was so shocked. 3 mos. old? I have $20 shoes that last way longer than that!! I can't return them but I can worn others!!", "Love these. They are a very comfortable height, for the days you are not up to waking on stilts, but still want to look all dressed up. No breaking in period and the color us a true pastel with a little glitter. Lovely shoe.", "Such a cute shoe. It is very comfortable to walk in. I originally purchased a 9, and had to return it and get a 9 wide. My foot wouldn't even go in... yikes. The 9 wide I can wear all day at work in the showroom but it is a little tight across the top of the foot. I am hoping with the real leather that this will soften over time but overall i am very happy.", "I was waiting for this shoe to go on sale for an upcoming wedding and when they finally did, I snagged them. They look amazing and feel comfortable as well. The angle and height of the heel are super comfortable. I am considering getting in another color as well.", "The size chart was not mention size 5 or 5.5 so when I ordered 5.5 I found it big.

I get compliments every time I wear them.", "This high heels hurt my feet so bad! But I stood for a long time. Maybe if you don\u2019t have to walk a lot, you won\u2019t feel this much. To me, I bought two colors and I tried only black one and I couldn\u2019t have this on at work again.", "Not only are these shoes super cute on, they are shockingly comfortable! The heel isn\u2019t too high either, just the right height!", "If you have broad feet will not recommend as although i purchased wide width it is still a narrow top so very uncomfortable. However excellent quality and very classy looking", "Size 7, black, fit perfect! Love these shoes and have received many compliments! Very comfortable, can wear all day! Wear with dresses and jeans! My favorite heels!", "The most comfortable shoes. Leather is great the sole is non slip. Heel is perfect. From the first day they were amazing. I am trying to buy the cream in the same size but, not in stock. There is enough room for the toes even though the front has a point. The point is just right to give a amazing look with a dress, jeans or any outfit. Easy to put on as it has a little elastic stretch section on the side docent come off as you are walking.", "Lovely shoe but I got my first blister on the toe next to my baby toe on both feet.

I probably will check out other colors but Red is my Favorite\u2764\ufe0f", "I ordered these for a Christmas party and they were perfect. Made of high quality smooth leather. They fit my feet like a glove. And to top it off they are quite attractive. I received multiple compliments.", "These are gorgeous! The do run slightly large, but a size down would be too small. Just got little pads for the ball of my foot and that did the trick. High heel, but slightly cushioned instep.", "One of the best pair of shoes ever!!!! I can literally walk all day in these shoes. I have some problem foot areas, these shoes do not effect these sore spots. best purchase of all the shoes I have purchased this far!!", "In all honesty, I have not had a chance to wear these shoes because of Covid-19, but so looking forward to it.

Just what I expected. I ordered the regular and wide. The wide ended up being too loose. I kept the regular.", "Love them! The heel is just high enough for someone who does not wear heels often. They are comfortable and gorgeous. I really enjoy wearing these shoes. Will probably order in black when my size becomes available.", "These stay on my fee quite nicely, I hate it when pumps are loose and floppy. Style is great and they are comfortable for a day at the office. I would NOT wear them to the market or for a day of walking, but, I don't wear heels that much so this is great for me.", "The tow width was too small. The shoe front is not comfortable. With the high heel, the arch is awful. It hurts the back when you stand and walking with the heel . You need to have a comfortable sole and arch when you have heels like that. Shoe must not be that uncomfortable. I want to return it but I have worn it once. This is Calvin Klein!", "I love these shoes. They hug my feet. Great for dancing the night away. Another great Calvin Klein purchase and the color will go with just about color outfit.", "Great shoes, it\u2019s getting harder to wear heels all day for work as I get older but these were perfect for a full work day filled with multiple meetings and getting around town. I plan to order a second pair.", "These shoes were SO comfortable, it was shocking. I wanted to keep them so bad just because of that. However, I couldn't find a way to wear them. The style looked too conservative with dresses, and too radical with pant suits. I couldn't make it work with anything.", "These are great to dress up a jeans outfit or to wear with suits, dresses, and skirts, comfortable, sleek and sexy!", "I love the design of this show. Traditional pumps fall off my feet so I'm always looking for something different. Paul Green makes beautiful, comfortable and durable shoes. This isn't as comfortable as the others I own. It could use a litttke more padding but it's still good for work and looks great.", "I absolutely love the shoe and even bought two pairs in different colors. HOWEVER, after only 2 times wearing them, the cap came off of the bottom of each heel and metal is showing. I didn\u2019t wear them on gravel or rough terrain either. Just normal walking on sidewalks. Plus I\u2019m over my return period by a few days. I\u2019m sad.", "These are some of the most comfortable high heels I\u2019ve ever worn.

But overall it\u2019s been a few months and they work well for me.", "I got these because my other shoes were on their last legs and was thinking it would be cool to have a pair of trainers. That was until I got them, they fit but they can not handle water at all. I wore them to work and the moment they hit a slick surface they lost all traction with the floor. I was able to put my butt against a wooden door the weight of the door slid me from one side of the door frame all the way to the other. After a 4 or 5 hour shift my feet began to get just as sore in these shoes, as they do in my regular 30 dollar Walmart shoes.", "As others have said, these are not running shoes for a litany of reasons. The outsides of mine have been durable, but the \"softfoam Sockliner\" by the heel has a hole from the shoes not being super tight and my socks brushing against it. Worse, the insole is almost completely flattend, and no longer spongy/ soft. These shoes are worth 29.99, for that price, they would get three stars.", "Bought the 11 1/2US. I use these shoes for work, shoe is actually microfiber, and gets dirty pretty quickly. Wish I had known that before buy. It's just very hard to find pumas in my size and that the style, color, and size are available. Loved how they look, and arrived very quickly. Fit was a little bigger around the top, and as for wide, that was perfect. I'm flat footed, so pumas being shoes I love wearing but being snug on the sides I thought I would try a wide size. Overall, think it's a great buy. Will be trying another pair of wides. pumas are hard to find in my size with the colors and styles I love.", "I like the look. Kind of reminds me of golf shoes but with some style. The fitting is narrow, but I'm still comfortable wearing. Will probably have to break in these before true comfort is reached. I have a pretty narrow foot but like some added room, these shoes leave no wiggle room. My actual size in mens is an 8 but I always buy a 8.5. because I like room, with these wish I had gotten a 9. FYI, before I bought these tried them on in a store and 8.5 was good these seem to run a little smaller.", "Very nice. My husband likes it. Not as bright white as I had expected. I also bought a pair of Nike for my husband along with this Puma pair and the Nike looked a lot whiter.", "Bought for hubby not knowing if he would like them, it turns out he likes them a lot. I did not expect him to wear them much, yet he seems to want to wear them more than his others. I decided to buy another pair but there was such a great deal when I went back, I bought him 2 more pair. I got 2 pair for just $14 less than I paid for the 1 pair just 2 months prior. I should note that he is only using them as casual wear. They look really nice on him too. :D", "I read several reviews stating these run small. I didn't trust the reviews and ordered a 10.5 M. I wear 10.5 in every type of shoe and boot without fail except when I got these in size 10.5 M. The length was definitely to short. They also are very narrow which was good because I have very narrow feet. I returned them immediately and ordered 11 M.", "I bought these sneaker once before along time ago, so I decided to order them again. Well some how there not like before, the sneakers are tight & the glue to the souls on one of the sneakers, fell off after first usage. Don't understand why, bought the same size as last time & the old pair were great. Why this new pair was made so cheap is beyond me. Becareful when buying this sneakers. You might end up with a bad batch like me. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Gave this product 3 stars based on looks alone. I ordered my normal size but these sneakers are just plain uncomfortable. I\u2019ve try putting shoe trees in them to try and stretch them but so far they are just not comfortable to wear for any period of time. Problem is not in the length, it is more in the lack of comfort with the insole and across the arch. Maybe it will get better with time, but for now, they are certainly not my go to sneaker for comfort.", "As with all shoes, they were tight to begin with. After giving time to wear in they have performed well. The one thing I have noticed is they run a little large. I wear a size 12 but probably could wear these in size 11.5. I wear these as my daily shoes and have normal cotton socks, but when I have worn them for workouts with thinner socks they are big. It is a little annoying but nothing major. Since these are my daily sneakers it is not something I worry about. If I used them for workouts regularly then I would go for a smaller size.", "My ordinary shoe size he is nine and a half to 10. This shoe is extremely tight and narrow. It is definitely not true to size. I would have like to have exchanged the shoe for a full size larger to an 11. However, there would be a price increase involved up from $35 to $59.94. I tried to take care of this through \"chat,\" but was not successful in reaching a satisfactory conclusion. Somehow or another I got bounced off of the proper website to continue.", "My son absolutely loves these shoes. The shoe is more narrow than most other brands which is perfect for his narrow foot. The toe box is roomy but not too big. The support for a high arch is a little lacking but inserts correct that problem. The cushion support is comfortable and sturdy. The look of the shoe is sharp and athletic looking. He gets lots of compliments on them. Hopefully they wear as well as they look and feel.", "I hate shopping for shoes but when I find a pair that I like I stick with them. After finding my first pair of Puma shoes in a big box store and wearing them out I decided to see if Amazon carried them and am very happy that they do. The price was actually a couple bucks less than the big box store and the shoes are identical in every way. If your looking for a good fitting and nice looking pair of shoes to run around town in - look no further.", "While breaking them in, it has given me a flew blisters on the back of both my heels. But it has greatly improved as I broke them in. Been wearing them for jogging everyday. I suggest if you buy these shoes, put a few band-aids on the back of your heels until you feel comfortable with them. Maybe even wear an extra pair of socks.", "I bought this about 2 weeks ago and the sole is coming off and making a flapping noise every time I walk. I will not buy these shoes again!", "First of all, if you plan to buy this product make sure u dont change your mind the second u click purchase. its too late and theyve shipped it probably. But came in awesome condition, very happy with it all around. Would buy again. Hubby away on business so cant speak on fit yet but looks great.", "This is a good shoe for wearing around the house, but I can't wear them if I am wearing athletic socks. They are too tight in the toe box and pretty snug everywhere else. I never had a problem with this with Brooks, Adidas, or New Balance athletic shoes. So with that said, I wear them as house shoes, and they're very comfortable. But if I want to wear socks, I'd have to order one size bigger I think.", "I bought this pair of Pumas for my dad and he loves them. The fit is perfect, however I ordered one size up for more room in the toe box. The running shoe has a round toe design and my dad prefers a roomy fit. Otherwise, the design is sporty, the fit is comfortable for running or walking, and the color white is brilliant; older gents love white athletic sneakers lol. The package arrived earlier than expected. Thank you Amazon and Puma my dad appreciates your good products and services.", "I bought the sneakers to wear at work. I work at a home improvement store. I walk between 12,000 and 19,000 steps a day. I need something light and comfortable. They do it all. I bought the Nikes and they squeak when I walk. Well worth the money.", "I wish companies actually used LEATHER for shoes now days. These are vinyl and feel pretty cheaply made. Don\u2019t feel like they will last. For those with a high arch these have NO arch support. They mark up easily too which detracts from the looks. Got them on sale - I would NOT spend full price on them. The \u201cNew\u201d Puma brand / company is now where close to the old brand / company from the 80\u2019s.", "These were bought to replace my Salomon hiking shoes that I had been my go too hiking shoe. The Salomon shoes keep going up in price and I was looking for something ascetically different some I found these. They are slightly tight in the toe box but otherwise fit very well. They have enough support for a good bit of hiking but I may consider trying something else once these shoes are done.", "I still like narrow toed sneakers, I think they look better on my foot, but they're so hard to find these days. With the Tarzons I have the narrower toe than most sneakers and they are indeed comfortable and stylish enough to wear to casual events. I like them so much that I own four pairs now in various colors. The only downside, more of an observation than complaint, is the tongue shifts to the side at times, no lace loop to keep it in place. Other than that, it is a wonderful shoe!", "These shoes are a tight fit, but not too small so it ended up working well for me. The sole is well padded comfortable, my feet are never sore from walking or running. I personally find them stylish with the way the logos and highlights are designed. Just remember they do run a bit tight so keep that in mind if you have very wide feet. Saw some reviews about how these shoes get dirty. Are you serious? These are running shoes, of course they'll get dirty.", "I have always loved Puma athletic shoes! But, they seem to have forgotten how to properly size their products. The 12M that I had purchased were too tight. So, I ordered a pair of 13M in the exact same shoe (except color), and they were even TIGHTER than the 12M's. I have purchased my last pair of Puma shoes. By the way, Puma shoes are very nice shoes, but not worth much if they size them wrong.", "Initially, the shoes killed right below my ankles. They must have just needed breaking in to get rid of the stiffness. Awesome pair of shoes. I would buy these again. No shoes will ever get a five star from me because shoes just aren't made how they used to be and they're always expensive. Got these for a great deal though.", "My Puma sneakers arrived yesterday. I have not worn them outside yet. What caught my attention was the style of the sneaker. The sneaker modestly stands out with its multi dimensional features on the external inner & out sides. The sneaker size may need to be ordered a half size (the first pair ordered was my actual shoe size & they were returned) larger than your shoe size. My pair is the narrow & fits like a glove with tube socks. It\u2019s a comfortable fit light weight sneaker. I\u2019ll make an effort to post another review after wearing them for more than ten hours. I\u2019m hoping the sneaker will continue to perform exceptionally.", "Many of the comments indicate that I should buy a size bigger and wider because they are very narrow. I did not find this to be the case. I bought a half size bigger and it fit me perfect. I like how they look and feel and I'm happy with my putchase. I don't think people know their actaul foot size which is the reason for all the misinformation.", "When I first received these shoes, I noticed they fit tight. I wore them a few times working out hoping that they would stretch out and become comfortable. That was not the case, these shoes fit tight and the inserts suck. As I move side step during my workout, I feel the edges of the inserts, I would've returned these shoes, but I only paid $30 for them so not worth my time, but will not purchase again.", "Seems like Pumad on azon run a size small. When. You order them be sure to always order a size larger. The star given is ONLY based on the way the show fits and in this case one size too small. Other wise the shoe itself is gorgeous", "Shoes came and they\u2019re way better looking than the original pics. Put them on immediately and was blown away at the high level of comfort. That\u2019s why the head line says \u201c Force to be reckoned with\u201d. Nike , Rebook look out now.... I could almost wear these as dress shoes.... mine were mostly white with silver swoops and black accents. Bad to the bone PS... Had these pumas for over a month now and they look like new, no issues no problems I highly recommend", "Only owned these for a short time, and they are my going out on the town pair. If you have wide feet make sure you get that version, I have a non-wide Puma Cell Surin 2 ( a year old and no issues ) and they squeeze my feet a bit even at the same size. Puma makes a high quality product, would recommend to anyone.", "Thank you for the speedy delivery. The fit is almost perfect. I think 9.5 would have been to big. Your recommendation of 10 is not close. I find Pumas run bigger than others. I like the shoe as I did when my dad bought me my first football cleats many moons ago. Thanks", "The price was right so I overlooked some of the comments. I have only worn them a few times and so far the fit is perfect, the looks great and I almost bounce in my walk. I am however partial to Pumas. At my age, all I can do for exercise is walk and a little lifting. Walking in these have been a great experience. I had just bought Filas for a higher price and far less quality. wish I had returned them!", "This is a well crafted shoe and attractive in appearance. Ordered based on description and cushioning for running/walking at the gym treadmill. Unfortunately on inspection not the case, arch is not flexible, heavy build and breathability appears low. However if you are looking for a general purpose shoe - check it out.", "The sole is rock hard and stiff as a board. It's also not true to size; the shoe felt significantly smaller than the advertised size. It's not comfortable at all; I wouldn't walk in these let alone run in them. Right in the donation bin they go.", "I like the look of these shoes and I am keeping them for casual wear. The shoes are just a touch narrow and just a touch stiff. Length wise they fit me perfectly. The shoes are not so narrow that I have to return the shoes but they are not the most comfortable fit on me. So I will not use these for long walks in the park or running.", "I bought these for work as I have an arch issue and I cannot wear my normal boots or flats. I was looking for a good brand that would survive my constant walking but also look professional (as much as tennis shoes can, anyway). While I searched for women, I was disappointed in all the pinks and blues. I needed silver or white with the black. So, I looked in the men's shoes and found these. I wear a size 9 in womens and a size 7 in mens so I purchased them. I have not been disappointed! Thank you!", "I have these same shoes and they fit me perfectly. I purchased these for my boyfriend but he has diabetes so I may should have gotten a wider shoe. These sneakers are form fitting so need to account for socks when purchasing. They look great, good for running, working out, walking just know your audience before buying.", "Like with many items sold through Amazon, this product was inferior. Sized nearly 1 1/2 sizes smaller than ordered, as well as narrower in width... the shoe itself was stiff, unyielding and ridiculously poorly manufactured. I\u2019ve bought over 75 items through Amazon in the past year, excluding groceries, and 26-31 items have had to be returned \u2014which is a waste of time.", "My wife ordered it for me but they are actually creating problem if I wear them outdoor. Okeys for like mall and movies but not if you want to walk more.", "This is a great looking running shoe, if you happen to like the lighter shoe colors, as I do. Support is good, although the shoes do keep my feet a little warmer than I would like. This pair of shoes served as a replacement for my worn 10 year old Nike Air Max. Let's see how it performs...", "I love everything about these shoes, very light weight and oh so comfortable!! I ordered size 11W and the fit is perfect, even with athletic socks. I love these so much I think I\u2019ll order the Pumas Cell Surin 2 FM Crosstrainers, if I can get them in my size; perfect compliment to these I have now!!! Thank You Puma!!! Great shoes!!!", "The room in the toe area is great. Just slightly too large, but I believe 12 would be too small. I had to get an insert for my heel pain, but seem to be okay. Wish Amazon had in black, not a fan of white shoes, makes me feel like I'm heading to the golf course instead of going to the hospital for my shift.", "Overall, I think this style of shoes are running more narrow than Nike and New Balance. I have been wearing mostly Nike in the past 20 years, and sometimes I got a Puma and other brand. This style, is consistent with other Puma shoes I got, which is usually more narrow that others. A clear comparison is that I purchase this shoes and a pair of NB at the same time. I tried them both, this model is clearly more narrow and \"thin\". not for feet that are higher \"back\"", "Since these are pumas I expect them to be narro, hard, and flat. They basically have no arch support. If you have really wide feet i suggest you order a wide and they might not even work. They have terribly flat insoles. Would would great for someone with flat feet. Overall they are okay. They look nice and have geld up well so far.", "These fit, feel and run great! Very comfortable to wear right out of the box no break in needed. Some of the best looking running shoes on the market. They double as super comfortable casual walking shoes and pair nicely with jeans or shorts. Great delivery experience as well.", "Puma finally got this right. I have bought Puma shoes in the past and they were always 2 sizes too small, this is a perfect fit. They also started making this shoe in the wide size, another plus. Last, the comfort is amazing. For the price and comfort, well done.", "For personal reasons, I did not try on the shoes until approximately 2 months after receiving them. I immediately became aware that the right shoe is larger than the left shoe although they are both marked as the same size. It is now too late to return them. Amazon is usually pretty good with quality, but I'll have to donate these shoes to a homeless shelter or someplace. Check your shoes when they first arrive!", "The pad inside of shoes just came right out didnt seem like the right padding for shoes. Kind of sad they have made these shoes cheaply now cause i have gotten these type of shoes before and the fit was amaizng and quality of shoe was worth the price now they cost too much for the cheap product.", "I use these for pickleball even though they are designed for running. They are very comfortable and their appearance is noted by others who see them. I like the white exterior. It is easily noticeable. I would recommend these shoes for anyone looking for a comfortable, athletic shoe.", "These Puma sneakers are amazing from the second I put them on. The soft foam optimal insole is soooooo comfortable. They are stylish without being over the top. It's been awhile since I purchased the Puma brand but I took a chance because I like the style. I will check out others in the future. At this price point they would be hard to beat.", "Decided to try men's style when I saw the price of men's Taxon is HALF the price of the women's. I'm a woman and have had 2 pairs of women's Tazon previously. It's almost exactly the same. I'd say the men's are actually a tad more comfortable. More cushioning and roomy in heel.", "These are hands down the best sneakers I\u2019ve ever owned. They are comfy, sleek, & sexy. They are very well made and rather quite awesome in general. You will love these. I have toe issues so I ordered my size 9 in the wide toe format. Plenty of room there and great comfortable support with these. You must own a pair of these!!! 5 Stars", "I like Puma shoes. I have a narrow flat foot, but these shoes still fit me good. They are a very good value and are not made in China! They are made in Vietnam. Not a great fan of Vietnam, but better than China. They are made well and look very nice.", "i had purchased two other versions of the Puma cross trainer. First was a 9.5 Wide and it was just a bit to big in the heel (gave it to my son), then got these in a normal width and returned it but like goldilocks this pair (9W) fit JUST RIGHT. Love the look and support they give me when working out. Highly recommend these shoes, and they look great too!", "This is the 2nd pair of Puma running I have owned. I like the fit and the style. The shoe holds up to normal wear and tear and can be wiped clean to continue looking new. The shoe isn't really flexible to expand for a wider foot, so keep this in mind when choosing your shoe size. It does saying running shoe, but I dont use these shoes when jogging and prefer a lighter shoe with more cushion in the heel. A great shoe for relaxed weekends.", "Unfortunately, the heel was loose compared to the rest of the shoes attributes. my feet kept slipping out of the heal area. Toe box was fine, a little narrow in front of the arch support. So I am returning this pair as they do not fit properly. Really nice design!", "Worn only twice but already I'm noticing cracks. I expected better quality from a $50 brand name sneaker. Would not order again. I would just drive down to Payless and get the same-quality sneaker for $28. I give this shoe 6 months before it flatlines. Maybe that's some people's expectation of mid-priced sneaker lifespan. Not mine.", "Now I know why they sell the shoe in both medium and wide, in all sizes, as these run narrow. I should have ordered a wide which likely would have fit like a medium. Length wise they fit perfect. Hoping they stretch a little as the box got thrown out, so no returning them for a wide. Arch support is on the low side, but acceptable. Otherwise, great shoes that are solidly constructed.", "The wide width is not very wide. My feet are a little cramped, but not to the point of not being able to wear them. I do like the comfort of the inside of the sneakers. In the future, I don't think I will be able to purchase this item again.", "Ordered these for my boyfriend who was literally wearing old sneakers with holes in the toes. When he first put them on he wasn\u2019t sure if he liked them or if they were comfortable enough. After wearing them the whole day and being on his feet all day, he said they are the most comfortable shoes he has ever had. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s come home from work in three years and his feet haven\u2019t been in pain.", "I wear size 12 but for these shoes that was too tight. I exchanged for a 13 and still was a bit tight. Foolishly I thought it would get better with wear. The improvement was marginal. If I walk more than 20 minutes I still feel the tight discomfort. I haven't even used the laces yet. Nice shoes, but run too small.", "Not bad for the money but does need some quality control. Right shoe is a little off. Also could not get black in Wide so settled for white. But hope these do not come apart like my New Balance did. Got these because they are not cloth.", "I've owned these before...bought again cuz they look pretty fresh (yeh, like early b-boy fresh) and cuz you can get them in wide width. That said, they are not leather and they dont breathe well so they are hard to wear in the heat of the summer. Also, i notice that they get dirty much faster than my prior pair. No very hard to get/keep clean.", "Buyer beware! Very tight around the foot. Its a size 12. I tried loosening the laces and still had issues. I always wore regular sneakers never had problems. I think it has something to do with the Puma line itself. I Had to get rid of them because it was actually hurting my feet.", "I have bought my 4th pair this week. I got my pair of Puma Tazon 6 and absolutely fell in love with the shoes. They are by far the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Highly recommend them for many reasons comfort, style, longevity, easy to take care of and last a long time. I bought my 1st pair 2 years ago and there at least worn 2-3 times a week and they still clean up and look amazing.", "I have had an issue with rolling ankles while walking or running in the past. Just ordered my second pair, I still have my first pair that lasted about a year. I walk and run constantly at my job. Only getting a new pair because I've worn my first set and even then with worn tread and small holes due to my work I have never rolled my ankles in these shoes. I recommend them highly, I will never buy a different brand again.", "bought in Dec. 2019 is now Feb and insole is ripped and sole attached at toe is coming away from upper. Crappy qualty from what used to be a good shoe company", "Great looking shoe. I read all the reviews and ordered a half size larger and wider. Shoe was to narrow to wear, so I cannot comment on that, just the fit of the shoe. I was able to return it immediately and everything was handled professionally.", "I would rate these five stars for the shoes and quality but I was shipped the wrong ones so therefore I cannot. I bought these for my husband, every birthday I get him new pumas. Last year were the black and red this year I ordered these (black and puma silver). The ones I received were all black. The quality of the shoes are great, the fit was great, and the shipping on time but you can't even see the puma logos due to the all black. Happy with my purchase I just wish the shoes were the correct colors I ordered.", "Fit is snug, but good. Style looks great on my feet. I set out shopping for Adidas Stan Smith's or Rod Laver's to wear in the summer (cruise wear, urban casual with blue blazers). I like these more because I have BIG feet (14), and white shoes with no stripping would make my feet look too huge and dorky. Glory be the Puma comeback!", "Shoes look good and very lite weight \ud83d\udc4c. Right shoe fits tighter than the left shoe on the sides. I have flat feet and was able to walk around stores for 2 hours comfortablely. They are my 2nd pair of Pumas and surely not my last. 4 \ud83c\udf1f because if the right shoe being tighter.", "These are very comfortable, fit great if you have a wide width, fairly true to size. The only downside is the arch support and padding, you will need to buy insoles if you are like me and like a lot of padding and support. Other than that, nice looking and fit!", "After 20+ years of being a Reebok man I'm now PUMA from here on out. Never had shoes that fit and felt so awesome right out of the box. Walked around the neighborhood (5 miles) and felt like it was nothing. Trying to figure out which other style to buy next.", "Tried them on and they were too small. But I read reviews saying they will loosen up. My feet was killing me. I wear a size 13, and the shows are too tight. Do not purchase because you will hurt your feet. I am returning them.", "When I first put these shoes on I thought they were uncomfortable and tight. After walking in them for about a week I can say they are very comfortable with great cushion. I don't run a lot but I walk many miles a day and these shoes feel like much more expensive running shoes. I wear shoes out quickly. Only time will tell how they'll wear and I'll update my review.", "I have been purchasing these sneakers for 2 years now. They are the most comfortable I've ever worn and I'm 60. But buyer beware. I have to purchase new ones much more often than the others. They seem to break down quickly. (I walk about 15 miles a week) So instead of my usual new pair every three months, I buy a pair every two. Not too bad since they are reasonably priced.", "These are one of the best shoes I have ever owned. I bought these shoes for walking and its comfortable so I ended up using in my world travel. These shoes are not meant for hiking but I used them (they do not perform well as hiking shoes). My point is I have used them in all sorts of environments and they have lasted me a over a year. I have use these shoes in Glaciers in Norway to mountains in Argentina to daily use at home. I love them!", "beginning of toe box is very snug, if not too tight. It feels more so when sit down on a chair. Meshed Tazon6 was amazingly cushy and comfortable and that's why I bought this but it is just good enough for gym leg day.", "I bought my usual shoe size and they fit like a glove, though maybe I've just got wide feet, but these shoes are just a tiny bit tight on the sides, though as I wear them more often maybe they'll stretch a little to fit. Overall, they're comfortable, light, and the material seems to be quality stuff, so I'm definitely happy with my purchase though I got them half-off so maybe wait for them to be on sale because I think the normal price is a little steep for my wallet personally.", "Best puma sneaker I've found so far constantly get compliments", "They were great shoes early on, and offered a lot of support and comfort. But after a few months of use, they lost the support that they previously gave. I did try to contact PUMA regarding the shoes to see if they had a replacement shoe insert (since the last one was worn out) but they never got in contact with me, and I'm a little disappointed from that. Might try a different brand on my next shoe and see if I have better luck.", "I have not had a better pair of shoes. My Puma's have held up great, best fitting and most comfortable shoes that I have worn. I wear them daily and I am just so impressed with the quality of these shoes.", "I actually like the shoes. My only issue is that I noticed a few weeks after I ordered them, they have a \"wide\" size available. I don't normally order wide (only sometimes depending on the shoe), but I wish I would have ordered the Wide for these pair. These are a bit tight and it's taking me a minute to break them in. I would only buy these again if they have \"wide\" available; if they do, I'll buy another pair in a year or so... if not... I'll find a different shoe.", "Wore this while playing basketball and badly injured a tendon in my foot because the shoe has no arch support. I've been an athlete my whole life and have never owned a pair of shoes this bad. My first and last Pumas.", "I'd been waiting for these to go back on sale after seeing them at the sale price a few months ago. Amazon's Prime Day put them on-sale plus another 30% discount! Obviously, a great time to buy them... but alas.. they don't fit!!", "I had to take off 2 stars because the pair we got had a defect. The insole had an uneven ridge and wasn\u2019t fulling flush with sneaker edge. That doesn\u2019t bother my husband but if you are like me...the princess and the pea... they would have had to go back", "Everytime I get new shoes I swear they get thinner and thinner. Fit slightly larger than expected as Pumas in the past have run small in my opinion. Got 11 wide, 10.5 wide would have been perfect.", "I only wear these for special occasions, like doctor visits etc., don't want to get them soiled, these shoes pop, and people take notice of them, it remains to be seen, how well they wear, as this is the first time I've ordered this specific brand of shoe. For the time being, I'm very satisfied with these shoes.", "Shoes need reinforced shoelace holes. The laces cut through the holes in three different locations after 3 months of use, making them un-usable and un-fixable (had to toss them).", "I was a little hesitant to order shoes online, however this purchase was a good decision. The description and shoe size I ordered was perfect. I have a little wider feet so the 2E (width size) fit just as expected. Not too tight and but still securing my foot in the shoe.", "This is the second time I have bought these shoes so I knew what I was getting before ordering.

Very good looking pair of shoes. The only concern about the shoes is that the insoles were not removable; which would be fine except that I wear orthotics in my shoes and I've found in the past that my orthotics work better under the insoles.", "This shoe is comfortable as a general workout shoe, or for occasional runs of a mile or two. There are other shoes better-suited to frequent or long runs. One intangible - they look good. I've actually had people approach me to look at them more closely, followed quickly by compliments on their appearance.", "I needed a pair of comfortable running type shoes that I could wear for work, as I work in a corporate environment but I also do physical labor no a regular basis. These are holding up very well, and are extremely comfortable. I owned the Tazon 5 shoe before these, and these are a suitable improvement on their predecessors.", "My kids\u2019 school colors are red and black and I love these shoes. These are men\u2019s shoes so I just bought the size I would wear in men\u2019s and not women\u2019s. Wish they had these in women\u2019s but either way I absolutely love them!!!", "These are nice looking shoes and they fit nice and snug for cross-training activities. But there is no support and ZERO stability. My feet were pronating hard from the very first step, even when I was trying to not let my feet roll in. They were listed as a good shoe for flat feet and over-pronators, but in order to wear these even for walking I'm going to have to add inserts.", "Excellent all purpose shoe. Have another pair that lasted well over five years, with occasional hard wear. The white on this shoe scuffs easily, but can be cleaned with soap and water to remove all but the darkest marks. Bought this pair as a replacement for the older ones. Recommend these shoes as comfortable, sturdy, and long lasting.", "I bought these for my husband and he loves them! They are real and just as bright white and red as in the pictures. They came on time and are great quality which is to be expected with the Puma brand.", "These shoes are pretty comfortable. Unfortunately I am the type o person who likes to slip on and go. The back is really firm which can be sturdy right at the back of the ankle which means you have to untie them to put them on, but otherwise I am able to run and jog in them comfortably.", "I finally found a pair of shoes that fit my slightly wide feet. It took ordering and returning eight pair of shoes before these. These shoes are very comfortable and provide great support. I recommend these for the wide foot man.", "Great looking sneakers but when I was younger and athletic, I would have never worn these as running shoes. They aren\u2019t built like running shoes. That said, they look great, especially with jeans. They are also extremely comfortable.", "Great shoe at a great price, slightly snug feel, but not truly size altering. I may have gone for a half size larger than I did, but overall very satisfied. I work at a building that processes a lot of blood, so I find it hard to find an all white shoe made of a material that can be easily wiped off, thankfully this fits the bill!", "Production quality is good, but sizing is completely wrong. I ordered 10.5 in Men's size because I normally wear this size, but the length and width were on part with a size 9 narrow. Lucky for me, I'll only wear them for a few hours then change back to street shoes. I have mixed feelings as far as overall rating, but Amazon did what they're here for and the failure of PUMA to create shoes with an accurate fit is on the manufacturer.", "The shoe is comfortable, but tends to be a little tight around the toe. The durability has seemed to be good. It's comfortable. The only thing my husband says he'd change is the toe tightness.", "These are good walking, running, standing shoes. They seem fairly durable. The paneling on the front toe makes it harder for them to catch and tear. Really great if you wear them in everyday life instead of just a track or a trail. They are a little more narrow than I thought they would be. They're also hard to keep clean, but I think they look pretty cool.", "Like Nike, these shoes run a little small. I swapped for one size larger and they seem to fit fine. Arch support is a bit shallower than I had hoped. But overall these are good shoes at an excellent price.", "I love the shoes that are perfect I planned to use these for clinicals and work. You really can not see the sliver if you scrub pants are long enough to hide it.", "This is a well put together pair of comfortable Pumas. Haven't wore Pumas since the early 2000's and wow. The fit and quality have came a long way. I really enjoy these shoes.", "This is my first set of Pumas and I really like them. At first I wasn't sure if they were going to be a good fit, but after a few days of breaking them in they felt great. I do crossfit a few times a week and work at a warehouse where I'm on my feet all day, these are awesome. The same pair was $20 more at JCPenney.", "I know this isnt Amazons problem (probably my feet's problem, more than anything else) but the insoles are junk. I had to buy new ones before i could wear these for any period of time. There is no arch support whatsoever! I know it's the manufacturer... what can I say... I have plantar faciaitas. One would think that these sneaker manufacturers would use better insoles...", "Love the shoes. Wear them to work since I\u2019m on my feet and moving around a lot. Very comfortable. I got them in a US size 9 which is my normal size. Might have gone up a half size for comfort since they feel a little snug compared to my other shoes.", "These are nice shoes. Ordered an 8 but it\u2019s more like an 8.5 but it works out because I have to use inserts so the extra space isn\u2019t bothersome. I thought it was odd to have this shoe larger than my other size 8 pumas.", "I like to order the same sneakers so I Know what I am getting the seem to last a while if you treat them nice. This model is narrow and but after wearing them for a few days they become comfortable. With the sizes over 12, you can end up with sneakers that look huge on you these ones look great not like large clogs. Happy with them so far", "Shipping was fast... These sneakers are probably the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. A lot more comfortable than certain brands that cost way more... Always get compliments when I wear them...", "I can't find a good replacement for my old Puma Tazon 6 3D. They were so comfy and looked great. The new Tazon models are made out of less comfortable material and the toe box is more narrow. My normal size of 7.5 was too small, but when I went up to a size 8, the longer instep made my toes hurt since the material is stiff. I have since tried (and returned) several other similar Puma models and am giving up. Time to find a new favorite sneaker.", "These shoes are sturdy. Maybe not ideal for running, but I like that they are easy to clean and not like the cloth ones that you have to put in the washer so they don't look dingy. Just take a wet cloth and run over and looks good again.", "I've gotten a lot of compliments on my new shoes. An older guy who is very happy with my new shoes. Thought they were a little flashy for me, but I got used to them. Feel like a new man wearing these. I've got atrophy of both feet. But they fit well,and look better. They fit very comfortably. Thanks for a great product. And a good price as well.", "Very light weight and comfortable. Incredible that Puma makes wide shoes without making it look funny", "These have been worn 2-3 times a week for the last 5 months. They have worn out significantly...inside and out!! A bit disappointing that they haven\u2019t lasted longer.", "Sole cushion didn\u2019t last long. Felt cheap from the get go. First pair of Pumas I\u2019ve owned. Most likely will not purchase from the again.", "Only gave them a 4 because I haven't had them very long or worn them much so far. Look and feel great tho! Have liked and appreciated Puma brand years ago, but haven't had a pair in several years, but I'm expecting good things due to past experiences.", "I like the way they look, how they feel and they look good with jeans or slacks! These are my second pair! I couldn't resist buying them when i saw the price drop! I was already planning to get them, but catching them on sale made it even better! I might get another pair!!", "My husband loves these shoes! (and he\u2019s oddly picky when it comes to tennis shoes) They fit perfect, are comfortable, and they match with everything. Very good quality. Highly recommend!", "I bought these for my husband who has flat feet and wears a size 14. He says they are extremely comfortable and would like another pair! I am definitely bookmarking this product to get them for him again once his current pair are worn out.", "These shoes are great. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for my son. He hasn't worn his yet while I'm struggling not to wear mine everyday. They are super comfortable. I always grab Pumas with the soft foam when I catch a good sale. I tell my friends they're Ugg level comfort in an athletic shoe.", "I bought them for my husband. His face said it all, he was in awe. He loved them, said they fit great. They look very nice. He wears them for a dress sneaker. I'm sure they are good for sports.", "Looks great out of the box. I wear a 10 EE in boots ie. Red wings, justins, martins. I just slip right into these things. It leaves just enough wiggle room at the tip which i like for high impact training.", "This is the 3rd pair I owed in about 2 years time. The first 2 pairs held up pretty good. Usual wear, soles worn and the rest of the sneaker held up well. Was very happy and lasted overall about 8 months a pair until this last pair. Had just about 3 months and the inner heal material just disintegrated, on both sneakers. Don't know what they did but my first 2 pair held up fine in this area. They are very uncomfortable to wear now with no protection for my heals. Very disappointed.", "The size i order is just half number more than I usually wear because many customers recommended as the shoes is too small. Surprisingly fit perfectly if not slightly bigger. Also It is high quality shoes. I use is mostly for indoor exercise bike and strength training and function comfortly.", "Great looking comfortable. Little small but that\u2019s why you always try on before purchasing. These are nice quality always been a Nike and adidas wearer.", "These shoes did not last very long. It was a great set of shoes but the leather is poor quality and the activity of tying them caused an eyelet to fail. I rated them for comfort while they lasted.", "I Don't like how the TOE AREA numbs my toe within a few minutes. I haven't worn it. I WOULD very much like to return. It's STILL brand new.", "I ordered a size 9.5 although I'm a 9. Glad that I did, they run a tad small. Very comfortable excellent quality material at a good price.", "Shoe needs more padding underneath to be considered a running shoe. I think that is just how PUMA makes all their shoes though. Feels terrible if you run on hard surfaces but besides that they are good shoes.", "These shoes are great.... even better looking than the photos. The fit is almost perfect, just a tiny bit tight and narrow.", "I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them. He wears a 10 and that is what I bought and they fit perfect. They are very nice an they look great in.", "Shoe looks good and fit was perfect for me. Don't use it for running but mainly just for workouts and running errands.", "I have worn size 12 for a long time, have a narrow foot and these shoes are very snug fitting, not too small, but very snug. They are getting more comfortable as I wear them. Be careful about width , length is fine.", "great sneakers. I bought this after my adidas running shoes wore out . Very happy with the purchase and style and have gotten a lot of compliments very comfortable and good price. I ordered another pair with different colors already", "Nice looking sneakers got around a year out of them Throwing the first ones out and just ordered my second pair there A good price 51 R-J--", "Very good all-around athletic shoe. The outside is still in good shape after 6 months of use, but the padding is worn down and I need to replace them. I\u2019m buying another pair because they\u2019re comfortable and affordable.", "I have a normal width foot. Width seems ok, but tight vertically. I'm wondering if the wide model would be more comfortable. I expect they will stretch a little and break in. First time I've ordered shoes online. I usually go to sporting goods store and try them on first. I probably would have noticed and tried the W model had I tried them on first.", "Nice shoe. We love the look and design. Definitely true to size. First time buying Puma, however we would purchase again.", "This is my 2nd purchase of the same shoe. I work out quite often and play basketball frequently. These shoes were durable and allowed me to make quick turns on the court without any visible give or damage to the shoes. The only reason why I am buying a 2nd pair because my shoe was subject to my little niece putting a knife through my first pair (don't ask). Otherwise the shoes have lasted roughly two months and were a great purchase.", "Great shoes. Great retro look. Well made. I'm a large man with wide feet and i go through shoes quickly. These shoes fit well, are very comfortable and high quality. I purchased two more pair just to put away.", "these shoes look good for about the first two months.. then I saw one guy at the gym with the same shoes and they were all run-over.. about a week later, I see two other guys with the same shoe, same color, and both pair look cheap and tore up... had my pair less than 2 months and already have a small hole in bottom-left-shoe near the toe... and it's only going to get worse..", "Somehow the left foot although it fits is a bit tight, that might just be me but otherwise it feels great very comfortable and light weight.", "Shoes are super comfortable. First Pumas purchased and will look for more. Had read in previous reviews that they were made narrow so I ordered a \u201cwide\u201d but didn\u2019t need that. Traditionally wear Nike\u2019s and feel they have a very similar cut/feel.", "Great shoes. Nice and comfortable. Arrived timely and in brand new condition. Fit perfectly right away. Overall very happy with this purchase. Thank you.", "I like the sneaker style but it is a little tighter than I expected. I think I will get it in a size 10 1/2 next to see if is better. They look great despite it being tight. I would recommend just buy a half a size bigger to fit more comfortably", "I love my Puma shoes I just wish the price wasn't so high I don't think these shoes are worth what the customer wants them for only had him for less than 6 months and shoes already falling apart don't buy that product again", "The shoes fit correctly in length. They do fit snug in width but not to the point where they are uncomfortable. The sole is cushioned and super comfortable. They are really stylish and look great with black jeans. I really love these shoes.", "Nice but feels more like a low slung running or track shoe rather than a full support sports sneaker. Fits slightly snug vs typical mens size 9", "Love the look and materials. Very sturdy construction. I have a long but narrow foot for my size, so I disregarded reviews stating that the wide size should be considered because they run narrow. I'll heed the warnings next time. They fit, but are a little snug. Great shoes overall.", "These are very comfortable. Just started a new walking program and needed new shoes. These leave no bruises or blisters and feel very light. Only used them for one week so far but would recommend them.", "Always worried about the size and never bought Puma before, but they fit perfectly. They are comfortable and nice looking.", "This is my third pair of this sneaker. The first pair were fantastic and I wore them down over a couple of years without any problem, the most comfortabke sneaker I've worn..

My feet are really wide so I had to use a different lasing style to adjust to the arch but other than that they're great.", "I had not bought Puma in a while but I must say I am very pleased with these. I did a mile yesterday on the treadmill like nothing. I am sure I could walk for hours. Very comfortable for someone like me who wears Wide. I actually wore them to work today. Not the best choice for an office setting but hey, they are DAT comfortable!", "I didn\u2019t realize I ordered a men\u2019s size so I had to return as they were too big. Otherwise I really like them they just didn\u2019t have them in my size", "Bought it on May 6 and it\u2019s as comfortable and feels great now after 6 months as when I bought it. The price was very good and the quality of the shoes is excellent. The customer service was also great the shipping was excellent I received them quick. Thank You", "This lair of shoes feel great. I have a slightly wide foot and thought it might not work out for me. I have used them on my last 4 walks which are about 4 to 5 miles depending on time and feet are not tired or ache after.", "I've had the shoes for a week and have worn them 8+ hours each day and have felt instant relief of foot/ back pain.

Well made, great fit and support, look great, and help ones feet survive long shifts at woek", "I LOVE Puma's and my boyfriend who has been joining me in a lot of my workouts was in need of a new shoe so I got these as a gift and now he LOVES them. We go for 3-4 mile walks daily, some jogging, lots of fitness classes such as circuits/boot camps with lots of cardio and jumping and these provide perfect amount of arch support. He was also cursed with totally flat feet and these help with that as well.", "Bought 2 pair for Christmas one for my son in-law and son. Both really like how comfortable they are and how well they fit. My son-in-law was especially pleased because I also bought his toddler son a similar pair that fit great!

These shoes are very nice. High quality materials. Shipping as always was fast.", "These are very comfortable high-quality tennis shoes. They are also well-made and have a very stylish look. My son loves them. He has a wide 4 foot, he says that these give him enough toe room. I\u2019ve since bought other Puma\u2019s for him.", "I am well pleased with this shoe. It fits as expected and is comfortable. I haven't had them long enough to give a good review on how they hold up, but other reviews I read gave them good ratings.", "These are good training shoes. But NOT running shoes. If you are logging road miles, seek another style.", "They are very good with stability, breathable, and decent comfort. No complaints, I don't wear them as often though because I want them to last quite a while.", "The overall quality is okay. I expected more of I'm being honest. Puma is a big brand and I felt like this shoe didn't necessarily deliver. But the design is nice and it fit fine.", "Love these shoes for weight lifting, but I ordered the 9.5 in the wide size and my foot just \"floated\" in these. Puma is a good shoe, but their sizing is all over the place. Thank god for amazon and their easy return policies!", "Nothing to dislike.....packaging was great, shoes looked exactly what they would when buying from the store, and it was the correct size.", "i have bought this same shoe 3 other times and every time it fit perfectly. this last pair was a disaster.

They appear to be up to par as far as how they were assembled but they are super tight.", "The insoles that come with the shoe are terrible and were worn out within a month and a half.

These are so comfortable and reasonably Priced,.. Nice to have a Clean Pair of White Athletic shoes....", "Fits very comfortable and better than expected.

I'll buy my shoes where I can see the from now on.", "For the price ($50+) it's a decent shoe. I wear a size 8, but I order all my shoes a half size up. It's a little stiff/snug around the ankle, but I'm hoping after some wear and tear it loosens up. There is little to no arch support, and when you put inserts in, it makes it a tight fit in the toe area.

As a coach need good kicks for all the running around and support needed. Found this sneaker to be way too tight...Maybe a difference in sizing...but always order 10.5.

This is my second pair of Tazons and they are the only shows I can comfortably wear for extended periods.", "I love these shoes. I purchased them based on an orthopedic article I read about shoes that were good for Achilles tendon issues.

I will have to try and super glue this as I do not have time to break in a new pair of boots before my trip. I am very disappointed in what I thought was a high quality pair of boots that have begun to fall apart after 3 weeks of light to medium use.", "Very comfortable from the very first time wearing. However after a couple of weeks of wear, the soles are separating from the shoes at the back over the heel. Would have expected shoes this expensive to wear better. Very disappointed.", "Ok, I've had these before and could normally use them for just about anything and they'd hold up for 2+ years. These ones do not seem to be on the same road to praise that I have had with Salomon footwear in the past. The rubber front toe area is peeling away from the upper leather toe cover. Considering I bought these a few months back and have been in flip flops most of the summer, I was a bit ticked off when I pulled these out for camping this past weekend and noticed the issue. Now, the peeling is not terrible -yet- but we all know the downward spiral on shoes once a seam or stitch separates.", "90+ miles in these shoes: Hikes 8 miles, or less, 5 stars. Over 8 miles, 2 stars. My experience with my feet. Turns out that over 8 miles my feet get longer, wider, and swell. Because these shoes are not available in wider sizes I would have to get a \"clown shoe\" size to accommodate my foot changes. Will continue to use for short hikes after work, but useless for longer hikes.", "Love these boots! Period! They had a great feel right out of the box. I have hiked and packed hundreds of miles in them this past summer and fall and have not had one blister, and not one problem with the construction/function of these boots. Hiked through streams, wet mountain meadows and snow with the Gore-tex membrance working flawlessly. Boots are designed for backpacking and yet they feel just a good on my feet as my lightweight North Face hiking shoes do, with the added bonus of great support over varied terrain and the way they relieve foot fatigue. Likedt them so much I bought a pair for my son and he loves them as well.", "The left boot fit perfectly. The right boot had issues. The top of the right boot pressed down on the top of my foot, causing soreness. I ordered a replacent pair. Same problem, same boot. This must be a defective lot, which justifies the great price ($130). I've never had this issue with any other boot, so I know it's not my feet. I may try ordering these next year after this defective batch is all sold.", "This is a great boot. I spent the last two years in and out of surgery for foot and ankle problems, and this boot provides the advanced arch and ankle support that I need. All of the materials are superior quality, and the production and fabrication are first-rate. The boot is also surprisingly light, yet it still provides adequate cushion on rock surfaces. The break-in period (in my experience) was pretty much out-of-the-box-and-on-the-trail; it really was that quick. They sort of remind me of Nam web boots in weight, but are as tough as leather boots with rubber Vibram soles. Very happy with these boots.", "I chose these shoes after googling \"best hiking boots 2017\" and finding this boot on multiple lists. I bought these in anticipation of a trip to Copenhagen. Walked a couple miles a day for a week before the trip to break them in. These were the only shoes I took on the trip and they carried me many miles without complaint. Paired with these Carhartt wool socks, ( I had no issues walking 10-15 miles every day for two weeks. I also biked quite a bit, and found these to be light enough shoes to be not annoying on a bike. All in all, I was 100% happy with my purchase.", "PROS: - Very comfortable. No issues with the interior comfort of my foot, even after 10 hours of walking thru the concrete jungle of NYC and the subterranean caverns and tunnels underneath. - I like the look of the boot- Masculine. Not hipster wear, but possible yuppie wear. - Roomy toe-box, so I can wear my thick 90% wool socks without a problem. CONS: - This is a big CON for me... The laces are slippery, meaning they refuse to stay tied- even after a double knot! One would think that a company which makes hiking boots would research the best material to make laces from.", "One of the best pairs of hiking boots I've ever owned. Stiff ankle support was reassuring on Angels Landing in Zion and on the Peekaboo Loop in Bryce. The day before we hiked Bryce, it snowed, and the trail was muddy - good waterproof protection, thought I didn't sink my boot into water. I am now looking for other opportunities to wear them because they are really comfortable shoes. The lacing system allows practically infinite flexibility with regard to how tight you want to lace the ankles. I will buy another pair of Salomons when the time comes, but that might not be for a while - these are very light but industrial strength!", "I've worn these excellent boots on hikes through the Himalayas, the Japanese Alps, Mt. Fuji, northern Vietnam, and many day hikes for the last 2 years or so. They give me the support my pitifully weak ankles crave, have admirable grip, and are mighty comfortable. I walked through many a deep mud puddle and stream without anything seeping through to my socks. The laces are strong and long and I never have to worry if they're going to snap off when I'm trying to go extra tight. So far the boots are holding up well with only some slight separation on the outside heel of each one. These boots are worth every penny.", "I went to REI to test fit, then I ordered via Amazon (to save a lot). I've got about 10mi a week in the Colorado mountains, for the past 2 months. I'd wish I had these in Iraq and Afghanistan. The ankle support is fantastic. I have yet to have an ankle roll. Grip is out of this world. Just yesterday, I descended a 200' hill with pea gravel. Although it was like skiing downhill, the boots never gave up and increased my confidence, speed and control. Laces are long and strong. Eyelets are smoothed to prevent cutting the laces. There are two camber locks per boot, which secures the laces. Really, an incredible design.", "Clearly a great quality boot. Supportive, waterproof, somewhat breathable, and nice looking. I docked it a star because, to me, it's heavy and I also don't care for the upper lacing system. It just takes too long and the laces that come with them are like 12\" too long. I guess that's good, though, because with the lace material they've chosen, unless you double tie them, they quickly come untied. Perhaps these are normal attributes of a boot of this type. Admittedly, I normally buy less structured, lighter boots. Usually Salomon.", "I recently completed the 5-day, 50-mile pack back trip called the Rocky Mountain Marathon with the group called Voice of Wilderness and knew I need new boots for the trip. After reading many reviews, I decided on these. I was not disappointed. When I pulled them out of the box and put them on for the first time, they felt like I had worn them for years.Glad I went up a half size from my usual shoe size. During the trip, up hill, down hill, through brush, over rocks, crossing shallow streams - my feet stayed dry, blister-free, and secure footing all the way. I look forward to putting many more miles on these amazing boots.", "I need the wide foot bed of Salomon shoes, so they definitely live up to the size and fit of their other boots. However, I found these to fit a little differently in the heel, it was harder to lock down my heel than in the previous 3D version I've hiked with for years. Also, the upper is stiff compared to their other models; I've got about a hundred miles of hiking on these, and it still feels like my ankle is fighting for proper movement. Buy them for a great, tough, lightweight and waterproof boot. Leave them if you're already prone to heel blisters.", "I'm an avid adventurer with many years experience, also wear work boots for my daily job. I've owned multiple $400 and even $500 pairs of boots and I can't say enough good things about these boots. They are the most comfortable pair of boots I've ever tried on. I can't believe the price! I showed up to climb Mt. Adams last month with several others and what a coincidence we ALL had the same pair of boots! Not planned! There's a reason", "Hands down the most excellent footwear I have ever worn. I wear them everyday and they always make my feet happy. I had a 10 mile hike in gold country the day after I received them and was a bit worried about the breaking in period all other boots I have owned needed before they became comfortable.No breaking in period. They are masterfully designed These boots are awesome from the start. They are worth the money. I will buy another pair if these ever wear out.", "I've put these boots through the ringer here in Colorado! I climb weekly. They've seen a full year of climbing/hiking/mountaineering abuse. In fact, I've foot planted into multiple streams and pulled away with minimal water damage. The lacing system is brilliant and they're comfortable right out of the box. The toe box is wide and allows comfort for people with hobbit feet! =P I just recently bought another pair as a backup because prices were unbeatable. Man, these boots rock literally!", "Outstanding quality and fit. We didn't even have to break these in before we took them on a 100 mile, 2 week backpack trip in the mountains. Climbed several peaks and hiked over every type of terrain. Not a single hot spot or blister (paired with hiking socks and liners). These felt a little bigger and a bit more clunky than the Vasque's our other family members had (which were also fantastic boots!). but it was clear these were excellent quality and the design was cooler than the Vasque's. I would buy these again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended.", "The seemed to be really decent boots for the most part, unfortunately they kind of pinched on the outside of my feet behind the arch. The way the material was put together left a slight overlap in the inside that bothered my feet.", "Looking for a hunting boot to replace my dancer pronghorns that lasted me many years, so many they have changed pronghorn design 3 times. So my expectations are high, reading the reviews I\u2019ll keep an eye out for sole separation. Laces coming undone isn\u2019t an issue, I\u2019ll replace them or tie them in a knot like I\u2019ve done so far, comes out easily enough. Only having these boots a week, I am just now getting them broken in. Stayed dry while shoveling sidewalk and driveway of 10\u201d of snow this week, True test will be this archery elk season, we will average 12 miles a day, so I\u2019ll update after. So far very pleased.", "This is my first pair of Solomon boots for anything but skiing. Honestly, I didn't know they made non-ski boots until recently, but I am very glad that they do. These are great shoes. They fit well right out of the box. Never a blister. I walked our neighborhood streets and local trails for a week or so and they felt like I'd had them for months. The materials all appear to be very well made. Several different lacing options that also help with a custom feeling fit. I got these for a big climbing trip this summer and feel they'll be the perfect boot for that.", "Been buying these quests for years, id get 6 7 momths from them wearing and abusing them everyday. They began to suck, they started seperating from the tread, tread wore out very fast, etc towqrds the end. Then the quest 2 came out and im on my second pair and theyre back to lasting 6 months before i need to replace them. Now i love them again, excellent boots. Gtx are waterproof thats why more than the other version. Get them they rrally work when youre working in the rain.", "Love these boots so far. The fit was perfect. They are very lite and give me plenty of control when climbing. I haven't tested the water proof claim yet but will soon and report back. My only complaint is they can be hard to lace up. The third hook down from the top is slightly different than the two others and it's tough to get the lace into the hook. I've been out in pretty cold weather (15 F) with snow and my feet were toasty. I guess that's to be expected when your walking vs say sitting around. I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for lite weight winter hiking boots.", "These fit great with the standard insole however trekking long miles you need a sturdier insole. I tried several insoles so far including superfeet green and blue, SOLE but they all give me heel rub!!! I am still looking for a lower profile insole that is sturdy", "these have been awesome. Fit really well and seem durable. I have only hiked a ver times and use them as work boots mostly but these are nice hiking boots. I would buy again and may just buy a second pair exclusively for hiking Reasonable cost too - good value. I have not used these in extremely low cold temps though so cannot comment on warmth. cheers", "These are amazing boots. Very light, and durable. I wore them during a overnight hike, deep into the forest. It started raining at night and continuously downpour during the day. For the 2 might treking out, the trails we hiked in had turned into mini streams. By the time I got to the car, I was soak down to my underwear. To my surprise my Smartwool socks were about 80-85% dry due to these amazing boots. Also on a side note, I didn't get a chance to break these boots in before my hike. I didn't get any blisters nor any discomfort from wearing them them new.", "What's the \"best\" boot? The one that fits your feet! I'm constantly asked in my outdoors classes about the \"best boot,\" but there's no answer that applies to everybody. I tell my students I don't care where you buy your boots, but you'd darned well better go to a store to find the model and size that perfectly fits your individual feet. For me the perfect fit is the Quest 4d GTX. The GTX has worked very well for me, although in my experience tend to run slightly smaller than the advertised size. This is my fourth pair of the same model; when one pair wears out it's back to Amazon for another pair! Will buy again.", "Great, comfy boots! I did a fair bit of research before deciding for these. Some people complain about lackluster waterproofing or flimsy plastic hooks so time will tell (and I will update the review if any of that happens). Overall build quality seems excellent and these are unbelievable lightweight for the size. I did find that the shoelaces are particularly difficult to tie up (the knots don't like to stay together), but I may have to try other knots. The included inserts are also somewhat thin, but that doesn't seem to detract from the comfort. Finally, as with all waterproof boots, these are somewhat hot, but not unbearably so.", "I went to REI and tried these out first (heartily recommend). I bought slightly larger than I normally wear because I bought for steep ascents/descents with no trails. So far I have only worn for four days of hunting. My feet stayed dry and felt good. Only issue was when I dint notice that my laces had come loose and I turned an ankle (not too badly). Could I wear them longer? Probably, but I want to keep these in good condition because they are awesome. I have other shoes for lesser purposes.", "I can't say enough about how much I love these boots. I do a lot of backpacking and even with my 40lb pack, my feet are happy and dry no matter where I go. I haven't had any hot spots even when traveling miles uphill or downhill. I've walked through streams without a care because they have proven to be waterproof. They are an absolute joy to wear and every time I look over and see them, I want to put them on and head out into the woods; rain, snow, or sunshine. Buy these, you will not regret them one bit!", "Extremely comfy boot and well made. Been wearing in on the job site for a week now and it has been though mud and rain without breaking a sweat. I will be using this boot for double duty between work and hiking. So far it is showing great potential. If it's anything like my old Salomons I will be extremely happy. I am I size US12 and these boots do run small as they always have been made that way. I typically order a full size up to a 13 to acommodate for thick socks and extra toe room for downhill sections.", "Put 5+ miles on these at Exit Glacier near Seward, Alaska. It was a wet, rocky, muddy mess and these boots were out of the box new. Excellent support, warm (it was under 40* and raining), and I ended the excursion with no blisters. I would have stopped much sooner if I'd started having problems but these boots never made it an issue. Fit was right. I'm usually a 10 in boots and these were perfect. Very well done... I hope they hold up to Alaska.", "Wish I could order a second pair but they are gone. I\u2019ve had these for a year. First hike was a 7 mile climb up Mt LeConte. These were great. I did wear them to work for a week ahead of the hike to break in and make sure I wouldn\u2019t have any rub areas. They have performed flawlessly. Worn them to work numerous times since or anytime I will be in my feet for extended periods.", "Here is my breakdown: Out of the box I noticed the construction is amazing. I wear a size 12. They fit perfect. The lacing system is awesome. Feel very supportive around my ankles. Then there\u2019s the sole. It\u2019s like a tire tread of a rock climbing off road vehicle. They are not too heavy either. I would say all around very well built boot and very worth the money. And one more note the color scheme is very nice. My Merrill\u2019s just got officially retired.", "Most light weight secure hiker I\u2019ve had to date. Would recommend for any level of through hiking but don\u2019t think they are offered in a non-waterproof configuration as many of us prefer. I have used these boots for two years now before offering this opinion. Both in wet and rainy soft ground as well as hard ice covered rock they performed very very well. Can\u2019t go wrong with these boots I\u2019ll tear your motiv both in wet and rainy soft ground as well as hard ice covered rock they performed very very well. Can\u2019t go wrong with these boots, I love them.", "These are great boots for the price, and they are not inexpensive. Excellent ankle support, toe room is fine. You can wear single socks and stil tighten down the laces for a good secure lock on your feet, or go with liners and a second layer of socks and still feel comfortable either way. The Asolos were tempting, but these are great for now.", "Very good boot, true to size, the first open latch has small spikes that hold the laces tight while lacing the remainder of the boot, they do require more of a tug too come loose than one would expect. These are quite stiff out of the box, so they need some break-in miles. So far I have put eight miles on them, so am still adjusting to the feel of high top boots and break-in period. Have not worn high tops since boot camp 40+ years ago.", "These boots are Awesome!!!! They fit very well, very comfortable, light weight, good traction. Can't wait to hit the trails as soon as possible. These are replacing my Under Armor boots, which are good, but like most reviewers they are starting to break down on the sides of the boot. If you want very good, waterproof, hiking boots, these are the ones you want!

For many the break-in will be more than a few trips outdoors. Mine fit just barely on the large size but I have yet to wear them with wool hunting socks. When laced proper they snug up nicely, especially when a heal lock technique is used. Always afraid of twisting an ankle among the rocks, these are perfect for me. I was glad I spent a little extra coin this year, there is no doubt this boot has earned its high rating from those that put greater demand on them than I do.", "I bought these boots two weeks before hiking Mount Adams for the first time. I was only able to slightly break them in before the hike. I wore a silk sock liner and a thick boots sock. After three days of hiking and climbing to the summit of Mount Adams, I did not have a blemish on my feet! No blisters. Nice, big toe box. Great grip on snow and loose rock. Universal strap-on Crampons worked great. I bought a half size large so that I had plenty of room for socks. Great boot.", "Heavy duty and comfortable. I wear 11.5 in salomon Shoes, but need to go to 12 in these boots for my toes to feel comfortable and not crowded. I wear typical cotton Nike hiking socks with them that are not overly thick or thin but a regular athletic sock thickness. The iguana color was not too green. It has more of an olive shade to it. The laces are strong and lace snugly. After all this said, I have not worn them in the mountains yet and will update my review if anything changes.", "Salomon is really known for ski gear so I was quite surprised at how great these boots are. With the stock insoles I can walk 20 miles in a day without the balls of my feet starting to ache like they usually do. They keep water out much better than my Vasque (leather + Gore Tex) and Merrell (leather + proprietary membrane) boots. I'm planning on taking three pairs on my PCT through-hike next year.", "I have a complaint about the boot, I just use it in a passage through thick jungle, and she is not exactly waterproof, I kept both feet wet, only atravessai a very low stream that reached half the size of the shoe. It is very comfortable and resistant but not waterproof", "Great boots, great materials and confort. Excellent ankle support. They differ from the previous Quest in 3 things: The toe box is tigher than the previous model. Not so much but is noticeable. The tongue has leather on the sides instead of being all made of fabric which makes it stiffer. The design of the leather in the ankle is different but doesn\u2019t makes any difference in performance that I\u2019ve noticed. If you plan to use them on daily basis on concrete or asphalt take in mind that the sole won\u2019t last long in these surfaces.", "Performance was fantastic but the durability was pathetic. Both times I had these boots they didn't last 6 months. Its weird. Ive owned other salmon boots that where fine but for some reasons the soles on these come apart and the upper stitching always seems to wear out and eventually expose the gor-tex lining. I now own the military inspired Solomon XA Forces boot and these seem to have a far more robust design and have lasted AND performed far better than the quests 4d series.", "Salomon makes good boots. Using them for everyday as well as active wear, they provide good ankle support, the treads do a good job gripping wet ground, and they're roomy enough for thick socks. This is my third pair of Salomon hiking boots. I would absolutely buy these again.", "I decided to try this brand since I've never heard of them but read a great review by professional hiker. They fit as expected, I'm a 12 and they have room for thicker socks, like in cold weather. Still breaking them in, I have a long hike planned in June so we will see how they do on hike. I'll update my review after.", "Could not be happier with these. Have not put a lot of miles on them yet, but they are SO dang comfy and light as a feather. I paid full price on these and was actually anticipating a little bit of buyers remorse but could not be happier so far. Construction seems top notch, solid stitching and added protection in all crucial areas. Have not found out how \"waterproof\" they are, however that was not one of the factors in my purchasing decision. I will be certain to revisit and update this review if they begin showing issues, however as of now, Im one happy camper.", "I am 46 years old and have worn hiking boots my whole life. I have flat feet and because of that my ankles are full of arthritis. Because hiking boots have good ankle support, I find them more comfortable. However these Salomon Quest 4d 2 GTX backpacking boots are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. The support and cushioning in the soles is unbelievable. I can't say enough about these boots. I highly recommend these for other people like myself that have problem feet. For hiking, backpacking, or just an everyday shoe these are top notch.", "They are a well built hiker, I don't hike much anymore, but I am in construction and wear them daily in all sorts of bad weather, rock, crawlspace, etc. Wearing them every single day they last about 14 months. Great water proofing, never needed to respray them. They are light and breathable so even in the 90 degree days they wont make your feet hot unlike some leather ones. I would recommend.... and the price is way lower than they used to be (about 150-175)", "Bought these before taking a week long trip to Iceland. So much more walking than I anticipated. I prefered to wear these boots over my sneakers most of the time. The only time I wore my Vans sneakers was when we went to dinner and it seemed more appropriate. The boots fit as expected and were very comfortable. Well worth the price to me. My feet never once got sore from wearing these for 8hrs or more. Build quality is very very good in my opinion. After a week of trekking through Iceland and all it's volcanic rocks and dirt etc, these shoes look just as good as the day I bought them. Extremely happy with them.", "I have only worn them for a few months but one of the seams is already coming apart. Other than that they are good boots, but it is very disappointing to see something so expensive already falling apart after less than 100 miles of hiking.", "Super awesome shoes. Wore all around Whistler in the rain and snow and stayed dry. Super comfy. Break-in in about three steps. These are warm boots. Don't expect to wear them in the summer. For winter down into the teens and twentys your feet will stay cozy warm and dry. The shoelaces never stay tied so I highly recommend using a spring loaded device shown in my picture to replace the first knot. After that they never come untied. Don't even have to pull the bow tie tight.", "So far these are terrific! Fit is right on. I have somewhat flat feet and I typically use an orthodic insert in my boots and shoes, but these boots provide great arch support and so far I've been wearing comfortably with no insert! \"Lock\" lacing eyelet at mid-boot helps me stay dialed-in. Salomon got it right with this boot. The laces don't always want to stay tied, but I resolved that with a simple double knot. I also love the look!", "I highly recommend these hikers. I tried these as well as a pair of Kenetrek Bridger Ridge Mid's on a recent Colorado elk hunting trip, and the Salomon's are far superior. The support and traction are perfect for walking across rocks and on steep slopes. The waterproofing membrane functioned perfectly (I stood up to my ankles in a fast-moving creek for several minutes to test this). After several days in very rugged country (Maroon Bells - Snowmass) there are absolutely no sighs of wear. They are a little expensive, but you won't be disappointed. I have no doubt that these will last and perform for many years.", "These are my daily boots and have a great deal of miles on them in mixed terrain. They have never failed me in any way and the wear is progressing slowly. The main points that set this boot aside from others are how supportive they are even for their lightweight, you can wear them in summer with light socks or in winter with heavier socks and the fit will remain perfect. The pair i received is very waterproof and I have never felt a trickle of water permeate through even with extended use. In addition, straight out of the box they require very little break in time with the right sock combo.", "Very comfortable, secure footing and lots of ankle support. Just got these earlier in the week and took my first hike up Dinosaur Ridge in the mud, snow, ice and rocks. The boots fit very well and the performance was superb, they almost seemed broken in already on the first hike. I would recommend these boots for anyone who likes comfort, lightweight and great ankle support from hiking boots. My only complaint is that they came with 80\" laces which are way to long. I purchased 60\" laces that are perfect for the boot size I purchased.", "I followed the sizing chart given here, & these fit my husband perfectly! The quality seems stellar, he has worn them on one week-long hiking trip as well as a few day hikes & they wear well. He recommends breaking them in before a big hiking trip! The ortho soles may not be for you, though they are highly rated. I think these will last him a very long time, excellent quality.", "These have to be some of the best boots I have ever owned. Worked flawlessly on my hike through \"The Narrows\" in Zion National Park, UT. If you didn't know \"The Narrows\" hike is basically walking through a river for approx 5 miles. I use them for work as well at the race track, no steel toe like I normally purchase, but the toes is plenty hard if that is what you need. Saved my toes plenty of times from unwieldy horses.", "For anyone who really loves to hike...I'm not talking to you all who go for a walk in the woods and call it a hike....these are excellent! They are more lightweight than I expected, yet they feel firm and really protect my feet. After searching all over the internets for reviews of these, I couldn't find anything bad written up about them. Quite the opposite actually. Well worth it.", "Absolutely the best boots I have ever owned. I wear them to work 5 days a week and have been wearing them for over a year now and they are still in great shape, They are very comfortable also! I also hike in them occasionally and they work great for that also. I can't say enough good things about these. I have several other brands of high end boots and these are by far the best of the bunch!", "I bought these after watching a Youtube review video by Living Survival. From walking through snow, to walking in 65 degree weather on pavement or in the mud and water, these boots are fantastic. I went on a walk just like that today (part woods trail through mud and water, part pavement), and these felt amazing. My feet got a bit hot at the end of my walk, but the rest of me was hot too! When I got home I ran the under the hose to get rid of the mud, and they were good as new. I would absolutely buy these again. Well done Salomon!", "I wore these boots straight out of the box on a 10 mile rt-2500 vert. hike. I did get a few minor blisters wearing a thin merino wool sock. I had several small stream crossings, loose shale, rockhopping, and steep downhills on decomposed granite and the boots performed flawlessly. I have since wore these boots on several day hikes to backpacking with heavy loads and the boots are just awesome! I would definitely recommend these boots for a great hiking-backpacking boot. I purchesed these boots for 150 on amazon after reading the review on outdoorgearlab.", "I might not look for footware anywhere else except Salomon. Their quality is always exceptional and the fit is superb. These boots initially felt too big but with them laced up my foot was held very securely. I loosened the laces and tried to push my foot up to the toe to see how much room their was, and almost instantly had jammed my foot to the end of the shoe. It's just a different feeling like you've got too much space in your shoe, but in fact it's just right. Love these boots", "I require custom rigid orthotics, and bought these an estimated 1/3 size larger than normal. Fit with the othrotics installed is very good. Boots are stable, solid ankle support, lightweight and give good traction in the loose sand over hardpack and rock I hike in here. Too early to comment on durability, but they appear as durable as any of the synthetic lightweight boots I've used. Laces are a bit slick and required tightening every hour or so, but I expect they'll soften with use and hold a knot well. As comfortable as my worn out Lowas, which I never expected again.", "so I've been wearing these everyday for a little over a week now and I still can not get over how lite weight they are. I was looking for a boot that I could alternate with my 5.11's out here in the harsh Arizona badlands. These are quickly becoming one of my favorite pair of shoes, and I'm still breaking them in so I'm sure they will only get better. They have already proven to be extremely comfortable and durable.", "Very high quality. I wore the last pair of this model until the sole literally fell off. This was after two and a half years of almost constant, hard use. I intend to wear these until they fall apart as well. I run, weightlift and hike under a moderately heavy load with these boots in comfort. Very good value for the money.", "So far so good.. I've done a 3 or 4 day hikes with these. They have held up to rock, wet grass, muddy trails, and boggy stream bottoms. They didn't take too long to break in, and were pretty comfortable right out of the box. At first I had them laced up too tight which fatigued my feet, but after breaking in and loosening they fit perfectly. The shoe laces could be just a tad longer. I like how the rubber extends all the way over the toe, this should make them last much longer and keep rubber from separating like I have had happen on other hiking shoes.", "I gave these a four due to the fit. I tried all sorts of tricks to make them work out, but they had to be returned. They run on the narrow side, the right foot fit perfect, and the left foot just could not get comfortable. I would have given them a five, if my foot was the problem, but it was the outer side seam in the shoe. Even with two pairs of socks it was still prominant, and quite irritating. I ended up purchasing a pair of Renegade Lowa boots; I am quite pleased with those, but if ths Solomons fit properly they would have been my first choice.", "Fantastic fit! These are some of the most comfortable hikers I've ever tried on. They are still very new as of this writing, but it seems like they will break in and soften up where the foot naturally flexes, but even without being broken in they are extremely comfortable. Also much lighter than I would have guessed from their appearance. Easily can be worn all day and for extended periods. Great support inside with the specialized insole and molds very well to the foot, especially the heel area. There is no slipping and they feel very much like a glove. I highly recommend these!", "Awesome boot. Fits great and comfortable right out of the box. I've been struggling to find a hunting and hiking boot that fits well, has good support, is comfortable, affordable, and durable. I think this is the boot, although durability will be assessed over time. Laces are slick enough that you have to double knot, but you can cynch the boots tight. I usually wear an 11-11.5. I purchased an 11.5 so I could wear a thicker sock in cold weather. I think the size will work perfect.", "I was pessimistic about trying to comfortably fit in another pair of new boots but these Salomon\u2019s gave me a surprise. Best and most comfortable boots I have ever tried to wear. I am glad I gave them a try. Update- Jan 9, 2018 I wore these boots for a grueling 21 mile hike at the Grand Canyon. My feet did not have any problems while wearing theseboots. Outstanding comfort! Thanks, Brian", "THESE BOOTS ARE GREAT. Bought them for my husband who is incredibly rough on his boots and he loves them. Theyre solid, theyre comfortable, theyre water resistant and really tough. He submerged his foot in a river up to his ankle and stayed completely dry. The fit is nice even on his wide feet and the break in period isnt that bad at all. The only complaint we could think of was the laces are very long, but thats hardly a problem.", "Hands down the best hiking shoes I have bought my husband. Perfect support on the ankles, waterproof as best as can be and the newer version has a better grip on lose rock. This is his second pair and his last pair lasted over 200 miles of hiking including half dome, rim to rim, and all mighty 5 parks in utah", "LOVE these boots! I was somewhat skeptical of the overwhelmingly positive reviews... but, after a couple of backpacking trips, I can assure you that these are the real deal! I can see myself getting years of use out of these Salomons, just as I have with their previous products. At this price point, you can't buy a better pair of backpacking boots!", "Out of the box comfort was great. Only had a chance to walk in them for a couple of hours before heading off the Wonderland Trail for 4 days of strenuous hiking. For the first three days all was terrific. The fourth day was about 11 miles and by the end of the day with significant down hill, my middle toes were sore. They may be just 1/2 size too small, but the good does not come in any sizes larger than 14 so I may have an issue here.", "Some of the best boots I've ever worn, and I spent years in military combat arms and several years working in Afghanistan. I bought these boots to wear to an extremely demanding sniper school in Arizona, and they were amazing! It was incredibly hot with sharp, rocky terrain and huge cactus and the boots held up to everything. On top of it my feet felt great at the end of some very long, demanding days.", "Best Hiking Boots I have ever purchased... The support and comfort levels are like nothing I have felt before!! Why has it taken me SO long to try these Salomons... Ended up buying some Active Trail Runner/Hiking Salomons too, just based on the performance of these boots!! Never one regret!! Got a great purchase price on them, they look great, and the performance and comfort levels are second to none - in my opinion!!", "Incredibly comfortable boot that keeps out the elements and is not too hot. Great stability and fully waterproof. Only big complaint is that one of the metallic clips used to hold the laces in place snapped/broke without any obvious hits or abuse. Pretty surprising when I noticed it midway through a backpacking trip. Not debilitating and still functional but definitely annoying as I'd hoped these boots would last me years.", "Been using the boots on reserve duty for around 4-5 years now. The boots been through much, but still going strong. Total weight with gear is around 265 pounds and so far so good. They provide a perfect balance of durability, comfort, warmth in cold weather, toe and ankle protection, breathability, and stability. Add a pair of decent socks and you ended blisters. Plus they don't slip when going down on wet and slippery slopes. That contradicted every instinct I had, almost like a spider-mountain-goat or something.", "These boots are great! I've hiked in them in several different types of terrain, cold and hot, wet and dry, and have not been disappointed in the least. They provide great ankle support, are seemingly completely waterproof (yet not too hot), and are really comfortable. They are also great for city streets. All in all, highly recommended.", "If I could give these six stars I would. The fit is exactly as expected. As soon as I put them on they felt broken in and not stiff at all. I took them out hiking and fishing all day and my feet never got tired. They are truly waterproof to the ankle and very well made. The fit of the boot is narrow so if you have wider feet I would maybe consider another option but otherwise these are amazing. When these boots wear out I will be purchasing again from Salomon.", "Probably the best boots I have ever owned. I've these boots since December 2017, and have been in love! They have been used on Mountain Hiking in West Texas, looking for snakes through swamps, and through the Mayan Mountains in Belize for the past 3 months. Very comfortable and durable. They are waterproof up to the top of the boot. The only downside is that if they do get wet inside it can take some time to dry out. Other than that I have 0 complaints.", "I placed my order a week before my scheduled hike. though it was expected to be delivered within 2 days, it arrived one day before the day of the hike. If not, i may have dropped a 5 star review. the shoes fitted perfectly, so i am glad i made the right choice of the size. Infact before placing the order, i had tried out various sizes in store, to determine the right fit. It was my first hike, and the shoes served the purpose perfectly. It held my ankle very well throughout the 6 yr hike. The laces kept loosening , but apart from that i think i landed a fantastic purchase.", "I love everything about these boots except they do not fit my type of foot. I need a narrower\u200b heel with a wide to box. I found these to be wide throughout. A better fit for a narrower heel was a Vasque boot. The features of these boots were everything that I wanted. I was very disappointed I couldn't keep them. If you have feet on the wider side both in the heel and toe try these!", "My husband LOVED these boots. They were comfortable and he really liked the style. BUT (and this is a big but) they were not wide enough for his feet. These would have been the perfect boots if they came in wide. We knew when we bought that they weren't wides but decided to give it a try. Disappointed that he couldn't keep them; we ended up returning for a different brand that offered a wide boot. We would still highly recommend this boot and brand to everyone!", "I am of a size 7.5 so bought a size 8 and the boot fits comfortable and snug. There is enough toe space in front and a finger space at the back when wore with hiking socks. However, I noticed that the seam along the side of the right boot is not adhered or glued properly, resulting in a gap opening up. This will eventually lead to water seeping into the boot or the sole detaching from the boot as you can see from the picture. Pity. This shoe will have been a keeper if not for the build quality.", "Comfortable boots, unfortunately not waterproof at all and my feet were soaked after an early season hike through some snow section. Tested again at home submerged in 1.5\" of water for 30min and water came in through the sides and soaked the footbed. Will have to warranty boots to see if issue is resolved. I'd recommend testing out the waterproofing before going on a long multi day hike.", "I've been a high end boot guy for 30 years. These are the best boots I've ever worn. Have three pair. Danner is going to have to come up with something unbelievable to keep up.", "We JUST purchased these from a local, specialty store -- for $100 more than what we paid here. We have purchased the additional pair, to put away. These are absolutely awesome boots. Comfortable right out of the box. We have moved up and on from the Merrills that we have had for 5+ years. We are heavy day-hikers and about to put them to the test.", "These books are amazing. I was very skeptical at first to buy books without trying them on, but they are the best boots I have ever had. They have a stupid amount of stability and grip. And are rreeeeeaalllyyyyy comfortable. I have tried to make them slide will hiking. That's a no go, they stick to everything.", "These boots are great. Very comfortable, and require very little breaking in. I wear an 11 1/2, and had to send them back for 12's. My toes were hitting the end of the toe box. Any other boots, I am an 11 1/2. Additionaly, they are difficult to find aftermarket insoles to fit due to the built in high arch. I have tried superfeet, sofsol, and many others. None will work well ad most have arch support. Combine the insole arch support with the shoes arch support and it it too much. Even lower arch support insoles don't work very well.", "Great boot at a very good price. I have narrow feet and this fits me well. Beware if you're on the wider range of the spectrum or buy a half size larger. I like the bucket construction that will keep my feet dry if I step in a deep puddle. The mesh on top is nice for keeping feet cool but also means in winter they're not as warm. It's a trade off I gladly accept. I snow shoe a lot and works great in a snow shoe too!", "This boot is excellent for urban hiking. I have been buying them 2 pair at a time to keep each walk fresh. I have noticed that no two pair is exactly alike but that is not bad. Enjoy your Solomon Men's Quest 4D 2 GTX. One Love", "These are great boots. We are going on a seven-day hike in Ireland in a month and I will be wearing these most of the time. I have only worn the boots for three hours at a time. I had no problem with them. So I assume I could wear them all day. I use shoe inserts, so I can't really address arch support. These give me plenty of toe room and the boot is easily tightened or loosened across the middle to give the comfort and support you want.", "I recently purchased this boot after reading the review on outdoorgearlab.com as it matched exactly what I was looking for. It does run small so I had to go a full size up from 9.5 to 10.5 and boots fit amazing with a medium weight Darn Tough wool hiking sock. Completed a 9 mile winter hike in 20 degree weather and my feet never got cold however they were so warm I did sweat a little. I would recommend gaiters for deeper conditions as there is a lot of mesh to trap snow. The boot is super supportive and functions well with microspikes/ snowshoes. All around amazing boots and were good to go right out of the box.", "Note: any shoe you order from Salomon brand....be SURE to order a half-size smaller than you normally wear in other brands. Since learning this trick to ordering Salomons.....we've had no problems. Quite possibly the best brand of shoes we've found. Fit perfectly right out of the box, no break-in period. These are extremely water=proof!", "These are by far the best boots I\u2019ve ever owned. They\u2019re not too hot in the summer, and keep my feet warm trudging through snow. They give great ankle support, and breaking in was a breeze. They\u2019ve been used pretty heavily this year, and they remain in great shape. Once they do wear out I\u2019ll absolutely buy these again.", "This is the best backpacking/trekking boot I've ever worn. If you are trekking through mountain terrain or wet/muddy terrain these are insanely good. I just finished a 150 mile trek in the Scottish highlands where it rained everyday; my feet never got wet. I was also trekking through 5-6 inch mud at times with no impact to water resistance performance. They don't breath well so I wouldn't recommend them for dry, hot weather. These boots offered great support and with my merino wool trekking socks I had no blisters. I highly highly recommend this product.", "Very well made boots that do a great job of providing ankle support. They've also proven to be waterproof when used in deep snow and walking through shallow water. I've had them a few months and they're still pretty stiff, though, so keep that in mind if you're thinking about using them right away for a big hike. The break-in period is probably a little longer than most similar boots. The fit is perfect and the size is accurate.", "Great boots at an awesome price! After reading the reviews I was prepared to buy these boots for $100 more than I ended up paying. I've had great experiences with Salomon in the past and it looks like this will be more of the same. I gambled and ordered my usual boot size and these fit perfectly (true to size). They feel great right out of the box and I've been wearing them all day every day comfortably. I'm tempted to buy another pair and store them until these wear out!", "Perfect right out of the box. Almost zero break-in. Unbelievably light weight and amazing support. I do a lot of backpacking. I switched over to trail runners a few years ago because of the weight issues with bigger boots. Well that all came to an end when I rolled my ankle out on the trail a few months back. These give you the support you need for a multi day trip without sacrificing lightweight footwear. Five stars all the way around. I will be buying another pair when these wear out.", "These boots are my favorite brand and style and I would normally rate them a 5. I expected a new pair of boots. This particular pair came in a plain Brown box and didn't have the usual tags that accompany Salomon boots. Closer inspection shows the boots had been worn and actually had dirt still in the lugs of the sole. Luckily the price was low enough to where I will keep this pair for backup.", "I was born with boots on and probably die with them on, and these are the best fitting boot ever. But, there is an issue with the sole separating in tiny edge areas. Everyone who buys boots whould buy Boot-Fix Shoe Glue: Instant Professional Grade Shoe Repair Glue .", "They fit good and stiff. I've never owned a pair of hiking boots before so my experience is very little. They appear to be well made and very sturdy. Look forward to putting them into good use. UPDATE: I've had these boots for about a month and they broke in quickly and wear like tennis shoes. They wear snug around the ankles and are very warm. I truly enjoy them and very pleased with the decision to purchase them.", "Great shoe! came on time, and is a gfit for my husband. He loves it! Said it is well made and comfortable and he cant wait to hit the trails. Since he is pretty picky, I have to say this is a great price for a really good shoe. It probably runs a little wide since the D fits his foot. He normally looks for a 4E dress shoe.", "These are the best backpacking boots I ever owned. It provides excellent support and do the least beating to my feet on rugged trails. My son wears the same boots and none of us had blisters even in the first hike. They are very smooth inside, so even if foot slides it remains protected. I wear boots with orange superfeet liners to make get more arch support and more cusion at the toes. The boots are wide and stable, do not roll on the heel by design. Very easy to lace. The amazon price of $160 and 2 days delivery was great!", "I jumped over to Salomon from Merrell and I LOVE these boots. I hike several miles a week and the support I get from these boots is awesome. Great water resistance. I also use an orthotic insert so I can't speak to the supportive with the manufacturers foot bed, but with their footbed removed and my orthotic inserted they're great! Highly Recommended!", "My first break-in trip with these was a 6 mile backpacking trip. My feet felt great and no hot spots or blisters. My second outing was a 45 mile backpacking trip with a 45 lbs backpack - still no hotspots or blisters. These boots exceeded my expectations. They feel like a running shoe, but are designed to perform over some rugged terrain. For lighter packs I wouldn't change a thing about these boots. For longer trips with heavier packs I might consider adding the Green Superfeet insoles, but that is only for a bit more comfort on my heals.", "Excellent boot. I wear it to work every day. On my feet a lot at work so I have a lot of experience with work/hiking boots. These are probably one of the top boots I have ever owned. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good solid work or hiking boot.", "I have owned the Salomon 4D GTX boots prior to buying these boots. Those boots were amazing! Hiked and climbed all over the USA no problem. Those boots needed to be 1/2 size larger to fit my feet. These 4D 2s are true to size, no need to order up a half size. They fit as well as the 4 D GTXs and seem to have the same features and support that I require for hiking, climbing, and trail work. I would highly suggest these boots to anyone who needs a great, dependable, waterproof boot.", "Just got these after 18 days but besides shipping problems the boots themselves are as advertised! Just put em on with no socks & can tell they feel good after running around the house in them. Gonna throw on some socks & break them in. Will update if any problems occur but I doubt it! LOVE the light weight & fit so far!!!", "So fare I've only had these boots a day I will update the review in a few months but as of now they are great !!! They feel great on my feet and are easy to lace there roomy in the tow box and fit perfect they also feel very durable and have a very nice construction they are great to walk in and I haven't even broken them in yet so fare I love these boots !", "I was hoping these would be a comfortable as my Lowa Caminos, they are not. I did install new insoles, as a always do in every shoe. This did help, but still not 100%. I think that the foot bed is just built stiff. Seems to be very well put together, and look good also. This is a everyday shoe for me, these have not gone off-roading as of yet. Feels like like they will be good in my rocky terrain of the Northeast. One thing I do love about the 4D,s is that there is No squeaky feet on wet tile floors. Hope this helps, the Quest is a very solid mid weight boot.", "Awesome hiking boot. I did a lot of research on hiking boots and tried several brands before making my purchase. I am happy with the boots. They take a little time to break in.. but are very comfortable. The boots are lightweight and well constructed. The boots do run a little on the small and narrow side. I would recommend buying a half size larger than your regular boot size.", "I was eyeballing these for a couple of months and was finally enticed to buy them. They are amazingly light but supportive at the same time; it is like walking on air. I can now \"jump higher\", \"leap further\", and \"run faster\" :-D. The most comfortable boots I have ever worn and out of the box. There is a definite Wow effect to wearing these.", "These boots are rugged, well built and use new lacing tech to keep laces locked in the right amount of tension. First season in Colorado high country, all I could expect. Season #2: still holding up to the rocky Colorado trails around Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, and other neighboring areas. Only 1 blister this year, resulting from too thick sock choice and too tight lacings.", "I am a member of the Kauai K9 Search and Rescue team and put these boots through some crazy tropical rainforest conditions. I\u2019ve owned many different types of boots and these are the best boots I have ever owned. They take some time to break in but once they get broken in they are super comfortable. I have a weak ankle and roll it often. I am on my second pair and have never rolled my ankle wearing these boots. The ankle support is great. My only complaint is once they get stinky the smell never goes away.", "My son went to REI to try these shoes on to get a better feel and figure out sizing (highly recommend). We recently went to Scotland and went hiking there and it kept his feet completely dry and he didn't complain about it hurting his feet at all. There was hardly any break-in time and you can tell it's a great quality hiking book. He loved it so much that he convinced his sister to get a pair, too! The cost of the shoes was a lot cheaper on Amazon and so we purchased them here. It's been a couple of months and he's had no issues with them.", "Purchased this boot over a month ago. Fits nice seems true to size. I like the lacing and doesn\u2019t come untied like most of the other boots I have worn. Pretty comfortable. They feel durable. Haven\u2019t went on any hikes with them yet. But will when spring gets here.", "These boots are amazing. I finally got to wear them all day for a Zip lining/hiking adventure here in Oregon. Fit my narrow feet perfectly and even with my high arches, I did not need my additional supports. Wish I had bought them many years ago and they are worth every penny. No break in required and definitely get yourself a good set of Wool socks too. I don't know why I didn't do this for hunting a long time ago.", "I bought these in December wanting to break them in prior to hiking Mt. K in late February/early March. I feel like there was virtually no \"break-in\" time, right out of the box these have been comfortable to wear. These handle the cold very well (used them while shoveling snow in Utah, ~10\u00b0 F) and my toes got cold after a couple hours. Granted, I'd put the blame on old socks rather than these boots. I've taken them on a few practice hikes, as well as using them on the treadmill/stair-master, and they breathe really well. I'll update this review again after summiting Mt. Kilimanjaro.", "Took a little while to get broken in, but overall these are great and seem like they will hold up well. Great stiffness and stability for rough terrain. I don't go hiking often, but when I do there are usually a lot of rocks and obstacles, so I want footwear that is designed for the task, This boot is it!", "Fit about a quarter size small I am between a 11 and 11.5. I can wear 11's in most boots these were just a touch too small fit more like a tennis shoe. Perfect boot for light hikes on established trails looked a little flimsy to carry a pack and trek through the wilderness areas though, which is what I was looking for.", "Fits like a Solomon Boot, probably my fault that it's too high. I had the Quest 3D previously, which had one less speed lace eyelet. These were a bit taller but more tall than I expected. These are not a casual boot. I like the boot but I still wish they had full leather uppers instead of the nylon/suede pattern. I haven't worn them enough to see how they will wear but from my experience, more seams = more problems. We shall see.", "Just got them and we'll see how they stand up to a Wisconsin winter, but spent a whole day in them doing a lot of walking and they were very comfortable. I had wool socks on and even though not insulated, they were nice and warm. These are \"substantial\" boots - big and solid. Great lacing system.", "Took these on my first five mile hike today. I can already tell they are a lot better for long hiking than my Bates boots were. They are sturdy and well made and kept my feet warm and dry as today the trail had lots of mud and snow. They also offer excellent ankle support. A lot of the field searchers in my SAR unit wear these and now I understand why. Great product and a great investment.", "I purchased these boots for a trip to the middle east which included a good deal of hiking on rocky terrain in Jordan and Morocco. I needed something with good support that I could wear all day in a hot environment. These boots performed well beyond my expectations. Hiking all day in the Atlas mountains on steep, loose gravel slopes was a joy. These boots provided great support, all day comfort, and the sure footed traction a large guy like me needed to feel confident in that environment. Even the heat didn't pose a problem as the boots somehow provided enough air circulation to keep my feet dry and comfortable. I can recommend these boots unequivocally.", "These boots fit me perfectly -- I am a size 12, and they are very well constructed and designed. Use these year-round and so far haven't had a problem with them. Easy to clean and feel comfortable.", "These are the best hiking boots I've ever owned. Fit, comfort, and support. Not for extreme mountaineering, not for snow. These are my second pair. I've worn them 12 + hour work days, walking on concrete, and climbing ladders, with comfort and support. I highly recommend these boots. Well worth the money.", "I'm on my third pair of Salomon quest 4D 2 GTX boots. They are the best boot available at this price point in my opinion($130). I put over 400 miles hiking/hunting this past year with a 30-50lb backpack on most of the time and they are still holding up strong. I am also very pleased with how waterproof they have been, even wear them in snow with gaiters and I've never had wet or cold feet. I will definitely keep buying these boots if amazon keeps the pricing right.", "These boots rock!! Have now used them a few times on a couple backpacking trips. Comfortable, great traction, good support, not heavy, WATERPROOF. I would highly recommend!", "Ordered it for my husband who loves hiking. He's tried other brands and states this is the best one from day one. He usually walks around 4-5 continuous hours during Sundays and love them! He even wore them to fly from the US to Central America for about 10 hours and were great. Not sure how long would they last but so far they've been comfortable and performed as expected.", "I got these and did only 10 miles or so of break-in before taking them on 100 mile 5 night trip in Montana. Normally I have issues with blisters but non with these ( I went 1/2 size up). I carried a 35lb pack up and down mountains and my feet felt great. Only things I would recommend is don't lace the wide rivets unless you are going slow, I hike fast and found these to pinch my feet when in a fast stride. I will be buying these again", "These boots for as expected but were much more stiff and difficult to break in than expected. I had expected these boots to be more comfortable and wearable out of the box like other hiking boots such as the Merill Moab hiking shoes that I love. These Salamokn boots should and could be a five star product with a bit more care to provide boots that are a bit softer and immediately wearable.", "I found a place that sells these. So I made sure the size I needed would be correct then ordered them from here at Amazon. I paid for the next day shipping and as promised they arrived the next afternoon. These are amazing boots, they fit perfectly and need no breaking time. Plus the price is completely better than retail. Just use the retailers to find what you want then order what you need. Amazon is awesome. Thank you.", "I bought these from recommendations online and product reviews. I have not gone on the trials with them and am still breaking them in. However the fit is amazing. These boots are spot on. The ankles are somewhat stiff and offer good protection. They do require breaking, but I expected that.", "I bought these for my son and he said they felt great . Many reviews suggested that that you buy a half size larger than usual. I did not do that. I bought his usual size and they fit perfectly.", "I fell some 40+ feet down the side of a mountain, and I believe the support of these boots kept my left ankle from snapping. These boots are comfortable, water-resistant, and saved my ass one day when I least expected it. The laces are a bit difficult to get a secure tightening, but overall I really couldn't recommend them more strongly.", "I really like the shoes but they are very narrow shoes. The length of the shoe is just fine but they didn't offer a wider version. Because of this I have to wear the laces more loose than I normally do. I'd give 5 stars if they offered a wider sole version.", "Havent got a chance to truly test these yet. I did take them on a 14.5 mile hike on the first time out and trail was wet from several days of previous rain. No water, seemed to breath well, no blisters. Fit was nice, and lacing cinches up quick and tight and boots have plenty of ankle support. I would find it to believe that some could seriously role their ankle while wearing these boots.", "These boots are poorly made. I only used these boots for some moderate hiking and still had problems with the boots The Upper Collar ripped with I was taking the boots off. Two of the eyelets broke off. The positives are they are lightweight and comfortable I will try another brand before I ever reorder these boots", "Fantastic boot. Rock solid support around ankles and arch. Good toe protection from stumps, rocks, etc. Lacing mechanism is top quality. The laces should either be waxed or customers need to make sure and double knot them in order to keep them from slipping free. I used these on a technical trail (lots of loose rocky surfaces and large root systems) and my feet didn't feel tired at all after a faced paced hour long hike.", "Have hiked 56 miles in these so far. I really like them. A quality boot. Really nice ankle support for heavy pack (I'm 230 ...+ 47lb pack. Great ankle protection too around rocky terrain. Next up....78 mile Philmont hike", "Great boot! Was not sure of what size to buy and went with my gut feeling and picked up a size 10US, feels great! Needs a bit breaking into but no hot spots as of yet.. For comparison, my other hiking boot is a Hi-Tec in a size 10US also.", "Fantastic boot. Well done Salomon! I recently purchased these and put about 30 miles on them before a Grand Canyon backpacking trip. I really couldn't ask for more. I would have given 5 stars but my only two small issues is, they are warm, and you have to double knot the laces. Living in Arizona is the problem with them being too warm and not really the boots fault. The double knot thing isn't that much of a concern for me. Overall a really great boot and chances are I will buy them again once these wear out.", "Everything they say about this shoe is 150% true. Out of the box, great fit, comfort, flexibility and support where it counts. I hike in the snow and rain, on Rocky Mountain mountains and trails (with bad knees and ankles) and these shoes are a dream and such a great value for my money. Researched the hell out of hiking boots and these come out on top in every category. You should stop your search now and just buy these shoes!", "Hiking with these even on rough rocky trails was great. Really no problems with them at all. I didn't even have blisters the first use like most boots. Highly recommend.", "These boots are top notch. I am working on my second pair and wear them daily to work as well as backpacking trips. They are sturdy like a backpacking boot but wear like a light day hiker. Zero to no break in time. Pulled these out of the box and did a 17 mile weekend with no issues or hot spots. I will buy another pair for sure.", "These are very good boots; they broke in very easily and are comfortable and waterproof. I usually wear wide shoe sizes but I could not find any wide boots for hiking....but these boots fit quite well. I am quite pleased with the functionality of the boots. If paying this much, I expected a lot in return...and got it. Recommended for anyone who hikes rough terrain.", "I really like these boots. When I first put them on I thought they were pretty stiff especially the uppers. After a few days in them they are very comfortable. I think they run just a little large, but would be right with thicker socks.", "These may be the best backpacking boots I've owned. I'm finding them very comfortable with great support for those carrying packs. I haven't encountered any foot problems or sore spots. They aren't the lightest backpack boot around but they are pretty light for the support they offer. I have found the grip to be good in both wet and dry conditions, the laces are great and the waterproofing has held up so far. All around a great boot!", "My husband purchased these for a 2 week backpacking trip in the Brooks range of Alaska. He knew before going that he was going to cross 3 streams/rivers and trek through marshland. He wore them hiking for 30 hours at one point (long story) and they were wonderful. They saved him from numerous near ankle sprains, left him blister-free, and kept his feet dry when crossing water. They started getting warm around 70 degrees (the temps he dealt with during the course of his trip ranged from 50-70 degrees). As he describes them, \"they're tanks\" and he is extremely glad he purchased them for his trip and for future use.", "Great Shoes!! I have always been a Keen / Merrill guy and as of the last few years I feel those companies have gone downhill. Tried these based off the reviews here on Amazon and wow, these are built well, comfy and way nicer for not much more money. The only con i have is that the break in time is longer than normal, This is due to the stiff foot bed that in time will last long do to its design. They are getting better and more flexible every day! Would buy these again in a heartbeat.", "I finally pulled the trigger on the Salomon Quest boots. I'd been looking for a lighter more breathable alterative to my Asolos. I already own a pair of Salomon Ultra Mids so I was pretty confident that the Quest would be everything I had expected and more. Time will tell after I've had a chance to put some miles on them. I hope they live up to all of the positive reviews I've read about them. Also, thanks Amazon for saving me a significant amount over the in store retail. I'm starting to get the hang of this on-line shopping thing!", "I needed a new pair of boots overnight and these came up with high reviews. I put about 35miles on them in the first few days in the Easterern Sierras, right out of the box. I was absolutely surprised, great support with my newbie oversweight backpack, no blisters and great grip! I usually wear Asolo boots and was nervous about trying these out...So glad I did...Now I have two boot manufactures I trust!", "Bought for my husband, whom has severe over pronation and flat feet. He really pleased with them so far. (We live in the ADK mountains and work on uneven, hilly terrain.) Good support and decent breath ability, we are experiencing a warm spell, and with his mid to heavy weight sock his feet were still comfortable! Yay, he has happy feet, knees and hips now!", "Great boot! I wear them for yard work, weed eating high grass and weeds. The shoe laces are a problem! Come undone easily even when double knotted. I bought a pair for my husband he loves them for hiking fire trails with our dog. Then purchased a pair for me. Just went the normal conversion for men to women... I normally wear custom orthotics but I don't need them with these boots! Very supportive!", "good boots.The only draw back I experienced is that they where rubbing bad on my leg (like in line skates boots would do) even I was wearing thick hiking socks. After 7 days of hiking in the mountains (51 miles) I couldn't bear the pain any more so I couldn't use them later.", "I wear an 11 in nearly all my shoes. Sometimes a 10.5. The 11 is slightly short on my right foot. I have a mild case of toe bumping on a decline, even with the boots tied tight. Ordering an 11.5 Other than that, super comfy out the box, great ankle support. A little warm though.", "Best boots I've ever worn. Did 50 miles in Glacier NP brand new with no break in. Never had a hot spot or any soreness. Feet felt fresh at the end of each day (4 days) with a 45 lb pack. Very waterproof. Only way water gets in is from the top so wear gaiters if you plan on hiking in the rain for a long time. So good, I purchased a second pair in case they stop making these boots.", "I have worn the Salomon XA Pro shoes for years and they have always fit well, been comfortable, and held up over the years, which is why I decided on these boots. These boots carry on that legacy while adding excellent ankle support. I was expecting to have to break them in like all my other boots, but these were incredibly comfortable from day 1. I do wish they breathed a little better, but its a price I am willing to pay for waterproofing.", "After returning a pair of toe killing Vasque Breeze 2's, I ordered these. I did order 1/2 size up and these fit and feel great! Right out of the box, we walked several miles (in town) with zero hot spots. Big (heavy) backpacking trip coming up soon & will report back if I have any issues. Great boots so far.", "Bought them in 2015 and they are just starting to show signs of wear, I wear these regularly hiking and doing yard work, and in sloppy weather great boot still water proof !", "Haven't really tried them on a hike yet but they feel very comfortable and provide excellent ankle support. They feel like they would be excellent in rough terrain, especially if you were carrying a heavy load. I don't think they would be comfortable for everyday use in a Urban environment. Good looking boot, you'll be the best dressed hiker on the trail.", "Broke these in within a month's time and did me well in rocky mountain nat'l park for a few days. This is the kind of shoe I will make last for years to come. Durable shoe and easy to hike in, and performs especially well on uneven terrain with rocks, etc. Good heel support saved me from rolling my ankle a couple times. I like the way the laces sit in the clasps on the high top. Very comfortable and light for a hiking boot. Could basically live in these.", "I have only had them out twice. Both times they were immediately comfortable and did not seem to need a long \"break in\" period. I saw someone recommended tying the laces in a double knot because their laces loosened and came undone. I experienced this as well. A simple double knot will fix this issue.", "Amazingly light. Very comfortable. Excellent arch and ankle support. Great traction. Lace system works really well. Solid construction. Great looking boot. True to size. I usually wear 11, sometimes 10.5. 11 is perfect for this boot. Great room in the toe box. Normal to slightly narrow fit on the sides which is perfect for me. Probably not for the wide footed.", "Since I read the other views it did fit as expected and the expected fit was a bit on the narrow side. Took it on a hike the weekend I got it and expected to have to break it in somewhat, this was not needed at all and it had strong enough ankle support to protect mine after a serious spill. Ankle was sore and bruised the next day but I was back walking on it with no issues within 5 minutes. Laces are sturdy and grip was excellent.", "I was a big KEEN fan, (still am), but wanted a stiffer, taller, hiking boot I could wear for weeks if needed. This is it. I am wearing them almost every day with merino wool socks. They are very comfortable and I can walk in them on dirt, grass or concrete for hours. They are well made with quality materials, appear to be very durable, and look great too. Get your own!", "I tried many different pairs of boots to fit my slightly wider than normal feet, and these were about the best fit I could find. So it gets 4 stars for the being the best not-quite-perfect option. They have held up well so far, and definitely feel like they'll last a good long while. It's really only my right foot that doesn't fit properly, so there's pressure on the side of that foot. But my left foot feels great at the end of a hike.", "I really love these boots. They were comfortable right out of the box. They are extremely supportive and stable. The comfort level reminds me of my Merrells, but so far have been much better quality. I haven't really had them in water yet, so hopefully they will at least provide good water resistance.", "I would've absolutely given you five stars, but these are the worst shoelaces on the face of the earth! You cannot keep these tied unless you double knot them. The fit is spot on, plenty of ankle support, and plenty of cushion for a 6 foot two 290 pound man! I am taking them on a three day Swamp hike on the Palmetto trail this weekend. I will give you a better report in three days. In my opinion these are fantastic boots.", "Outstanding boot! No wonder U.S. special forces use Salomon...among others. I would say true to size, always difficult, as I wear 10 or 10.5, depending on manufacturer. Only one day wearing, but started the day off in them and hiked 5 miles, then wore around the house. Never felt uncomfortable or feeling like I needed to take to the creek and walk them dry. You won't be disappointed.", "First full day wearing them, other than around the house and to the grocery store, and they feel great so far. I had a pair of Asolo's before these and they were a great fit too and I liked them other than the sole began to peel away and the inner part where my heel sits up against began to wear away and make wearing them a little uncomfortable. I can feel these starting to break in already. A bit pricey, but time will tell if these will be my new \"go-to\" boot, so far I'm thinking YES! Btw, the fit is true to size.", "Right out of the box and onto the trail. I am quite impressed with this shoe and it's ankle support. After doing some research and speaking with a retail associate who works for a major hiking chain, I decided to give them a try. Salomon has earned my support for their product. Simply speaking, a well made hiking boot!", "Fantastic. I am 6'3\" and 265 lbs with a narrow foot and high arch. 13 d was perfect size and fit. FWIW the \"Superfeet COPPER Personalized Comfort Insoles,Copper, X-Large/F: Men's 11.5-13 M US/Women;s 12.5 - 14 M US\" Fit into this boot perfectly with no trimming. It was like it was made for this boot.", "I have a size 10 foot. I ordered a size 10 boot, fit perfectly. I love this boot. I'm old school and have always owned a leather hiking boot. I am impressed with how this boot performs. This boot is real light for all the support it gives. This boot is a Little stiff but gives great ankle support. On steep descents my toes do not cram the front of the boot. I've hiked on loose rocks, wet boulders, and gravel. This boot offers great traction. I ware a medium cushion wool sock, and my feet don't sweat hardly at all. Boot breaths well. I'm happy with this purchase.", "Nice high end boot that looked good and felt good. But too heavy for 99% of my hiking. They fit as expected and seemed well built. Make sure you really want / need the extra weight on your feet before you buy these. I didn't and returned.", "Best boots I have ever had on my feet. 55 year old former athlete, sometimes runner, consistent plantar fasciitis problems, planning a 150 mile hike across Scotland. I got these boots 3 months before big hike, within 20 miles I was convinced they were made special for me. Custom orthotics in place, my feet never hurt once in the break-in period or across the 150 mile hike. That hike, btw, filled with every obstacle you can imagine - rough, steep, mud, rain, pavement. Except snow, we saw it all. My feet were never hot, cold, or wet. Amazing boots I will recommend to everyone", "Seem very well constructed, light weight, waterproof, good ankle support, good fit. Definitely need a little break in time, but I walked them around for a week and a few short off trail hikes and now they fit like a glove. I usually go through about 1 pair of boot a year, so I'll be interested to see how these hold up. But I really like them so far.", "Worked well right out of the box. Comfy but stable. But a hassle to cinch up laces as eyelets stop too far down the shoe and laces easily become unhooked (with the upper hooking system) when attempting to put on the boot. Lacing design certainly not engineered for speed or convenience. Overall a good shoe though", "I have had the comet for 6 years and it's still going strong other than loosening its waterproofing about a year ago. I decided this time to go with the 4 D and so far not disappointed. I did order a 14. I normally wear a 13 but salomons seem to run a little small on me. The 14 fits great and they are built like a tank. If they are like my previous comets it will be a good investment.", "I've only used it twice now, but I'm super impressed with it's quality craftsmanship and durability. It's comfortable after about an hour hike on some pretty easy trails, I can't wait to truly test them out on some harder stuff. So far so good!", "Best hiking boots I found for my wide forefoot, narrow heel female feet. I use a custom orthotic as the included footbed has no arch support at all. These boots are a little narrow in the midfoot so finding the right arch support may be a little challenging, but these seem to be well made boots that I find very comfortable, and I tried on many, many pairs of boots before settling on these.", "I have owned two pairs of the previous version of Salomon Quest 4D GTX and I've put 1500 miles on the two pairs combined. When the time came to buy a new pair of boots, I decided to go with the updated model. Four days after receiving them, I took them on a 45 miles backpacking trip in Emigrant wilderness, and the boots performed very well. In fact, they feel even more comfortable than the previous model. I am pleased with these boots.", "Best boots by far. Once there broken in ....There awesome! Extremely comfortable and able to handle every terrain possible. Not to mention the Gortex which keeps water out . Able to withstand extreme temperatures down to the single digits. Not a boot to be worn in warmer weather though. Overall, Top notch quality and durability for those wilderness people out there!!", "It's the rainy season here in San Francisco and were having a record year for rainfall, but I have no concern with these rugged hiking boots. There warm and cozy and have excellent ankle support. My feet stay dry and provide the protection I need in an urban enviorment. City or country these will fit the bill.", "Awesome boots. Love the high ankle support but most importantly they support my flat feet. The only drawback I found was the laces sometimes are hard to get off the first bottom buckle. However, the laces are so strong, they are not affected by the sticking and hard pulling. I would not keep This from buying them again. I wear them hiking and as an every day boot for work.", "I bought the wrong size at REI but that was my fault for trying to get a snug fit and not paying attention to the measured size (13) I ended up having to get another pair for my long hikes and now with plenty of room in the toe box they are great for long heavy pack hikes. Great support along with Spenco total support Max insoles (sold separately) for those suffering from plantars fasciitis.", "These are just excellent boots. I have a fallen arch, so I'm very limited on footwear that is supportive enough. I have to say, for the short time I have had these, it was love at first lace. They are my everyday wear for the fall/winter, and though a bit warm on the 70+ degree days, they are perfect for the majority of the time. Built like a tank and feels like a luxury car for your feet. Excellent boot!", "I really wanted to love these, but they are simply VERY narrow. I don't have wide feet by any means, but the boots were still too narrow.", "Tried another expensive boot, Low@, couldn't stay in them but for a few hours. Feet killed me. Went to RE! and tried on the Salomon on the advice of their sales guy. Boy, did he know his stuff. He said my foot was narrow in the heel which allowed my foot to move around even though I tied the Low@'s very tight. This Salomon Quest 4D2 GTX is an excellent boot for my type of foot.", "This boot is only good for maybe 600 to 700 miles of backpacking. The sole and and rubber start to pull and disintegrate! So, the boot is comfortable, somewhat light for a above the ankle fit. So decide if your hard earned money is worth it.", "I have accumulated 5 pairs of Salomon's 4D GTX boots and they are spectacular to wear and extremely durable. Unbelievable construction! Even the shoe laces haven't even started breaking down or freying. I have 2 more pairs I have eyes on and hopefully plan to purchase by spring. A little pricey but I believe you'll be glad you went with Salomon. Even Elite Forces are now wearing them!", "Usually I take size 10, I ordered size 10.5 just in case a 10 was to small, wearing boots with a heavier sock, happy I ordered a 10.5 just for the luxury of having the extra foot space for the heavy socks. Love the boots, great price and fast and free shipping,would purchase again.", "Love them so far. Great fit, feel very sturdy and solid hiking over rough terrain and rock. Feet were perfectly dry after hiking through snow and slush. Haven't tried submerging them yet. Took 3-4 days of wearing to feel like they were broken in. Cons: Only one I have right off the bat is the eyelets lower on the shoe are plastic, so it makes me feel like they are going to break under the stresses a hiking boot takes. The eyelets the come up the ankle (last three sets) are metal, so that makes me feel good. Just nervous about the plastic ones.", "Very comfortable and stable boots with good traction and ankle support. I have not worn them long enough to tell how they will hold up, but they appear well built. One note on fitment: this is a boot you should have professionally fitted. They don't fit the way a half shank boot does and your foot needs measured to line the shank with the flex point of your foot. I ended up going up a full size and couldn't be happier.", "Did use these boots for the first time. I am sold. No problem walking for about 1.5 hours. No break in required. Great traction, great support. Made the right decision. Will see how they last, but have high hopes since they look like they are designed for a lot more abuse than they will receive from my hiking tours.", "I wear these boots all day, everyday. They are light and comfortable. This is my second pair of Salomon boots, and I plan to purchase more in the future. Highly recommended. Now I am on my third pair - the only boot I will purchase and wear from now on. I tried the Salewas but for the same price they were no where near as nice as the Salomons. Highly recommended.", "I haven't climbed any Nepalese mountains in these boots but so far, they seem to be tough and well made. They broke in quickly over the course of a few days and I now wear these all day long. I may update this after doing some hunting in the local rugged terrain.", "This is the 3rd set of these Salomons I have bought. They have saved my ankles numerous times. I climb Colorado 14ers which are nothing but rocks and boulders above 12,000 feet. A great back pack boot too! True fit and a little bigger in the toe box and snug on the ankle.", "I'm still in the break-in period and haven't hit the mountains, but in about a week I will put them to the test in the rugged mountains of Wyoming. First impression is they are a very comfortable boot, made from quality materials. I saw other reviews that they run narrow, but I have pretty heavy duty feet and they fit perfect. They do not have the stiff sole of a normal mountaineering boot, so I'm a little skeptical on how they will perform on treacherous and steep cross country hillsides, but we shall see. They feel like they will be just fine on normal hiking trails.", "Amazing boot! Day 1 and I thought I would need to break them in so I wore them all day at work. I can comfortable tell you that these boots are ready out of the box! They need next to no time to break in, and are comfortable all day. I do have insole in the boot so that does help because the ones they come with are pretty thin. But overall great deal for a great boot!", "Very well constructed and durable without a doubt. Although the Gortex is not very waterproof or insulated. Maybe me being in the military has me having high expectations for gortex but it\u2019s just my opinion.", "Husband loves them!!Comfort - fir and wear so far. Bought these boots in April 2017 this is July, The souls have come unglued separated from the boot please let me know what kind of guarantee You have. thank you jenne G", "I have another pair of Salomon boots and loved them so much I wanted another pair but a different model. These are great looking and they have a nice tread. The only con I can come up with is the break in period on Salomon boots are hellacious. Once that's over they're very nice", "Best investment for hiking ever made! I am actually doing more hiking because of these boots. feels like sneakers and it protects my super weak ankles that were cause by multiple ankle sprains. They are also water proof and my feet do not sweat like my other boots I owned to hike or just walk around at work. Highly recommend for any hiking!", "They seemed like great boots, and I've heard great things about them, but I couldn't find a pair that fit my feet. I normally wear a 10 or 10.5. With these boots, the 11.5 was crushing my toes together, but the 12 was way, way too big. The materials and construction were on point, but the sizing seems to run small and narrow. Your results may vary. I ended up having to go with a different boot.", "Another amazing Salomon product. I miss the light weights of my previous model (which I believe is no longer available), but this one seems better overall. Sturdy, more solid, and should last longer ( the previous one lasted almost 7 years !!!)", "These boots are on the narrow side, for my feet at least. Still, I've completed several local hikes, plus a gnarly one in the Canadian Rockies, and they performed great. Very light, sturdy, and good traction. No regrets about the purchase.", "These run a bit narrow for my size 12-Wide foot, so got 13, and they fit great. No break-in needed. Took them on an 11.5 mile, rocky, rooty,muddy, steep (3000 ft elevation-gain) day-hike right out of the box with a single pair of cotton crew socks....no blisters. They were a bit tight above the ankles with a tight lacing-up, so I loosened the laces a bit at the top, and they were super-comfy the rest of the way. Great grip and foot protection in pretty rough terrain. Durability remains to be seen, but I loved them on their first spin in the mountains.", "Very comfortable fit. There is a small nodule on the tongue on one of the boots (but not the other) that creates pain on top of foot if boot is tied too tight. Hopefully it will smooth out over time. Seems as though it is a stitching problem on one tongue.", "Twice a year 63 year old wilderness backpacker looking to upgrade my boots. Tested Vasque, Helly Hansen, Merrill and Oboz and chose these Salomons. All the reviews and rankings had them at or near the top and I can see why. Comfortable yet sturdy fit (after 2 day break-in), excellent stability and ankle support. Only downside is I wish they had more color options. Can't wait to do Odessa Lake in RMNP next month. BTW love using Amazon and Moosejaw to order up different brands, try them out and get totally free shipping back.", "Out of the box comfortable and fit was exactly as expected. I would have ordered a wide if it was offered but sizing up .5 a size than i normally wear seems to be working just fine. Have worn the last 3 days around the house and walking the dog with no issues. Excited to get them out on the trail in the next few weeks.", "Best boots I have ever worn. Very comfortable but wear out too fast. I was able to get 6 months out of my first pair. I contacted Salomon for the warranty and they sent me a voucher for a new pair after a few days. I gave 5 stars for my overall experience with the boots on my second pair now will follow up on how long these ones last", "Excellent lightweight, waterproof hiking boot. I used these boots for multiple-day archery hunts at the timberline in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. I have been very impress with the comfort, ankle support, and durability of these boots. I marked yes for good arch support, but that will depend on what kind of arch you have. Shoes / Boots with too much arch support cause my feet to hurt and I no issues with that at all.", "Second pair, love these boots. ACL surgery left me with arthritis in my 30s, put over a 100 miles on my first pair without complaints. There are a lot of seams to wear out, but you can't wear them out if you're not trekking along with your feet in bliss!", "Excellent product. I've worn them strictly for outdoor adventures here in the PNW. Great quality. Works well in all terrains", "These boots are awesome... extremely comfortable and way lighter than they look.... and speaking of looks... Man, are these things eye-catching. Very firm sole and very \"grippy\"... in my humble opinion, these are the best boots on the market... I did my research before buying and couldn't be more satisfied.", "My son specifically asked for these hiking boots for Christmas, after doing a lot of research and finding they were highly rated. Still, we were wary since we haven't had good luck buying shoes online. To our relief, he loves how well these boots fit! He says they feel very light, yet are sturdy and comfortably support his low arches. They are also very nice looking, especially in the Iguana green, which is what we bought. Thank you for our first successful online shoe purchase!", "At least in my experience, all boots with a Goretex lining run a bit tighter than I like. These are no exception. Once worn in, they should be fine; but may be some blisters or calluses to get there. Also, no room for heavier socks. Otherwise, great boots!", "I can't brag more about these boots. Got back from a 30 mile hike through Utah, all different terrain from sand, mud, rock and water and these boots performed flawlessly. Truly as others have said really no need to break these in. The traction in these boots are insane and you end up really relying on these boots. I'm now a Salomon customer for life.", "I have not yet actually worn these hiking boots on the trail yet, but I can share that the sizing was as expected. I checked a couple pairs of shoes I typically wear, which were both size 10 US, and ordered these hiking boots for the same size. They seem to fit fine, with a little room for thicker socks. I like the lacing and how the laces fit snugly at the clasps at the upper part of the shoe, and how efficiently they can wrap on in that section.", "I read high reviews for this boot, and having worn them over a month or so, I have to agree. Very light, very comfortable. The lacing system is first rate. The mid-ankle locking eyes really allow you to tighten up the lower laces, and still set a lighter tie on the upper ankle. The footbed is sturdy and lugs hold well", "I very rarely write reviews, but these boots are amazing. I broke them in on Cumberland Island wearing a 50 pound pack doing a total of 13 miles in them, and have used them on the AT and lots of other trails since. Never so much as a hot spot, amazing comfort when lots of other shoes make my heels hurt. Completely waterproof even walking through rushing streams. I would buy the again in a heartbeat, def a 5 star product.", "Best light weight hiking boots i have owned . I have been through Danners , Redhead, Merrell, Wolverines, etc and these offer the best ankle support and sole cushioning . They fit so good that i snagged a pair at Dicks on clearance . Look around for sales because they are kinda pricey . But, you get what you pay for . They are highly rated for a reason ,,", "I've been on 4 hikes with these boots, and thus far, they have exceeded my expectations. They are excellent boots, super comfortable for moderate-intense hiking. By far the best I've ever owned.", "I have been wearing these on and off for several days now and all though a little stiff in the beginning, they are becoming very comfortable. I recommend not just throwing them on and go hiking! So far I'm loving these boots and see why they are the best rated boots on the market.", "Backpacked through snow with these bad boys and had no issues whatsoever. I doubt they even needed to be broken in, but I wore them around work for a week before my trip. Waterproofing didn't fail, and ankle support was great without limiting movement. 100% would buy again.", "Amazing boots, comfortable from the moment I put them on. They really are that much better than say columbia's or other cheaper brands like you get at the local sporting goods store.", "Put these boots to an immediate test with a 14 mile grind through the rocky Adirondack Mt. trails with over 3,500 feet elevation gain. Didn't even have time to break them in. They performed wonderfully. We hiked in sunny dry weather, over rocky terrain, in rain, mud and slick boulders. Traction and grip were superior. Comfort was great. My toes took a pounding because of the steep decent, but don't know of a boot that would have prevented that.", "I have tried these boots at REI but they didn't have the color I liked. My actual foot size is 10.5 D. I usually wear 11.5 hiking boots to allow foot expansion. In this Quest GTX I had to go to size 12. Knowing what size fit me properly helped with the \"fit as expect\" and 5 star rating. I love these boots.", "Very good boot. It's made for hiking and that's where it should stay. Great for hiking not so much for an around the house kinda boot in my opinion. But great hiking boot.", "These boots are extremely comfortable and lightweight. I've taken them hiking a few times and they are great. The traction is better than my other hiking boots. I will use them next summer for backpacking and doing the JMT.", "Comfortable from the moment I walked in them, esp. when working on concrete floors, provided the necessary comfort. Great for 2 mile walks too.", "Great boot with real ankle support. I have had trouble with past boots not being stiff enough to hold my ankle on steep inclines. These babies are great! Love the sync-synch lace on the ankle bone as it really snugs the boot to the lower foot. Walks great. Have yet to climb in them but so far 5 star boots. it is a stiff boot out of the box. Not sure if it will soften over time. No regrets. Would buy again.", "Fit perfectly, feel comfortable and solid. I tried (in-stores) pretty much all similar offers as of autumn 2016 from North Face, Asolo, Salomon and a few more top brands - these were the winners. My hiking needs are not extreme and they'll probably last enough. I'm happy with them.", "I got these just yesterday, loved the comfort so much almost fell asleep trying them one. It has very good support around ankles which is of paramount importance to me, as I have weak right ankle, and the orthopaedic sole is great for my flat foot!", "Excellent product. Fit is awesome, keeps my feet warm at -10F as if it's 75 degrees out there, comfortable walking in for hours and hours. I would really have to dig deep to come up with a complaint about these--maybe the outsole is a bit slippery on ice? Also since the laces are really long it takes unusually long to tie 'em up? But man, who cares!", "PAIR # 3 QUEST 4D 2 GTX AND THEY LAST APPROX A YEAR , I WEAR EVERY WORK DAY 5-6 DAYS A WEEK ON CONCRETE & ON MY OFF DAYS. THEY ARE COMFORTABLE , MY FEET DO NOT SWEAT IN SUMMER OR WINTER , FEET STAY DRY ON RAINY DAYS , CAN STEP IN PUDDLES AS LONG AS ITS NOT ABOVE THE TONGUE OPENING @ ANKLE . I AM PLEASED WITH THEM", "Premature to actually rate as I haven't done any real hiking in them as I try to break them in very rugged construction. I have a wide foot so they are a little more snug than I prefer although good boots should have great suport", "I am a survival instructor in Maine and needed a boot with grip and the ablility to last. I am heavy backpacking half the year in all weather sun, snow, ice, and rain to name a few. This boot kept my feet dry and footing stable in all environments! Fantastic product I highly recommend! One thing I will note I run a little warm so in the winter if you get cold easily throw on a pair of wool socks and you will be fine!", "Super comfy, super durable, very waterproof, and well built as are all Solomon products. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good rainy/ snowy season mid-high top hiking boot.", "These are serious hiking boots, the real deal. I ordered my street shoe size, and they fit perfectly. The ankle and heel are held securely, eliminating foot movement within the boot on steep inclines or declines, but the toe box is roomy enough to let the toes do their work without constraint or blistering. The support is excellent. The sole is stiff enough to handle rocky trails. These are sturdy, comfortable boots, easily the best I have ever owned.", "Ordered two different sizes to fit my feet. Either Amazon or Salomon should offer a two-different-sized foot service. (like Nordstrom) think it would sell well. Wear about 9 1/2 on right, 10 1/2 - 11 on left.", "I have tried and tried to find a good hunting boot for my needs. I thought I would not be able to until I bought these! I am the type of hunter that puts on a lot of miles up and down the hills of eastern Washington. A short day of hunting would be 5 miles. My feet would always hurt after hunting as I was wearing inappropriate shoes for what I was doing. These are perfect! They are light, have great foot and ankle support, and just all around a good boot. I will buy these again!", "These shoes are for my son, who loves everything about them! Super comfortable and look great, too! He hasn't tried them on a hike yet, as it's been sub-zero temps. But he's been wearing them everywhere with no discomfort in \"breaking them in\".", "Heavier than anticipated and a bit stiff but they provide excellent lateral ankle support. The low back still allows for maximum heal toe movement. Haven't hade a chance to use them in any type of extreme conditions so I don't know how they'll hold up.", "Comfortable hiking boots with excellent support. Only a couple of hours to break them in. Traction on the sole has already proved useful this winter. I'm looking forward to many hikes in these boots.", "Picked these up a month ago and have logged approximately 140 miles on them. Used them on 3 15+mile hikes in rough terrain. While I'm typically not one to pay this much for shoes, I'm glad I did. They work perfect for steep ascents and descents, fit perfectly, and provide superior comfort for your feet. I've yet to get a blister and I haven't slipped once.", "A bit pricey but well worth it. Light, waterproof and stable. The first time out was on a two day hike. My right leg got a little sore at the top of the boot but During the second hike there were no soreness problems. One of those items that make you ask \"why didn't I buy these years ago?\"", "This is the third pair of this Salomon design that I have bought. I wore the first pair until they fell apart and I still wear them, they're soooo comfortable. It seems to me that the design and materials have been improved in this edition. Good support in a light boot. Good traction. A great buy when you can find them on sale as I did these.", "Fit perfect right out of the box. I'm 6'3 230 lbs and they held up without any issues. I wear a size 12 in everything from Nike to North Face. I'd say they are now my favorite pair of boots that I own. I also like the color that I purchased, the iguana. Looks great with a pair of jeans or khakis. The added Goretex is really appreciated during wet hiking. The materials used in this boot are super durable and strong. I expect these to last many years. Salomon has a 2 years replacement should they have any issues. I'm glad I purchased. Check out my YouTube channel, Justin Uriah Photo, for a video on these boots.", "Perfect! I researched and found these to be one of the best pair of hiking boots around. They are very strong, durable, very good shoe sole, and just an over all great boot. The best part is they don't weigh a ton like alot of good hiking boots do.", "Bought the same size as i wear in tennis shoes and they fit great, even had room for thicker socks if desired. They were a little bit stiff out of the box but after a couple days of wearing them they are very comfortable. I did remove the insole liner and replaced it with a Dr Scholl's insert for a little extra cushion. These are great boots and definitely offer ankle support.", "Really nice boot, but a bit too large at size 14. No 13.5 in this model. Solomon makes the Authentic in 13.5, which is very hard to find, other than directly from them.", "I am a salomon customer for years. Love the boot. Use them for hiking in Colorado 14ers and in Wyoming. Using them as my winter boot in wyoming when it gets 2+ feet of snow and -20. as long as you have the right socks these boots are fine and seem to be waterproof in the snow. Have not yet tried them in hard rain and wet grass", "Ive been looking for an everyday boot for years. These can be pricey, but there are huge variations in price depending on color scheme. I got mine for 140. They are the best boots I have ever bought bar none. I use three data points this conclusion: fit, durability and price, in that specific order. These boots are across the board 5/5. I will own a pair the rest of my life.", "Been wearing these GTX Quest hiking boots around the home since they arrived earlier this week and they are very well designed and constructed and comfortable. The foot beds are sleek and comfortable, boot seems solid and well balanced. Goretex Iguana fabric is amazing to look at very nice overall design agree with the backpacker editors this boot is to be considered. Maybe the best boot I've had the fortune to wear...", "Love these shoes. Have not tried them in a real wet environment but in dry climates these are just great\u2014Light but good for most hiking, would recommend for anything except very hardcore mountaineering.", "They are awesome and very functional but as with waterproof shoes and boots they are like a sauna. My only real complaint is that they look old a lot quicker than say a pair of Asolo Fugitives. But still a very decent boot.", "these were too small for me. They are very narrow. however, they are light weight and seems super durable. I really wanted them to fit but my foot was just too wide. i loved the look and everything about these boots... hopefully they make a wide version in the future.", "First trip with these boots was into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The traction was great alternating between slick mud and slick rock surfaces. Ankle support was awesome as I carried a canoe in tight spaces with few foot options. Worked great keeping the water out and my feet dry- that is until I got out of the canoe a bit early in deep water and flooded the inside of my boots!", "Nearly perfect. Near the end of the shoe, left toes felt squished. Not wide enough, and I have tiny tiny feet for a man. Otherwise, perfect boots. Fantastic look, great stability, awesome laces, all around perfect. After a week of wear, width seems to be fine now. Will probably need breaking in.", "The Salomon Quest 4D GTX fit great right out of the box. I wore them for a day for break in although they didn't need it. My feet settled in and they were happy. I was looking for good ankle support and these boots give me all I need. The true test will come on my upcoming backpacking trip in Michigan. To start, great purchase and good price, but time and trails will be the judge. P.S. Nobody paid me, gave me free product, or gave me discounts to say these things. I'm saving a star for after the trip if deemed worthy by the trail gods!", "I have owned these boots for two years now. They are wonderful out of the box. However, the layers of material in the boot soles are now coming apart. The glue has completely broken down. I should have much more wear from these boots than I've gotten. There must be better choices than this. Recommend you avoid.", "Overall a very nice and comfortable hiking boot. Have put about 30 miles of hiking in very rough terrain and the support is excellent. Only negative as others have pointed out is the laces. They are way too stiff and do not stay tied for long. I took them off and tried to soften them by stretching and compressing them which improved them a little but they are still much too stiff and hard to cinch properly.", "Great boots that are comfortable, sturdy yet not too heavy on the feet. Got these for my husband who works in Horticulture and he says they're perfect for his job. They protect his feet and are very well made.", "Awesome boot. Used for day hiking but feels like it could work for long multi day hikes as well. Stays dry. Haven't used in snow yet but hot summer and rain they work great. Awesome traction and strong ankle support.", "They look as if they have some heft to them but are surprisingly very light. A little uncomfortable over my toe knuckle area until I was able to break them in and now they feel great and have kept my feet dry during pouring rain.", "I've been on 12 hunts totaling over 60 days and these boots are amazing in all terrains. These were back pack in type hunts with packs over 75lbs. No break in period", "My husband purchased this after after we recently took up hiking. He's taken this on several hikes now & has been more than pleased w/ his choice. Great ankle support, waterproof (stepped into some muddy water, but inside remained dry), comfortable & has yet to have any blisters. He was able to get this on amazon at half off what REI was selling for. Sorry REI, that was too good of a deal!", "These boots are incredible !!! Well built, higher than normal for better ankle support. Lacing pulls nice and tight and stays put ! Extremely comfortable and very good support , surprisingly lightweight and so far completely waterproof!! I can't say enough about how great these boots are. I bought them for \" run & gun \" spring Turkey hunting in the mountains of PA, and they performed perfectly", "Very nice boot but was maybe a half size to large. This boot is also heavy and stiff not the best for light hiking. Boot is surprisingly comfortable and stable for it stiffness. Buy if you need a heavy duty rugged boot for backpacking or winter weather. And remember to buy at leased a half size smaller the you normally wear.", "This is my second pair. The best hiking shoe I have owned. This second pair leaks, but Amazon is awesome and is replacing them free. The lacing system allows me to adjust the tightness so that I can leave them a bit looser for all day wear on the job or I can snug them up for a rigorous hike on varying terrain. Good looking, I've received compliments on the looks wearing them at work.", "I like to hike up semi-steep terrain which sometimes tends to be wet. Wearing other type shoes I would slip here and there. These boots have excellent traction. I have never slipped once wearing these.", "I bought these for my husband....He did a little dance! Great product with great quality. The colors compliment each other. I high recommend this boot. Happy husband, happy wife, happy life!", "Nice boots. Great price if you're ok with the color (which I am). Local shops have these boots at over $200. They were slightly small for me at first however I bought some thinner, merino wool blend hiking socks and now they fit as expected. Looking forward to hiking this year!", "My husband wears boots all the time for work, being in the military and I bought these for him for hiking. These are great quality and my husband verbalized how comfortable they are. He has bad knees and reported no knee issues after wearing these. I would highly recommend !!", "Best model of hiking boot I've ever had for fit, comfort, performance, traction and waterproofing, but some serious questions as to build quality. First pair had to be returned because of slight sole separation and some faulty stitching. I have the previous version of this shoe - the sole separated almost completely from the upper - I glued it back, and it has worked great since. Be sure to check out any pair you buy COMPLETELY before wearing them!!", "I haven't put them to task yet but fit, craftsmanship amazing. I am 10.5 but my recommended size for Mt. Kilimanjaro is 11.0 and they are what the doctor ordered, hence my 5 star rating. What's more, I consulted a professional who is all too familiar with mount Kili and these boots were among his top favorites. I will put them to task sometime in 2017 and will put an update then!!", "This is a nice boot and it came highly recommended for backpacking light. However it fit too narrow in the instep. I had pressure points while trying them on at home, no room for foot swelling. Unfortunately I had to return them.", "Salomon Quest 4d a bit heavy looking but light on the feet and fit perfectly no complaints here!", "Supportive and nimble. Make sure to take it for a short hike before your big trip", "Went hiking in PA with these with only having worn them for a couple hours. I put a little over 30 miles on them in two days on some fairly rugged terrain. It rained like crazy the first day hiking in them. My feet stayed warm and dry the entire time. Would highly recommend them. Very comfortable and at this time, I can't think of any negatives with them.", "Got my boots today and went on a three mile hike with my dog after I inserted Dr. Scholl's. I am 46 and a fraction of the athlete I used to be. I have soft Lilly white feet and these boots are every thing I need to explore the back country minus the painful blisters, and it has everything to do with the durable construction and rugged materials used in putting these well designed boots together.", "The Salomon Quest 4D 2 GTX hiking boots fit as expected, keep my feet rather warm and dry (with wool socks), and serve great for hiking or normal use with snow on-ground. I used these in conjunction with the Yaktrax Pro Traction Cleats to shovel and salt my driveway, which is on an incline, after snowfall and didn't slip once! These boots will definitely see more mileage through various terrain and weather conditions.", "I have had these boots for roughly a month now and they have seen close to 100mi. No break in required was a plus. The lacing system is nice. These guys won't come lose on you in 5 or 30 miles. If I had anything negative to say, I would like to have a stiffer sole. Great boots nevertheless.", "I have tried several pairs of hunting boots and never quite found what I was looking for. After finding these the search is now over. They are amazing. They don't have extremely heavy use but I have had them 2 years now and they are still waterproof.", "Great boots, at a great price. These came highly recommended by a friend and I can see why. Very comfortable and the Gortex definitely does its job. I look forward to many miles on these.", "Toe guard is coming away from boot. Sides of the tongue are unravelling. Really disappointing as I've never had a pair of Salomons give up the ghost like this after only a few months. Apparently it is now past the return date so buying boots from Amazon means no guarantees in the long term. i wont be buying boots from Amazon again. ** Amazon are now sending a replacement pair at no cost to myself. I can't fault them in this regard.", "I ordered one pair that were defective so I sent them back and got a full refund. I ordered a second pair that were just right, I love them. By far the best hiking boots I've ever had.", "I am a size 10.5 in Adidas, 10.5 in Converse, and 10.5 in Nike. I ordered this in size 10.5 but it is a little tight near the tip of my toes. I then ordered a size 11, and they fit much better! Give your toes a little room to breath. I recommend going a 1/2 size up to be more comfortable.", "So far so good. I've only logged a few miles but the boots are extremely comfortable and didn't really require a break-in period. Looking forward to taking these on longer trips. The boots feel like they will be durable and are made of quality materials.", "Amazing comfortable, less stiff traditional full leather uppers. Great traction, could NOT be happier! Looking forward to taking it on some summer hikes, and using while shoveling out in the winter!", "I tried on a pair at a local store first so I new I had to get a size bigger. I wear a 10 to 10.5, I got these in an 11. I do a lot of really rugged hiking every day for work 10 hours to sometimes 16 hours and I love these boots boots so far. comfortable and well designed,", "I ordered half size over my normal and they fit perfectly. Most comfortable shoe I ever had!", "I love these boots. I have issues with one of my feet where I need a stiffer sole than a trail running shoe, as well as more substantial ankle support. These fit the bill perfectly. Felt great right out of the box. I wore them the entire first day with no issues at all, a good sign.", "My second pair of the best all around hiking boot. Very supportive. Durable I have slightly wide foot with high instep. Fit me great. Not ideal for people with narrow feet, so I've heard. Generous toe box.", "5 star comfort. 1 star for out of the box peeling toe cap. Will update soon to see if this is an issue with Salomon and Amazon or just the boot design itself. Otherwise great fit and feel.", "I've owned at least one pair of Salomon hiking boots since about 1997. I can always count on a good fit which means I can shop online with some confidence. I recently bought a second pair of these so I could have a \"kick around\" pair for working our property. They provide excellent support which is important to my purchasing decision.", "I am a woman with wide feet. These boots fit my feet and are comfortable for walking, even over uneven or rocky terrain. The soles are soft enough for my sensitive feet and hard enough to prevent my feet from feeling the rocks. I also like the locking hook system that holds the boot laces in place and prevents my heels from slipping forward as I am walking.", "The best I've had so far. I've been buying these boots for 3 years so far and never has a drop been felt on my feet when I walk through deep water. Excellent ankle support. Seriously awesome boot", "These boots rock! Very comfortable even after 25 miles through goat trails. Highly recommended if your looking for comfortable waterproof and durable boots. I love these boots", "Very awesome boots! Takes a few hours of break-in time, which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Fit is perfect & feel is even better. Rugged good looks and very high quality.", "Others have covered how great these boots are so I'll just chime in to ring the same bell. Best boots I've ever owned: fit, traction, comfort, looks and price all 5 stars. Perfect for my low volume feet and smaller heal. Not for those with wide or high volume feet. Near perfect so far in my 40 or so miles on the trail and 20 or so in the city.", "Probably one of the best boots I've ever owned, I bought 2 already and love salomons shoes, I own 4 pairs in different types, I have 6 pairs of Asolo boots and these Solomons are just as good. With a good pair of socks they work well in all kinds of weather, worked in high temps in Az and cold weather in Colorado great for heavy pack loads in rough terrain. In fact most all my work buddies own the same pair and same the same thing. Well worth the money", "I didn't believe the no break-in hype, but it is true. First time out was 4 plus miles and they were great. Much better than trail runners for trails that have lots of rocks.", "Bomb! I finally found boots that fit. I took these out of the box and wore them chukar hunting in Hell's Canyon - lots of climbing, side-hilling, and down hill pounding. I had no problems whatsoever. After multiple other hikes and hunts, I can say these are the best boots I've worn. Highly recommended.", "Can't say enough about these boots! I just purchased them a few days ago and have already hiked several miles in them and have had no problems! They don't need to be broken in. They are very much waterproof and warm! Also the lightweight design makes these perfect for backpacking trips. Highly recommend!", "Really nice boots. After 20 years, I decided it was time to get a new pair of boots for multi-day backpacking and day hikes. It's amazing how durable these are for the lighter weight, and they seem to be totally waterproof. The fit is also great. I usually have to order a size up for boots, but these fit just fine in my regular shoe size -both with heavy winter socks and light summer socks.", "I've beaten these boots to hell and they're still holding up. great quality and very comfortable. The speed lacing system however is crapola, they are a definite pain to lace up,", "I live in the Shenandoah Valley and hike many trails. I was turned on to these boots by a friend and after buying them he is still my friend. The fit was great right out of the box. Break-in only took a few short hikes. Lets see how they handle a few seasons. My friend has owned his for 2 years and they still look strong.", "These hiking boots are excellent for walking over rough terrain. I purchased them because they were recommended by experienced off road trekkers. They provide excellent support for a weak left ankle.", "I ordered these for a friend after he had been searching high and low for boots. He is pretty picky about durability, comfort, and price. He is very happy and has been wearing them since. He spends most of the day on his feet.", "Purchased these as a replacement for their 3-4 year old model. Figured since I liked the earlier model so much and they lasted quite long, I would purchase the new model. The previous model was a bit wider, which I need, so these are not as comfortable. Otherwise,I believe these will last a long time and be a great hiking shoe.", "Excellent boots fit exactly as the ones I previously tried at the store, I have not use them to hike yet but I'm very happy with how they feel on my feet now. I definitely recommend it", "Quality Boot! Very comfortable. This boot is lightweight for how sturdy it is. Roomy toe box. Recomend sizing up 1/2 size for proper fit with normal weight sock.", "Great boots. They fit well, have great support, built tough, and proven to be waterproof. I will purchase these again once they wear out in a year or two. Only thing I can see that could possibly be a downside is that they are probably a little too warm for the summer. Other than that they are perfect.", "I bought this boot 2 weeks before attending the Boy Scouts National Jamboree. I wore them every day leading up to the jamboree to break them in and experienced absolutely no hot-spots or issues. During the jamboree I wore them and consistently walked 12-15 miles every day without any discomfort. The quality is high and the weight is low for these boots.", "Spouse has had these boots before (clarify-- prior version of this boot), last time they were bought at a large outdoor/gear store for about $60. more. They have already been tried on/worn for a little while and they are exactly as expected. Very happy! Great boot.", "Fit was good, but a little more arch support would help. sturdy construction and solid but roomy (for my feet) toe box. One of the internal seams or lace eyelets was rubbing my foot the wrong way on the inside so I returned them. Going to try a few other brands and might come back to these and hope it was just this one pair that did that.", "I had major reconstructive surgery of my right foot about a year ago. I had totally rest the foot for 6 months, then have very gradually increased use. The Solomon GTX hiking boot provides amazing support for my arch and ankle, and is super light. It allowed me to significantly increase my walking without pain, unlike other shoes and boots that I tried. So, I am grateful.", "Great boots, only took a couple of hikes before they were broken in. I wore these on a trip to Alaska's back country and they held up great! They are the best boots for backpacking with 30lb+ loads I have ever worn.", "The consistent fit across Solomon shoes and boots was a key factor in my buying them. They are both rugged and light weight. Hiked 8 miles with 30 Lbs pack two days after getting them. No problems. Sloshed through water and they were dry on the inside. I like boots with the BOA lacing system. These are the first lace-up boots I have purchased in quite awhile. The Solomon lacing system on these boots is very good. Urge Solomon to add boots with the Boa lacing also. These boots also look good!", "A superior fitting and very comfortable boot. This is my second pair and they have not disappointed me. I highly recommend these for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet, backpackers, military operators, law enforcement officers, etc.", "Bought them as a present for my boyfriend, he is currently breaking them in - they are very nice and seem to made very well. He hasn't hiked in them yet but he says they feel like they will be great once their broken in.", "Best \"hiking\" boots I've ever had. Very supportive, Heel stays put with plenty of room in the toe area.And for once the laces are good - not the super cheap one that come on most shoe/boots theses days. Will be buying another pair.", "For great, wore out my asolos and tried these to replace them. They are wider in the toe box than asolos which I like, and they have a wider footprint than the asolos too. I am getting them broke in for Philmont.", "I bought this for trekking in nepal. Very comfortable after break in. Just note no amount of high cuts can prevent an ankle sprain. Watch your steps.", "My last pair lasted two years and 3 months. I wore them everyday for work. The bottom sole on left boot came apart from the boot. It's too early to give a review for these boots.", "I have had them a week and I am about to go on a 4 day long fishing/backpacking trip on the Kern river, which will be the true test. I have worn them for two mini practice hikes of 3.5 miles with a 25lb pack and i had no blisters or hot spots. They are Gortex and will be quite warm in warm weather. So far they are great and I am looking forward to this weekend with them.", "Did a lot of research before ordering these boots. They have met all of my expectations for design, quality and performance in the outdoors. They wear very comfortably with excellent support. This was my first pair of Salomon footwear and I will likely return to this brand in the future.", "Fits as expected. Sometimes have to adjust the tongue when put on. If it isn't just right, it bothers my leg some but when its right, it's great. Did get them out on a muddy trail and kept my feet dry and had very good traction. Did not submerge above ankle. Overall, I'm very happy with them.", "As always, Salomon knocks it out of the ballpark. I needed hiking boots for a transition from a boot for a broken bone to regular shoes. I bought Salomon because I love their tennis shoes. I had to wear these for 2 months everyday while my foot was healing and I ended up wearing them even longer. Waterproof, comfortable....overall great hiking boot!", "These boots are all the reviews made them out to be. They fit as I expected. They are some of the most comfortable boots I've owned.", "Fantastic gtx boots. Replaced a pair of vasque boots I had for 5 years. These are crazy comfortable and waterproof. I've done a few 6-7 mile hikes in them as well as a 16 mile backpacking trip last weekend and I couldn't be happier with how they performed.", "My Son & I were looking for an early season boot to traverse the mountains for Elk. These fit the bill much more than I expected. They are almost 1 1/2 lbs lighter than my original Cabelas Outfitter boots which I really like but lacked some strength in ankle support. I'm very impressed with the overall construction of the Salomon Quest 4D 2 GTX hiking boots. Excellent ankle support and the traction on the sole has very good depth and provides non slip maneuverability in most terrain conditions.", "These boots are unstoppable. Since I have owned them i have taken them into the snow, rain, and dirt with no problems. We have gone bushwacking, snow shoeing, and even on scrambles together. Great grip and the since these are waterproof they are a breeze to clean. Very cozy too.", "Very high quality hiking boot that I've been watching for quite some time. I finally pulled the trigger and I'm pleased with this product.", "only had for a few days. I am very pleased with the fit and the way these boots wear. I have worn these boots all day and have had no issues at all. on first impressions, I would recommend these boots. will update later.", "Took these on a 30 mile hike and they were the best boots I have ever owned. These boots held up and I arrived home with not a single blister. The last time I made this same hike I was covered up with blisters so these did the job!!! Great boots!!'", "Very stiff (in a good way) yet very light for a well structured boot. I haven't tried to fit a crampon on them yet but I suspect they\"ll work out ok. The first hike in them was only about 7 miles. THey were a bit uncomfortable but after wearing them around for a couple of days they seem to be breaking in are now pretty comfy.", "From CO, love these boot! Great traction, been hiking in snow, mud, on CO granite trails all month. Excellent traction, plenty warm, great fit 0 blisters after many miles so far. Short break in period. Got a terrific lightening deal at $129 but I'd pay full price for these boots, great boots.", "Best boots I have ever worn and I\u2019ve worn boots at work for 25+ years. I bought them for SWAT ops and am very pleased. I will buy another pair soon for off duty.", "I was pleased with my examination of my Salomon Quest 4D 2 Gtx hiking boots. They are quite good looking and the materials are top notch. I wear a size 11 in most footwear and these in this size were a perfect fit. The key will be how well they wear.", "My husban loves his boots, he's been hiking a lot, theo ly thi g is that when some water geta in the boot you have to take it off to empty it and it takes a while for them to dry. They are really comftable. Have a great grip!", "I've owned many brands of hiking boots, but none that perform like these. I recently completed a 41 mile hike in the Sierras and because of the comfort, fit, stability, and design of the Quest 4D, I returned without a single blister, bloody toenail, or hotspot. Paired with the Fox River military wicking socks, these boots made for an incredible hike. I am so impressed by them that I'm tempted to purchase a backup pair just in case Salomon discontinues or changes the design.", "I love these boots but I had to order them 1/2 size bigger because I have a high instep. Anyone who has wide feet or high instep order at least 1/2size bigger than your current size. You won't be disappointed.", "I liked these boots so much I bought another pair. I've used them from hiking, backpacking, and even wet canyoneering. They are the most comfortable pair of boots I own. No hot spots after walking 20miles, well sore feet but no blisters. They have held up well to the through oak scrub brush and weeds while hunting.", "I am ultimately impressed by the quality, fit and comfort of these boots. I have put a good 30 miles on them in rough terrain in the smoky mountains and they have done well. When they say they are water proof, believe them. Just do not dunk your entire leg in water, then it will get inside. The only thing i can ask for would be better gripping for large rocks but not entirely sure that thats what it is made for so not a knock on the boots at all. Try them on at REI before you buy them online. Best advice i have.", "This is a great boot and fits so secure. I love the support it gives my ankles while hiking and the overall weight is perfect as well. I have only put maybe 12 miles in them so far but I love everything about them so far.", "Awesome boots! As a Park Ranger, we are on the trails all day. Whether, Interpretation, Hiking and or Rescues, it is very important to have a boot that you can depend on. These Salomon boots do the job very well. I highly recommend these boots!", "Have purchased 2 pair, one for myself and this pair for my husband. Ordered both a half size up based on previous comments and they fit perfectly. Had wither of us ordered our normal size they would have just been too tight! Great boot overall", "Third pair in the last 15 years, they wear and fit me to a tee!", "My husband loves these boots! Lightweight, comfortable, extra large opening to easily put boots on, great for any outdoor adventure. But nice enough to wear for other events. Definitely cannot beat the price.", "Great all around waterproof boot, very comfortable right out of the box and wears well. This is my husbands second pair he likes them so much. Arrived on time, fit is right on size and nice color.", "I waited for these to go on sale and was well worth the wait. Perfect hiking boots that have served me well so far. I tend to explore muddy/wet/slippery locations and I have yet to take a spill.", "I will be testing them in Northern Minnesota BWCA in two weeks time. I will update the durability and waterproofing capabilities then. After a couple short hikes the boot felt fine. A little taller than I expected, however I don't feel that is a negative.", "These are the best outdoor shoes you can buy. I work on all kids of production products filming in the middle of nowhere, hike miles, hunt and live in the outdoors and these things are amazing. I would only suggest airing them out after a good day of use.", "Love every pair of Solomon shoes/boot I have owned thus far. I normally wear an 11.5 running shoe, but go with a 12 boot. The 12 wasn't too big for me. Heel is locked in and doesn't move and the toes aren't hitting on the steep descents. There is also plenty of room for a thicker pair of wool socks for those colder days.", "My hubby wears a 12. They fit perfect! Very lightweight and comfortable.", "I've put on a lot of miles and these are the best boots I've ever owned hands down. Comfortable, durable and super waterproof. 15-20 mile days are a breeze in these.", "I just took these boots on a hiking trip where conditions were extreme; snow and rain. I was wading through puddles and trudging through snow fields and my socks didn't get wet at all. Highly recommend these boots.", "Excellent boot. Fit as expected. Wear a 10m and fit was spot on. Great traction and ankle support. I have a pair of keen targee too. The salomon is much better boot. targee is a very good boot but Salomon quest is just better all around. Highly recommend if you can purchase them at 145 or less.", "I ordered a half size larger as per some viewer's instructions, so far I really like the boots but time will tell when I get them out in the wilderness.", "Love these Salomon's, 3rd pair plus a winter boot. Wore also Lowe's which I think are more comfortable but I wear them out faster. I have a right ankle I broke twice and hate wearing a custom made brace, with these they go high enough and lace well so I don't need to wear my brace.", "Highly rated shoe, but no wide size. I bought 1 size higher but didn't help.", "This is my third pair of Salomons and this is a great boot! I think they've used their years of experience with ski boots to make these. They snug my heal into the boot better than any other - right out of the box.", "Amazing boots, great for hiking, good support. If you are looking for a durable, high end boot, look no further. It's a bit pricy compared to others, but you cannot put a price on level of foot pain after a long hard day of mountain climbing.", "LOVE these boots. Extremely comfortable and require little-to-no breaking in. Can't recommend them highly enough.", "After using exactly the same Salomons for a year and hiking over 500 miles I decided to replace them with exactly the same model. Again as the previous pair they are comfortable on the first use. Best hiking boots I ever owned.", "I bought these shoes for a sole purpose : climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Thanks to a fellow reviewer who spoke highly of this on that kind of terrain . It was an excellent decision I made , thru about 90 miles , and all kinds of terrain all the way to the freezing summit , my feet looked good and felt good , I literally had zero blisters . Super durable , I even wore it on a 15.5 hours flight , and felt very comfortable . If you're a serious hiker , do ur self a favor and buy it .", "For working and hiking I've tried dozens of brands the last four decades. These Salomons are, by far, the most comfortable footwear I have ever owned. It's almost as if they measured my foot and custom made a pair just to fit me perfectly. This is my second pair, by the way. I used and abused my first pair for years and they were fantastic. Worth every penny", "Damn good boots. Very comfortable, good ankle support, feels tough. Only downside is the laces are rough and rubbed my fingers raw tying them, but that's a small price to pay for having some fantastic boots.", "These are by far the best boots I have ever owned!! I live and work on a huge cattle ranch and live in boots... The are so light and comfy... yet still stiff like a boot! Had one problem, after having them soaking wet for a few days straight I managed to pull too hard on them and yanked an eyelet out... Called them and they sent me a new pair... Had them on my feet two days later.!!! Just awesome!! Highly recommend to anyone that need a serious boot!!! A+++", "I only have 18 trail miles on them BUT they are as great as my fellow trekers said they were great ankle support excellent traction and SO comfortable . No knee or calf pain when wearing them . I highly recommend this product.", "These boots are very light and take a beating while hiking. I have worn these boots for many months and they still look new. Medium to light hiking only. For heavy nothing is better than the Asolo TP520. I would rank the Salomon as the best medium to light pack boot.", "Amazing bootsies. You can stand in rushing water up to your ankles and stay completely dry. It's really fun. I am overcome with confidence upon bestowing these upon my feet.", "Great hiking boots! I had a pair of Asolo's for 12 years until the soles disintegrated on me. I bought these Solomons to replace those and they feel just as comfortable and solid after my first short hike with them. Incredible bargain for the price!", "These are about the best hiking boots I've ever worn. The support is great; they fit my feet perfectly (normally a challenge). They're very warm, so they would be great for hunting in the higher elevations or in cold/wet weather.", "These boots are awesome and this is my second pair. They are a little narrow so recommend you break them in over time until the fabric breaks in a bit. Other than that they stay dry, warm, and are a great hiking boot.", "Boots are surprisingly light considering they offer full ankle support and waterproofing. They are very comfortable. I recommend walking in them for a few miles to break them in. I walked my dog wearing them for a couple of miles and by the end of the walk, they felt great. I can't wait to go on a hike and try them out longer term.", "I've owned many differnt pairs of Salomon footwear. These are very comfortable and provide great support on long rugged hikes when you're carrying some weight, but within the first 15 hours of use, part of the rubber toe cap started to come off. I still wear them, however.", "Haven't really tested them on a hike yet, but comfortable, stable and well-fitting out of the box. They were not cheap, but still I was sorry to learn that the manufacturer has discontinued this model to make cheaper (less well made) shoes (which I handled at the store while looking for this model) to sell at a lower price point. Kind of makes this review academic.", "First hiking boot and was skeptical about the price. First tried them on and they felt narrow around the foot so I was worreid. But after a week break in period they fit and feel great. Even bought another pair for the misses.", "Strong enough to trample on the wings of angels. Takes some time to break into though... Tough son of a bitch!", "They already feel broken in. I wear a sz.12 normally; with a 12.5, they're perfect with thick socks. I tried to simulate rolling my ankle, and the stability of these things is amazing. Also, I've been wearing them to work every day to break them in fully before my next hike, and with cheap thick socks, my feet aren't hot/sweaty, even after a long day. Well worth the money!", "Width allows for thicker socks which I really like. They took only 30 miles or so to really start to break in. Good support. Good grip on all surfaces. Not to hot and breath well while keeping me dry when crossing streams.", "Bought these for a 49km backpacking trip on the Juan De Fuca Trail on Vancouver Island, BC Canada, and I was amazed that there was no break-in period for them. They provided the traction, stability and comfort for the 3 night, 4 day adventure over rocky beaches, muddy roots, and steep accents and decents.", "Used it in trans Catalina trail. I'm impressed on how it holds my ankle very well while stepping uneven rocks. Walked almost 8hrs.", "It is very well made but the upper part is too stiff for light hiking. If you need a stiff boot then this may be for you. Also, the sole is not as comfortable as others even though it has a nice orthotic insole.", "These boots are very comfortable and fit as expected. I have pretty wide feet and they are a little snug. After putting a few miles on them I went to Yellowstone for a week. It rained every day, my feet got wet every day!! These are great for a splash in a puddle but not if your are going to be in the ran and snow for several hours.", "Very solid shoe and waterproof as well; I am pleased with my purchase so far! I work over in the \"sandbox\" so we'll see how these hold up over time. Usually I wear Merrells which are very comfortable but do not last very long, at least based on the wear and tear I put shoes through so I am curious as to how these will stand up.", "Waited a few weeks before reviewing. Wore them to a football game and several other trips. Very comfortable and supportive around the ankles.", "I got these boots for a fishing trip up in mammoth, they have exceeded my expectations and fit extremely comfortable for my foot size. They provide great ankle support and warmth in cold weather. They make a great stream fishing boot because at one point I slipped in the stream ankle deep and my foot stayed completely dry! I highly recommend these boots to anyone who is looking for a versatile all around boot!", "(Reviewed by John) So far I am pleased with the construction of this boot. I followed some suggestions about sizing and went a half size up. I received a perfect fit. They are stiff but I anticipate they will break in just fine. Looking forward to getting on the trail(s).", "This is my second pair of Salomon shoes. Both have fit exactly as expected. They are very stable and solid feeling without being uncomfortable. The only complaint that I have are they are a bit on the warm side. I was hoping these would be a little cooler, but it's not a deal breaker. Will definitely look at Salomon again the next time I need shoes.", "I've had these for a few weeks now. These are very high quality boots! Arrived on time. Fits perfect, especially after purchasing $10 insoles for them. The ones that they come with aren't adequate, but the overall build of the shoe is solid. Worth every penny I paid for them! I highly recommend this pair if you're honestly considering them.", "2nd pair- bought first ones for high ankle support and light weight. 2nd pr a few mm shorter and few oz heavier but still fine. No break in time except to get the shine off the tread. They fit well enough to sleep in. I guess I have a \"Salomon foot\"- also like their shoes.", "These boots are great, they support your ankles extremely well and are very stable. Very comfortable to wear however the size was a little small but not to the point that I couldn't wear them. Definately worth buying espeacially if you need good ankle support like I do.", "These are great boots for hiking and backpacking. They fit well and are very comfortable as well as providing plenty of support.", "Excellent hiking boots don't think that they're worth full retail price though. I got the color nobody liked and saved $85. Don't use insoles in them, it raises your ankle caused severe blisters. Lesson learned hike the way you trained.", "We ordered them large so wearing thick socks would not be a problem! My husband has hiked Table Rock Mountain in SC and Gray's Peak in Colorado in them and they are very comfortable and durable .", "Great fitting, lightweight boot. Only took a couple of days to fully break in. Feet stay dry and comfortable in wet conditions and are provided great traction. I was a bit reluctant to spend the money but am happy I did. These are high quality backpacking boots.", "This is my third pair of quests. I bought two earlier so I could change off on vacation but they are so comfortable I started wearing one pair at work so I needed another pair for hiking trips. Most comfortable boot with the best traction sole I have ever owned. Very warm in the winter but breathable during summer hikes.", "Extremely comfortable, warm and dry, right out of the box. Zero break in period. This is my second pair of Salomons in 24 months, and I am extremely pleased. As a Law Enforcement, and specialized tactical shooting instructor, these are my go-to range boots. I run them HARD and I've never been disappointed. Gary Underhill Trinity Tactical LLC Reno, NV", "Hiked 20 miles in one day on the APT new out of box. Feet were comfortable and no blisters. I wore tough darn socks ,coolmax and am very pleased. No signs of wear and tear of my first hike.", "From toe to toe (12D), its a better width for my foot than vasque st elias. Although i like the looks of the vasque st elias better, im keeping the salomon. This boot seems a bit better to support a bad ankle as well. Both are great great boots.", "Fantastic boot! Salomon delivers on quality and comfort. The ankle support is really good.", "I've had Scarpa boots for 20 years and thought I'd try these after reading a favourable review. I really like the lacing, they were comfortable and easier on the feet especially on hard surfaces like roads. BUT after 6 months and not that much walking the heels started disintegrating. Really disappointed and will now return to Scarpas after this experiment. UPDATE: Salomon have replaced the boots, hope the new ones last a bit longer", "Seems like a great boot. But seems borrow. I have not worn them outside yet. May send them back. Would exchange them for a wider size if it were available. Will update the review when I decide.", "Great boot, I ordered a half size too big and they fit perfectly. At $145 they are a lot cheaper than what I would have paid at a store.", "comfortable boots. Probably a shorter break in than normal. They felt weird to me at first, probably because my last pair of boots was molded to my foot after 3 years.", "Finally, a reasonably light boot that fits! Love that they're offered in half sizes throughout their entire range. Sturdy enough for winter use, and very comfortable to use with universal crampons.", "This is my go to desert sheep hunt boot. Helps me with hard climbs and heavy (40-50lbs) backpack. Super comfortable but stiff enough for very hard climbs. Its not waterproof.", "super comfy :P we will see how long they last i have been abusing them.", "I would give these ten stars, if I could, my husbands Luvs them. Very light wait ,a sturdy all around boot! Very well made.", "These are well-made and comfortable hiking boots. I have used them in both the Smokey Mountains and dreary, Ohio winter weather. Dirt, mud, snow, and ice stand no chance against these babies. I would highly recommend investing in them. You won't regret it!", "These boots are awesome and worth the price. I have owned multiple salmon foot wear products and they never let me down. Fits just right and I would buy them again.", "Used the boots right from the box for a 3 day backpacking trip over 21 miles. Comfortable boots provided great support on rough terrain. Recommend without hesitation. Excited for my next adventure.", "For a men's boot these were small. Not even enough room for a regular sock. I really liked the ankle support though. Not wide or flexible enough for me.", "these shoes are just what I needed for hiking. I have weak ankles and these provide me with the support to go over roots and rocks with ease.", "3rd pair of Salomon Quest boots. These are no exception to their high quality and dependability. You won't be sorry you purchased them!", "Good fit, super comfy. Will be taking them on the trail tomorrow.", "I have just gotten these boots and first impressions are very good. Fit true to size and very comfortable out of the box. Hope to put serious trail miles on them soon and will update this review.", "I love these boots. I build houses for a living and use them year round. I will continue to buy them until they are no longer available don\u2019t waist your money on anything else. Like I said they are amazing", "The break in period was longer than I would have liked. I almost returned them. They are water proof and seem to be holding up very well. I go hiking with my dogs twice a week.", "Fits like running shoes and I did order them 1/2 a size bigger. Totally waterproof too, make sure you lace correctly to get best fit. Googe how to lace hiking boots", "I am retiring in September, and my wife and I are planning an extended vacation to Australia. Shoes are built like like tanks. Planning to break them in over the course of the next several months, so that by the time we leave for Australia they will be ready for the walking that we will be doing.", "Very Comfortable. Have only wore them around town so far. They are very comfortable and light weight. My only worry is when I get into rocks, will the sole protect my feet. But I wear them almost everyday, and only hit the trails once or twice a month, so I think they are going to be perfect for me.", "Awesome boots! Bombproof!! Built to last. I love them. Ordered 9 1/2, my normal size. Were to tight to be comfortable for extended periods of wear. Returned for a size up (10). I really hope they work for me. Depression will set it if not, lol.", "I have not had the opportunity to wear them a lot, but initial comfort is great. My wife has been wearing the women's version for the last 2 years and really likes them a lot.", "These are the first hiking boots that I have worn. I am impressed with the improvement over running shoes. I have worn these for a few miles and they have been very comfortable with great ankle support.", "Best hiking boots I ever wore. The heel is held firm and won't slip but the ball of the foot is roomy to allow toes to move. Yet the foot doesn't slide up to the front on down hills.", "Great boot. Roomy toe box, solid build and very comfortable right out of the box. Just a little stiff, but no hot spots at all. For serious climbing, I like the support they provide. Have completed a climb and adventure race in them with no trouble at all. Just the right mix of support and comfort...heavy enough to provide stability but light enough to race in.", "I've been sized 11-11.5 EE-EEE and these boots in 11.5 M fit my wierd feet fine. Comfy, ridiculously sturdy upper construction, the green canvas-like material is looks great. Awesome ankle support. Haven't gotten a chance to hike in them yet but they're so comfortable and look so good that I've worn them every day since I got them, at least a month by now, to and from school each day and at work on my feet. Might never buy another pair of boots again. Salomon rocks!", "Not knowing the exact size to order, I chose the usual shoe size I wear (101/2 US). I found that size was a bit too tight to wear a heavy hiking sock. Therefore returned and re-ordered a size 11. All good now; feeling good after minimal \"break in\" and ready for some real miles. Other than the fit issue, the boot seems to be of good quality and design. Although quite a bit lighter than my good old Merrell's, I don't think it's quite as sturdy. With a heavy pack, (40lbs+) you might want something more robust.", "Amazing boot. I don\u2019t hike but do hunt and ride motorcycles. These boots provide a superior comfort.", "Used these on a backpacking trip to Alaska with our scout troop. They worked great and held up really well in the back country.", "These boots came out of the box feeling a little off in the right arch, but after a few hours of break-in, they are great! Had them out in the woods all weekend and they were very comfortable, gave good support, and both breathed well during the day and maintained heat with a thick pair of socks at night.", "Arrived on time. They fit as expected. These boots are light and super comfortable. Great grip. A bit concerned about the plastic lace ties. Other than that, badass boots. I have boots of all different brands. None of them were out of the box ready to rip it up \"broke in\" like these Salomons.", "These boot are great. At least for back packing. They are also good for hiking, but two things. They don't breath at all to me so my feet get hot in them. A bonus in the winter. And they are heavy. But all in all excellent boot. Very stable.", "These are just awesome boots. I haven't had anything that supports me like this, ever. I swear, soon they will be telling me to go back to school and follow my dreams. Lightweight, fantastic ankle support, and the grip inspires confidence in short leaps/scrambles.", "Very comfortable boot. Haven't done any intense hiking it yet, but incredibly comfortable and waterproof in what I have done.", "I use these boots to walk about 4 miles everyday on a tread mill with a 20lb backpack at 15 degrees. They are comfortable work out boots. They have arch support as well as ankle support. The soles are not too soft nor are they too hard. The only issue is the strings not only are they too long but the material is too slick to stayed tied I have to tuck them in to keep them from flopping around.", "The boots fit great and as expected. I took them out for a short hike and ended up in a downpour of hail and rain. Every inch of my body was wet except my feet. The only issue is as usual the laces want to come untied all the time. But the boots are great!!!!", "Comfortable and good protection from rocks and dirt. Time will show how durable they are. No the best boot to drive a car", "Great Boot. I wear 10 for running shoes and 10.5 for daily shoes. Ordered a 10 and fits perfect. Ties up nice with lots of support. Rugged and comfortable.", "Super Awrsome Boot! Take your time breaking in, but once you do it's like two gloved hands of God helping you with every step. Worth the Money. They also make me look prittier than normal, thanks Solomon, you stylie Devils !", "These boots are awesome. I usually hike 15+ miles on various trails in the Shenandoah, and this boot is the perfect fit and provides excellent ankle support. They are waterproof, so a change of socks mid-hike helps keep the feet nice and dry. Definitely a comfortable shoe.", "My son purchased these to wear to Philmont, NM. He leaves in 10 days. He has worn them on all his prep camping trips up steep mountains and in the wind and rain - this was an AWESOME purchase. Well worth the money! Don't forget to purchase great hiking/backpacking socks too!", "My Second pair. Fit just like the old ones did when they were new. Laces seem a little shorter though and since they need to be double knotted I liked the longer ones.", "Always quality, and always a great purchase. I've worn and hiked in all of the top lines my whole life. Fell in love with Solly (two of my 5 sets of skis are also Solly) boots a long time ago, and keep having great success with them today.", "It's always hard to order a shoe from an online supplier, especially when you've never worn that particular brand of shoes before. These are my first pair of Solomons and I have to say, I couldn't be happier. I'm a size 11 and they fit perfect. I had them on all day, walked up and down some pretty steep dirt hills and they felt great. all I can say is I highly recommend these boots. Great job Solomon.", "I wear these everywhere. I am not a fashion plate so Comfort is my priority. Very light comfortable. The low quarter version looks like it would be awesome as well. CON: You really have to torque the strings to keep them tied.", "good boot, but slightly too bulky for my needs, ended up going with the gortex speed cross 4, much better for out running the zombies!", "Great pair of boots that are very well built. I've been looking at them for several months, I decided to buy them and couldn't be happier with the purchase. The laces are hard to keep tied but I'm sure they will be just fine once they break in. Go for it", "Excellent pair of boots!! Kept my feet warm and dry in a very demanding environment.", "One of the most comfortable boots I have ever purchased, straight out of the box. They are awesome.", "I have flat feet and after wearing these for a couple of weeks walking 5 km a day the support is fantastic ,no ache to the feet and toe joint as I had with my sports shoes .Plenty of room in the toe area . very satisfied", "Love these boots. Noticeable difference from other boots when carrying a heavy backpack.", "Another great product from Salomon. This newer style has a revised toe box which I like better although some would argue, personal taste. Great wearing, great ankle support and love the new color of black and olive, actual goes well with jeans and a shirt.", "These had a very fast break-in period. They have enough grip, padding, and rigidity to feel confident on the rocks. They are also surprisingly light for a boot possessing all of these qualities. So far they've exceeded all expectations and I'm looking forward to seeing how they hold up against time.", "1st pair had a little seem inside which i knew immediately would cause a blister. They were returned without any issues. The second pair arrived 2 days later. They are not broken in yet as i just got them, however they seem fine.", "Fit was great. I ordered a half size larger because I wanted more toe room.very comfortable.", "The boots fit as expected and are sized properly. They are comfortable and do not leak. Stood in pooled water for over 5 minutes at work. Completely dry.", "I just received these boots a couple of days ago and as of yet have not had a chance to try them out, so my 5 stars are based soley off of first impression. Love em! Right out of the box you can tell this is a quality boot. The size I oredered fit perfect. They feel great and look great as well. Could not be happier with this purchase", "another great shoe/boot from Solomon. fits great, very comfortable awesome support for the ankle", "I cannot wait to buy another pair! One of the other instructors I work with sold me on them, I wish they had boots like these in the service! I stand all day in all weather conditions. I must say I am very, very impressed", "Wore them on a 14 mile hike out of the box. Perfect fit, no problems. Good protection for walking on trails with roots and rocks. Remarkably comfortable backpacking boot, good ankle support. Very pleased. .", "It feels like a high top basketball sneaker for hiking. They are so comfortable with next to no break-in period. You can wear them all day with no rubbing, blistering, or pain period! Aside from wearing for working or hiking you can wear them for looks because they are a nice looking boot.", "An awesome boot with a great reputation to match. Unfortunately, Salomon has a tendency to incorporate high arches in their footwear. Not knowing this, I purchased these boots only to find out that I have a medium to low arch in my left foot that effectively prevented me from wear these boots for any extended period of time. A real shame. Returning them was easy through Amazon's policy. So at least there's that.", "The box was totally coming apart when I got the package. And the shoes have little cat hairs inside them. However they do look nice and sturdy and exactly what I wanted so I will be keeping them. Just a warning about ordering on the Internet these days you never know what you're going to get.", "Great boots. Highly recommend over the Merrells that these are replacing", "I'll be wearing these boots while trekking in the Himilayas next spring but I've taken some short walks in them to break them in and they feel great. Light, breathable, they feel like a trail runner but can support a 50lb pack.", "Perfect! Feel great and every thing I hoped they would be.", "Only had these for a month or so, but so far they are comfy and fit well. I went with .5 size bigger to accommodate heavier socks. My only worry is the side buckles may break over time as I believe they are plastic.", "Yep, it's worth it. Feels like little bionic feet helping me march down the trail...lots of support, but very comfortable. Haven't needed my blue super feet inserts yet. Size note: I am on the boarder of a 13 wide, some shoes are fine 13 regular, some shows kill me, especially if I walk a lot in them. Got about 50 miles on these now and the 13 regular is just perfect, snug, supportive in all the right places, but not too tight for my boarder-line wide feet.", "My husband likes them. He wears them almost every day and I haven't heard any complaints.", "Comfortable, durable, well made. Very please with product and price.", "I will order these boots for as long as I, or this company exist. The first pair fixed my soar feet within 3 days.", "They are the ugliest boot I have ever seen, but being a function over fashion guy they are also amazingly comfortable. I would strongly recommend them and I have tried several brands even into the $300+ range and none were as great as these.", "These were a gift for my son. He loves them. Fits nicely. He wore them in the light snow we had. His feet stayed warm and dry. I wear Solomon running shoes. Great brand. They also arrived on time.", "these shoes are comfy right out of the box. i wore them about 6-7 hours the first day out of the box. this is my 3rd pair of Salomon shoes since December and i am planning on buying 1 more soon.", "I did a 12km hike with a medium pack 2 days after getting them. No blisters or hot spots. Provide support without being stiff like my leather hiking boots. As per some other reviews, the laces have a tendency to untie but that is easily sorted with a double bow. Overall, very happy!", "By far the best hiking boots ever! I had been tracking the price on these for 6 months prior to buying them. Carried a 65 pound pack with no stability issues with these boots.

Very light and sturdy, only got them recently but so far so good.", "This book have been amazing. They have been great for hiking in Moab, and through the different Utah Canyons. Good in winter and summer!", "After putting miles in my old military books it was time for an upgrade. I did a little research and found these boots. They are easy to break in and feel amazing even after wearing them all day.", "High quality boot. Still breaking them in, but they are snug and supportive. They've done well in heavy rain and puddles so far as well. Very happy with these boots.", "My son loved these boots from the first time he put them on. He only got to wear them a few times but said they were very comfortable. I'm so glad I purchased them as a gift for his hiking adventures.", "Done some pretty intense hikes in these boots and I love how they fit. Very durable and can handle crampons.", "These shoes are very comfortable, sturdy, and light. They are a bit bulky for the weight but after doing much research I don't think I would have gone with any other shoes. Very happy with my purchase. You do need to walk them around before your trip, as comfortable as they are right out of the box they are still new shoes.", "Great quality. I've worn them for a few months now. Seem to be holding up well and are very comfortable. Slightly narrow toe box for my feet.", "Excellent shoes, have used them for a weekend now, walking in snow, in wet, and dry conditions, hiking in the forest, on stony beaches. The shoes give nice support, stay dry. I used these in conjunction with thick merino wool hiking socks, and an extra pair of soles. In this setting they worked very well, with thin socks these were somewhat large.", "Paired with my Darn Tough socks the most comfortable Hike and Outdoor Experience I've ever had .....well designed.", "Absolutely great boot. I wear them all the time and have had no issues!!", "Wore these on a 9hr difficult hike in the adirondacks high peaks for the first time last weekend. I had zero blisters and my feet were comfortable the entire time (I wear Darn Tough socks get a pair). Great support as these go high above your ankle. These may be a bit heavy duty for someone looking to do nature walks.", "Overall a great pair of boots. Keep my feet warm and dry in the snow and rain so far. Have worn them all day and feet feel fine at the end of day. Certainly helpful to wear them around a little to break them in a little. Haven't had a chance to try them out as a hiking boot yet.", "Awesome boot, right out of the box. Took a little while to get use to. I did a 40 mile hike in the White Mountains - boots didn't fail, very comfortable.", "Just breaking them in. Very comfortable boots. Trudging through the snow and slush of NYC today during the blizzard. No problems. Can't wait to try them on the trails.", "I've had them a while. I wait them daily. Very comfortable. I have foot issues and have not had any flare ups wearing these.", "I would suggest considering ordering a half size up, especially if wearing heavier/thicker socks. Very comfortable right out of the box with minimal break in. Good boots.", "Lets just say that if a Genie popped out of a bottle to grant me three wishes, and I chose to use one of my wishes to equip my feet with the best hiking boots that magic, sorcery, etc. could provide, then these would be the result !!", "Comfortable enough to forget I had them on all day, I usually wear wide fit shoes that this was snug but wide enough to walk all day.", "Great fitting shoe with support around the ankles and a Achilles\u2019 tendon where I need it. I actually have it because of a partial tear of my Achilles. Doctor recommended a pair of hiking boots as part of my rehab. They\u2019re great!!!!!", "I like the shoe a lot. It has much better ankle support than the X-Ultras I had before, even though it is also much stiffer and heavier. It fits, it is predictable, and the soles are still slippery on wet rock.", "If you consider foot swelling and buy half a size bigger it will fit nicely. I'm a size 9 but 90% of my foot wear is 9 1/2 so i did the same when purchasing these. Haven't had the chance to use them, so i will update on that later.", "I've put a few miles on them now. They are comfortable and offer good ankle support. The shank works well saving the foot in rocky terrain.", "These are great, keep my feet warm in the snow and slush, and have held up well", "Best pair of shoes i have ever purchased for work. Decent protection, extremely comfortable, well made/durable. They double as my hiking boots, and are great for that as well (considering that's what they are made for i feel like that's obvious.) I will likely buy a secondary pair in the future, just to have a backup.", "This is my first pair of hiking boots. It will take a little time to break them in, but I like them a lot so far. Wish the tongue was attached to the boot higher for waterproofing. Found out that my son's Troop Scout Master has the same boots and he lives them.", "My old hiking boots finally bit the dust and good riddance! These boots are lightweight yet rugged. Minimal break-in time and totally waterproof. I wish I had these years ago.", "this was my 2nd pair. These are very comfortable, i am hard on boots, first pair lasted about a year, most of my shoes last about 4 months.", "Felt like they were a 1/2 size small. Where the boot flexes on top of your toes was uncomfortable, hoping to rectify this after returning and ordering next 1/2 size up. Otherwise they are comfortable, and very stable. Your foot does not move at all in the back half even without cinching down the laces to a stranglehold.", "Only have owned these boots for a week... Strapped them on right out of box.. Hiked the ouray perimeter geocaching... So far these boots fit well and are super comfortable... Feel like they are already broke in out of box.. Definitely will buy more once I wear these out!!!

It has been awhile since I have been hiking and I have gotten a bit heavy. These boots provide the necessary support and comfort. They came recommended to me and I can see why.", "The Saloman Quest II 4D GTX is the top rated backpackinging boot. So straight from the box i hit the trail and im delighted they performed and fit as expected. I carry a 45 to 50 lb. Pack, 90 liter. I start my year with small 5 mile trips and progress to more than 30 as i break in.", "Only have around 100 miles on them. Fit is good. Traction is great on snow, wet rocks and varied mountain terrain. Waterproofing works well. Lightweight but supportive. The insoles weren't anything special and I replaced them.

This boot is comfortable with the needed support. Light enough but provide necessary support for day hikes", "Excellent craftsmanship comfort and stability even with work day test. Outside in the natural elements is even Greater. Just bought another color.", "Love the boots.

Good traction.", "super boots, great fit support and lives up to its reputation", "second pair. best boots i have ever owned. Wore first pair hundreds of miles. Held up extremely well. Very waterproof.", "Wore them all week for a backpacking trip in the high sierras.

Sold for life.", "Great boots. Fits perfect and provides great support. I can't wait to break these in as right now they are on the stiff side.", "A quality boot in every aspect and well worth the price. The fit advice to order the same size as your regular shoe is accurate. I was contemplating going a 1/2 size larger to accommodate heavy socks, but I'm glad I trusted the Amazon's shoe fit advice. These fit perfectly out of the box and are very comfortable and sturdy.", "I recently received my boots and broke them in with a few hours of hiking with a 30# pack on my back. The boots are comfortable and so far have caused no blisters or hot spots. I'll update this review after an upcoming trip in the Rockies", "I have had two pairs of Salomon Quest 4D boots over the years, with both pairs averaging about 8 years of wear each. The fit is unbeatable as the design makes for good comfort if one is on their feet all day or for hiking.", "Fantastic boots. Very fast break-in. Light, yet supportive on ankle and arch. Locking laces enable custom tightening of lower foot and ankle independently.", "Great boot. Excellent service from Salomon when I needed to use the warranty", "Awesome shoes! Really good quality you can tell. Bought size 13 should have bought 12 because they run a little big. Not a big deal because of you where them in cold weather climates you'll have extra socks on, but I live in Florida!

Salomon wins hands down everytime in my book", "I like them so far . no comfort problems at all. waled about 5 miles and no feet problems at all", "Very comfortable boot so far. The boot seems to be stiff but I think that's a good thing for a hiking boot. Will probably soften up as I break them in more. I normally wear a size 11 in boots but I ordered a 11 1/2 and it's perfect. Plenty of room for thick wool socks.", "Hiked in these with a 60 lbs. pack without issues. Great support and zero issues (wearing 2 pairs of synthetic socks). Brought camp shoes and never needed to remove these as they were just as comfortable at the end of the day. Will buy another pair once these wear out.", "Excellent boots so far. Fit well comfortable and provide plenty of traction.", "These boots just feel like they are made tougher than other comparable priced boots. I've basically tried them all. So far I am very impressed.

I haven't hiked in them yet (just my 3rd day wearing them) but I expect them to perform nicely. I agree with others about the strings needing to be double knotted to stay tied. I would call it more like shoe rope than shoe string. I assume I could find better shoe strings if that becomes a problem when hiking.", "Only took about two-three times wearing these before they were broke-in and felt like they were made for my feet. Absolutely love these boots, and would definitely recommend.", "My husband loved these. Fit well, super cool look, non-slip hard soles.

Last year i lost both big toe nails wearing shoes my size and trying to descending mountains [they were not this brand ] No long hikes yet but short hikes love them.

I already have 50-60 miles hiked in them and I have run about two miles in them.", "Break in time is pretty short, hard to go wrong will Salomon, they've never let me down.

They are very comfortable", "For such a supportive hiking boot these are very comfortable. You can tell these are extremely high quality. The sole is very rubbery, so it might not last as long, but it will get great grip.", "Perfect Fit, quality excellent..... Can't wait to get out and hike the mountains of Pa....", "So far very happy a few weeks in, they seem like they will last well. Curious how the mesh will repel the snow this winter after they're really broken in... Used to full leather boots but these are really light and breathe much better. So far so good, if they fall apart I'll be back.", "I have not had a chance to wear boots on a long hike yet, but so far so good. Comfortable fit", "Boots fit good.

They are a little narrow across the arch and hurt my feet if I stand around on cement floors but the more I where them the more broke in they are. I hike in them every day 3 to 5 miles a day and have no problems at all with them. I think I might buy a second pare for backups.", "Nice boot! Hiked in the winter on a moderate day in the 20's and my feet were comfortable. Got them mostly for summer hiking though.", "Only did one hike with these boots so far. Carried a 40 lb pack for ten miles. I have nothing bad to report. Boots fit well and stay tight when properly tied.", "These boots are beautiful, unfortunately they are not made for wide feet!

I've worn these on several hikes in the last month and no issues. I suggest getting different laces as the ones they come with will loosen after hiking a short distance. Will be using this pair trekking in Nepal next spring.", "Love these boots. They have amazing grip. When asked how long I can comfortably wear them I had to answer a couple hours. The truth is they are comfortable to wear as long as you are moving. They only get uncomfortable when lounging or sitting around.", "These boots are light weight and extremely comfortable.

I went for 1/2 size larger than my normal shoe size to allow for normal feet swelling on long hikes. Highly recommended.", "Love these boots!

Kept my feet toasty with 1 merino wool sock at temperature of 6F, while standing in one spot for almost two hours. Been hiking with this shoe in the snow for several hours without any discomfort or pain and my feet stayed completely dry.

I had a pair of Merrells for years with more miles than I can even count on them, if it wasn't for losing those I would have never bought these boots.

Excellent traction, great ankle support, easy to change, and very comfortable.", "My fourth pair of Salomon's Quest boots. Love these boots as they fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable to wear during multi-day hikes on tough terrain. Why only three stars?

The laces need to be double-knotted as they are constantly coming untied 2. The hook that keeps the lace in place is very tight and you practically have to yank with a tight grip to get the lace out.

The soles could be a little softer and a little bigger lugs would be good for going down hill.", "After a year of light use they've been quite comfortable and keeps out water. The rubber on the outside over the toes is beginning to separate which is a bummer cuz boots usually go down hill fast when that starts and you lose the waterproof seal. I wasn't even out as much as I usually am so I'm a little disappointed. If you're looking for a workhorse this isn't it.

Very little \"break in\" time required. One thing to note about the Solomons, is they have very wide toe box. My wife has a pair as well, and we chatted with some of the guys at REI about the shoes. It's a little different to get used to, because it's tight around your whole foot except your toe area. I like it because the last thing you want when hiking are cramped toes.

I wear a size 7 ladies and I got a 6 youth which will work great with warm socks.", "This is our third pair, replaced only because of size changes. Really great boots for outdoor loving kids. My daughters wear them near daily. They have been through tons and tons of mud and have held up wonderfully. They keep them warm and dry. When they have been submerged in knee deep mud, they washed easily by hand and dried over the heater without change in shape or fit. Highly recommended!", "Great shoe! Recommend protecting them before use. Better looking and more comfortable option for a boys winter boot. Well made product as usual with Keen. Good sturdy sole, but has the typical clunk of the chunky sole. Warm and offers just the right amount of gift to wear a heavy sock, but also a thin sock without the shoe loosing its snugness. Colors are great!", "Bought these for my 7 year old to use on a ski trip. The boots look and feel nicely made. My son is picky about shoes but he liked how these fit, which was a relief because other snow shoes he tried on were too stiff for him. He also gets cold easily but these boots kept his feet warm and dry.", "my daughter wore these for 2 seasons - wore them daily October thru April - and the seams are just now starting to come undone. they are awesome. the soles are still in great condition - I may just take them to a cobbler to reinforce the seams and donate them since my daughter has out grown them.", "Great looking boot, love it. My grandson wears toddler 8, I purchased 9 and it is too small on a normal thin sock. If anyone cares, weight of 1 boot size toddler 9 is 7.7 oz (220 g), inside length is 6\u201d, widest part of sole is 3.5\u201d (looks a little bit too wide)", "I love these shoes. I have a pair that are three years old. In trying to buy a new pair, I have bought three different ones and none of them fit right! I measured them against my old pair and they look like they should fit, but they're slightly too small. My toes feel crunched inside. Another pair I bought in the same size as my old ones was a 1/2 inch too long! I don't think Keen is sticking to a sizing chart anymore.", "Ok I put \"fit as expected\" because the first time I ordered these, I ordered the same size as my son's Keen shoes--which are already a size bigger. But the boots were waaaaay too small. I ordered 2 sizes larger, and these seem to get on ok. A little loose, but he'll grow into them. So definitely, order 1-2 sizes larger than normal for your child.", "It's a bit heavy but so does all winter shoes so it's ok. My 3yr old boy chose this over other winter shoes. The material is very durable. Especially the toe kick is well protected for a toddler boy who runs around a lot.", "We purchased these for my toddler granddaughter who has very wide feet and a high arch. They are a size bigger than we would normally have purchased but they seem to do the trick. Reviews for these said that they run a bit small. She can get her foot in and out and with a thicker sock they'll be fine.", "These are nice looking and well made- however the sizing on the boots we got really confuses me. I ordered a whole size larger than my son currently wears and he says they are too small/tight. A friend also purchased these boots (same size) for her child with larger feet than my child and she has no problems.", "I got these for my almost 2 year old. He wears a size 7 right now and I got these in 8 so he would be able to wear them for the entire winter season. It's very difficult to get his foot in the shoe. You have to really jam it in there. We had these last year and they worked a bit better. Not sure why. Haven't used these in bad seasonal conditions yet. But I hope they'll perform as well as the ones last year.", "These are great boots that appear very well made, but sadly I have to return them. When you order items like this online, you rely on reviews to help you with choosing the right size based on how it fits on others. I went up a full size for my 8 yo son who wears a 5 (big kid). He is swimming in them! It appears that it might just be the toddler sizes that are running small. If your child is in the big kid sizes, I suggest ordering true to size.", "Got these for our granddaughter and she loves them. They seem to be well built and made to last, which is good as we picked a color that could be handed down to her younger brother as well. Perfect boot for our climate and weather for a little first grader.", "I love these shoes for my little guy but they are on the small, he wears a 9 and the 9s in these were almost an inch too small, I have reordered an 11, I am hoping it fits perfectly before it warms up!", "I love the boots, but they are off by an entire size at least. Ordered 8s for my daughter who wears a 6.5, after she outgrew the 7s I had bought at the beginning of the winter.", "I buy these shoes for my three boys every year. They are the perfect thing for rainy Pacific Northwest weather. They are heavy duty, but lightweight and keep my kids feet dry. Plus, they are easy on, easy off with the Velcro tab. LOVE THEM!", "My 6 yr old is so hard on shoes. I love these and so does he. They still look brand new after a few months of wearing them. (Did I mention he is hard on shoes) They also keep his feet warm and dry in the snow without having to wear is heavy snow boots. I love them!", "Based on other reviews, ordered a whole size up. The warm lining inside narrows it a bit, so sizing up allows sock allowance. These are great on my two year old and keep her toes warm and dry. They seem a little heavy but she never complained. The solid toe is a must with a toddler!", "Very cute. My kids like them. Each kid got a pair. They are a bit bulky, but I also bought a size larger than they are currently in, so that probably plays into that.", "VERY LIGHT i like them but the sizes are a little smaller than expected I took size 9 for my boy and he needs 10 with these so i will send them back and buy again. very happy seems very strong and warm", "Great shoe but the 10t was too small and the other pair too big. Grandson needs 10.5 t. The shoe looked well made.", "My son loves these boots. I bought him faux hiking boots from Carter's and he put a hole in them within a few weeks. He's tough on shoes. I decided to invest in real boots and always look to Keen for rugged and durable styles but with comfort in mind. The most annoying thing about these boots is trying to guess the size. My son wears about an 11.5 right now and I had to get a 13 for them to fit comfortably. Go up at least 1 size if not 2!", "Great shoes for winter and young kids! My son can wear these to and from the bus and school. He also can wear these all day at school. We have had these type of boots for the past three years and consider them a must have for winter. These run small but color, material are great.", "Got to try these in the snow for the first time today and they worked very well. Warm and waterproof.", "The look and colors are great, however the sizing is off. My son wears size 10 little kid, I bought size 11 of these and they were too small. Disappointed.", "Bought these shoes for my 10 year old and at first they looked great but definitely on a bulky/heavier side. Kid wore it for about a week and the bottom sole started to slowly un-glue from the top portion of the shoe so we've decided to return these shoes. Rather disappointed with overall durability of these shoes.", "My daughter has slightly wide feet, so Keens are a great fit for her. She is pretty picky about shoes but she loves these ankle boots!", "Did fit large, but I love the quality. My son loves these shoes and is easy for him to put on.", "I am taking away one star for being a bit bulky. My daughter got used to it and likes wearing them we are yet to test it in the snow!! Will update once we do! Shoes are very well made and seems to be warm and comfy just what we needed.", "Love the material. They are warm and comfortable. They look durable .gr8 buy", "I am buying these boots for 2 years in a row for my son. They seem to be comforyable and warm enough for NYC, but not too heavy or bulky. He must wear sneakers to school, and these boot were comfortable both indoors and outside.", "I like the boots, but they run somewhat wide and bulky. My 10 years old son was tripping while trying them on and walking a little bit around the room. Also, they are kind of girly looking. Had to return.", "These are the best shoes I ever bought for my son. And they're his favorite . I bought another pair since, for my other son. They're so sturdy and well made. Best quality !", "Love these boots! Stylish, warm, waterproof, and easy to slip on quickly!", "nice waterproof leather, good quality. Runs somewhat small, and boots are somewhat hard.", "This is our third Pair of Keen shoes in this style. They are a bit heavy but offer great protection in cold climates. My son is very picky with shoes/boots and he loves these. The rubber tip is rugged and protects the feet in both rain and snow, and is excellent on playgrounds. These shoes last forever! And they ARE comfortable as far as shorts boots go. I buy them a size bigger that his regular size and they always fit just right (over a slightly thicker winter sock).", "Good quality and great fit. I took a size bigger - my girl is size 7 and I bought 8 just to have a little extra room. She loves them! I was afraid it will be bulky and heavy and they are not. Great buy", "I have ordered my son a pair of these 4 yrs in a row. He loves them!", "Bought these for my 5 year old - he absolutely loves them. Heavier then his sneakers, but he can run and play comfortably. He says they are very warm and comfy. Easy to get on and off is a bonus.", "Too hard to get the feet in. Even if you get your feet in, you can't walk because they are too tight. Both kids refused to wear them after trying them on and asked me to return them to \"prime\".", "These boots are awesome. They are a staple in my sons winter wardrobe. He swears they are just as comfortable as his tennis shoes. They are our go to boot!!!", "Way too heavy and inflexible for toddler feet. Well made though. Had to return.", "This shoe is perfect especially for my child who does not know how to ties his shoe laces yet. Strong and durable shoes.", "wonderful colours... expected keen fit and finish... size 6 fits my women's 7 1/2 feet just fine... super fun in soggy weather", "GREAT BOOTS. Limited Ankle support which makes me very nervous. i try to strap the Velcro as tight as possible. these Boots should have ties with how heavy duty they are. Great boots overall!", "Durable warm kids boots. Perfect for preschool playing in the fall and winter on the playground", "Great, waterproof boots that don't produce the heat of tall boots, yet keep out moisture. These are our go-to winter shoe choice!", "Bought these for a two year old. They were not really too small, but it's really hard to get their foot in the shoe. I love Keens, and always buy for my granddaughters in the summer. These look really nice, but way too difficult to put on.", "i wanted to love these, but they were too wide for my girls, who have low volume feet. the quality is fantastic, though.", "what a great shoes for little explorers. i bought those for my 2yr old daughter. These shoes kept her warm and dry throughout the fall/winter season of New England weather. highly recommend.", "Had these for my now three year old last year and loved them. Perfect fall/winter all weather boots. Keene are the best!", "the shoe itself is great warm but the size is to small. my daugther is size 9 1/2 i ordered a 10 it fit her just right but i returned it because i needed room for thicker socks and room to grow", "Looks good so far. My so. Haven\u2019t try it yet.", "I love this little boots but the size runs way too small. I order 2 sizes bigger for my girl and they still don't fit. She normally wears a 1 to 1.5 and so I order a 3 and they did not fit. way to small.", "Awesome! Bought for a camping trip -- worked great and we are still using them for hiking and fishing and all that good stuff that kids go and do.", "I really like these shoes. They don't really work for snow play because they are not high enough but they do work for running errands, etc.", "Previous years have been great. This year is NOT water proof.", "I have bought a pair of these Keen Winter Boots for my grandson for the last 3 years. They are comfortable, light weight and yet hold up great- easy for them to get on and off! Would highly recommend them- worth the price", "Great shoes will enjoy them when snow come. I recommend buying them.", "Not the warmert but certainly the coolest snow boots. Easy to slip on.", "Have held up very well so far on my little guy.", "Great looking boot. Like others have said: sizing is way off. Size 9 kootenay insole is same length as size 8 stride rite insole (but the toe box is wider on the keen). Other than sizing being off, it's a great shoe!", "These shoes are really great! Warm, comfy, and totally waterproof. The only drawback is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but I guess you can't do better for a snow boot.", "Good quality but why so wide? They make my four year olds feet like unnaturally wide.", "My son had a similar pair when he was 3 - 4 yo and they still looked great after he had out-grown them. I was excited to see the same boot in his size as a 9 yo. They're stylish, durable and work well for that winter boot just below the level of big snow boots.", "Confotable. Not cute for girl. But I want her to have confortable and warm shoes to go to school.", "This is my grandson's second pair. He loves them. They are sturdy and comfortable in all kinds of weather.", "It's a good boot, I can say instead of shoes. Easy to wear and easy to taking off. My son love it very much. The out sole is durable and avoid slip. Believe KEEN's quality. Will go and see the performance in winter weathers.", "My son is 3 years old and his sizes is 7 and I order sizes 8 it was exactly but the shoes is great comfortable and warm", "love these boots. easy to put on and off, keeps dry, warm, and comfortable. cute and very durable.", "Love the looks the fit the comfort everything about this shoes", "The best winter shoes for my boy! We love these shoes and wear them each day.They have withstood rain, snow, mud and countless outdoor adventures!", "True wide!!!! So great for my 5 yo! he's a 3xw and these were great", "Mert my expectations, just because it has some like plush inside it will need to buy one size bigger than you need", "Great little shoe, we just didn't get any snow this year", "Bought these for my 4 yo and they are a nice simple weatherproof boot. He seems to love them. Fuzz and warm with Keen reinforced toe.", "These shoes are great. My son found them comfortable, but just a bit big. They are a very good shoe for the price.", "The size was as expected. My daughter loves the color. I only buy Keen brand for my kids because they have wide feet.", "Keen's are amazing my kids wear out shoes like no ones business but keen's are indestructible I have to buy new ones only cause they out grow them and they still look almost new it's crazy we love them", "They are warm, easy to put on and completely adorable!", "Super nice boots! Cushioned foot bed. Seems like they would be very warm!", "Wow, my son LOVES these boots! He stomped around with them for days, excited to have boots \"like Daddys!\" Ive found they seem to be just as comfortable as sneakers + easy for him to put on + take off. They are perfect!", "Great, warm and comfortable boots! Keen is unbeatable! Very pleased!", "Way too small, even though we bought one size up.", "Very cute and stylish !! Grandson just loved them !!!", "My 2 y.o. wore them every day for several months. We leave in Seattle, so our winder is relatively mild but wet. These boots are perfect for our climate, warm enough without being too warm and waterproof for everyday rain. They are very easy to put on and off, so a 2 y.o. could do it by himself. Shame kids feet grow fast, these boots are very study and durable and will last a few seasons of everyday wear. If you have more than one kid, they are a fantastic investment even at full price.", "I love them they are just what I wanted great In the snow. so easy to get on", "Great solid shoe, pricey for a kids shoe but worth it.", "This is our 4th season of purchasing this shoe and it do not disappoint! It's very durable, looks great long term and is very comfortable according to my 10 year old! Well worth the money.", "I purchased these a size larger knowing that I was going to place an insert for the support of my son's flat feet.", "Second pair for my son, a size bigger than last winter. The only boots that fit his high instep. After the whole season of hard wear the first pair looked almost like new and was handed to a younger friend.", "Buy them because a was going for or trip on january 22 to Hollywood studios, we had a very cold and rainy day for January 23 2016 where the weather in Magic kingdom was 6 centigrade. My 3 years old boy had a good time I didn't worry a bit. We returned 11am with a very cold weather . I'm a 100% satisfied customer.", "What great quality! Looking to see how they hold up to a 5 year old boy lol But looks like I've got nuthing to worry about Looking to get him more .", "We love these shoes for my kids! They are the best shoes for snow and cold weather. Great on icy areas. My son outgrows these before they even have any signs of wear. These are so well made!", "Really nice great quality only thing is the size was a little small. My daughter being 3 likes to be in anything messy. She got the new size went to the dog park played in puddles came home rinsed off and still dry inside and her feet were warm. We will be getting these again.", "My daughter doesn't like her feet to be overly warm.

My daughter is pleased and referred to the as \"solid\". Keen is always a good product for everyone regardless of age!", "Really nice boots but too small I read other reviews so I ordered a size larger but did not fit.

Sadly I had to send them back", "Wonderful boots. Both my grandsons love them. Easy to put on and take off, warm and comfy.", "These are amazing winter shoes...warm (for our cold Canadian winters), waterproof and most of all comfortable. I get these for day to day wear and the bulky winter boots for outside play.", "Keen is the only toe box wide enough for my boy. Loved them so much over the last several years both boys now wear them. These are pretty durable. The velcro is the only thing we ever had an issue with, but not enough to deter anouther purchase. Own their sandals, koven and several of these boots. Would recommend. They have fit true to size for 8 year old but I buy bigger for 10 year old that has a wider foot.", "im happy to have purchased these Keen boots for my 4 year old. They do run small. He's a size 11 but I ordered a 12 and they fit him nicely with just a little extra room. He loves them and can put them on himself and do the Velcro strap. Keen is a well known brand, reputable, waterproof and it's a very nice looking boot. I purchased the brown. My only concern is that his feet get hot in the boot and I don't see odor shield protectant as in some other kids shoes. Otherwise, I would look to purchase this brand again.", "Bought Keen boots for my 4 year old. Very sturdy, durable footwear. This is my second pair of Keen Kootenay for him, and I am very happy with my purchase!", "Love them! I have Keen women boots and love them, so I went looking for a pair for my son. These are amazing. Wider fit which is great for my son's wide feet. soft supporting bottom, flexible. Water proof and warm. My son loves wearing them. These are the 2nd pair. When he grows out of them, I will buy a size up.", "This is our second time ordering this style of boots for our son. I am always impressed by the quality and comfort of Keen's. Would definitely recommend these boots!", "The front rubber part came lose after wearing just 3 times.... :(", "If you have ever owned a pair of Keen's you know the quality of their products, outstanding. This is the third pair of children's Kootenay winter boots that I've purchased for my kiddo and he loves them and I definitely love them too. Before we had these boots, I had him wear those huge, half-way up the leg snow boots. It was so hard for my kiddo to get around in those clunkers!", "Great Shoes for my little guy. They are comfortable to play both outdoors or indoors, and keep his little feet warm in the snow. They ARE truly waterproofed, as he has played with them in the heavy snow, but his feet have never gotten wet. I have found that we have not been using snow boots now that he wears these shoes. He loves them, and wants to wear them all the time. The Velcro closure makes it easy for him to put on and take off. I highly recommend.", "I have been using the shoes of Keen for mu son. I am very content with them. They are terrific!", "My daughter loves these shoes. Warm, comfy, easy for her to put on and off herself.", "order 1 size up. it was too small for our kid.", "I love the quality of Keen in this cute winter boot.", "As I wanted them! But needed them obe size bigger than usual.", "Bought for my 7 year old. He likes them, they do run a bit large though. The toe box is very wide. Seems like they are well made.", "This is the third pair that we have purchased for our son who is now nearly 5 years old. He' s been wearing this particular shoe since he was 2! These are slightly wide shoes, which has been great for his feet. They are sturdy, weather and water proof, good looking and easy for him to put on himself. Our favorite kid's shoe by far!!", "Nice shoes. My 8 years old son like it very much.", "I love these shoes on my toddler. But the sizing is all off. My advise would be to go up 2 sizes. They are expensive enough and they work. They keep my little ones feet warm and dry. I like these over the water resistant ones, I'll spend the extra $ on these. But then I live in a rainy climate so waterproof is necessary. They are a little tricky to get on, but I think it's getting easier the more she wears them. They do look cute with a dress. I ordered the next size up as well for probably next month when she outgrows these ones.", "For my 3 year old toddler... I should have ordered the next size up.

Comfortable Lightweight option Requires minimal break-in Offers a long-lasting sole that grips well They run a bit narrow and the toe box is a little cramped We recommend buying up a half-size Some buyers have noted that this boot wears out more quickly than others", "source_documents": ["Entire chunks of the sole started cleaving off after having had the boots for just over a year and having worn them for less than 30 miles. Generally in my experience Vasque's quality has been high but these things are absolutely pathetic. I wouldn't recommend buying these boots. I tried working with Amazon and Vasque on a return/exchange. Vasque/RedWing wants me to mail the boots back to them on my dime, which I feel is unwarranted since this is clearly a defect in their rubber, and Amazon indicates the boots are beyond their return window. Don't waste your money on these.", "One thing I think every backpacker would agree on is that foot comfort comes first. I hike the Appalachian Trail mostly. It is a fairly rough trail and really puts boots to the test. This pair of boots feel like they were custom made for me. Straight out of the box there were no odd feelings or pressure points and they required no break-in (although I did wear them about one hundred miles before I hiked with them). After 80 miles on a very rocky part of the AT my feet felt great, the best I've ever experienced! They are very water resistant and light weight too. I love them!", "Virtually no break in period. Although I ordered 13 W they are a bit narrow. No room for extra socks or thicker/wool type. Surprisingly light on my feet not clunky. Hopefully they last, using for work, on my feet a lot. The soles are Vibrams and I don't feel alot of under foot issues. In other words, good traction, pebbles not collecting, etc, etc. If they slide in another direction in the next 3_6 weeks I will update.", "I've owned 5 pairs of Vasque Breeze boots over the past 15 years. I love them, they are the most comfortable shoes I own. No break in required. They are comfortable from the very first time you wear them. Now for the bad. I wish they would last longer. The previous 4 pairs started to fall apart at about 2 1/2 to 3 years of use (Estimate 800 miles). The sole starts to come apart. We'll see how long this 5th pair last. If you don't mind replacing your boots every 2-3 years (depending on your uses), then they are great boots.", "The boot is great but I have two major problems with it. First, it is NOT waterproof. It is much closer to being very water resistant. Prolonged exposure to water, especially above the toe box will lead to damp feet. They will however keep your feet from becoming drenched. These are best for short stream crossings not walking through a stream. This is mostly a Gore-Tex problem and not a Vasque problem. Secondly, they are SLIPPERY on wet rocks. These boots are just good enough to not warrant the hassle of returning them and trying something else. I will keep them but will look elsewhere for the next pair.", "I first ordered the regular width boot and found it to be too narrow. I returned the boot and ordered a wide boot. Overall, I am very happy with these boots and am now in my second year of wearing them. The waterproof aspect works very well as my feet have stayed dry after walking in the snow. My last pair of Vasque boots lasted about 5 years and it looks like these will easily last at least 5 years. I will buy these again.", "These are my go to everyday shoe for town or trail. They are very comfortable and provide great support. I have owned at least 4 pairs. Goretex version does run a little bit warm in summer. The rubber heels and soles are durable but they will wear down. When they do, I have them resoled locally to extend their useful life. (sometimes just the heel / half sole) . Medium width does run a little narrow which suits me just fine. Good value...especially on sale.", "Outstanding quality and fit. We didn't even have to break these in before we took them on a 100 mile, 2 week backpack trip in the mountains. Climbed several peaks and hiked over every type of terrain. Not a single hot spot or blister (paired with hiking socks and liners). These felt lighter and a bit less clunky than the Solomon's our other family members had (which were also fantastic boots!). I would buy these again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended.", "I bought these boots and put about 10-15 miles on walking a day. I have had them less than two months (delivered August 25 today is October 14) and the soles are wearing down already, the insides have started to break down and the shoelaces (albeit minor issue) require triple knots to stay tied through out the day. I will not be purchasing another pair, that is for sure. I am just frustrated two months in and I am already starting the search for new boots.", "These boots are fantastic - best boots I've ever worn - bar none. I had plantar fasciatis so bad I could hardly walk at all and these boots were an integral part of curing that. They aren't inexpensive, but I'm hard on equipment and these boots last 2-3 years being worn every single day. Eventually you wear out the sole, but the rest of the boot is still going strong. The Gore tex version is good and waterproof, as well as breathing well. The only thing you need to know is they run about 1/2 size small. Otherwise, they are perfect!!!", "Very unsatisfied with this product and trying to determine if I am going to send back. I love the style of boot for work but I have wore these a couple times in the fronts are stretching out so badly it feels like I'm wearing flip-flops. Not a great product very disappointed", "I have been buying vasque boots since 1995 and they have never let me down. Comfortable and perfectly sized, waterproof but breathable. Great to wear, nice to look at, unique and amazing tread design. These boots are not insulated but do a good job of staying warm (Pacific NW snow/ice) without being constrictive. Lightweight yet heavy duty. A great buy.", "I loved my last set of Vasque boots. Over 20p miles of Backcountry and never had a blister or any complaints/discomfort. I bought these hoping I'd get the same support but lighter. I've gotten my first blisters ever and they really jack up Achilles Tendon. They are still in great condition and think I need to just toss them", "These boots are awesome! My husband has worn Asolo, Keens, Danner, etc but has really enjoyed this 1st pair of Vasque boots. He loves that they are light weight but super sturdy. The gore-tex and lining makes them completely waterproof up to the ankle which is great for walking through all sorts of terrain. The color is great too. I like the black/gray instead of the brown because with jeans it looks more like a shoe and less like a dorky hiking boot. It makes this hiking boot a little more versatile for my outdoor-loving hubby. The price on these was amazing especially compared to other hiking boots and they shipped quickly. We for sure recommend these Vasque brand boots!", "Was looking into various boots like Solomon and others but my problem is that most of them comes in regular size and I needed little wider model. Not sure what to expect out of Vasque but I am pleasantly surprised that it surpassed my expectations. I bought this boots specifically for my trip to Everest Base Camp and broke in a month ago and the shoe more than withheld the rocky trails at EBC. Interestingly I saw lot of trekkers wearing Vasque during my trip. Great product I guess.", "I bought a pair of Vasque boots a few years ago on clearance at REI before going to Afghanistan for work. Those boots were awesome in snow/slush/heat, but alas, after 6 years of almost daily use, they finally wore out. I decided to jump on Amazon and buy a new pair (note: this is my first pair of boots purchased online). The size is exact as my old pair to my delight. These new boots are slightly lighter and super comfortable, no real break in period needed.", "These are by far the best hiking boots I have ever purchased. I just rolled my ankle pretty bad recently so I needed some ankle high boots for extra support just in case. I don't know how they design the tread on the bottom, but I literally didn't even slip once while doing Angels Landing in Utah. Or I never felt my feet were not securely gripping the ground. The grip on these boots are the main selling point for me. The next items which are great features are that they are waterproof and are comfortable. Feet did not hurt or feel sore at all after a long hike. Also fit as expected.", "I loved how comfortably they fit right out of the box, and the initial break-in period was very short. I do wish they were a little heavier duty and offered more ankle support - but that's partly due to my mistake. An REI salesperson had told me that they were Vasque's entry level boot. I am starting to hike again after a long hiatus, so I thought that would be ok, but in retrospect my previous hiking experience and weight (220 lb, 5'10\" male) was enough that I should have looked more seriously at heavier weight boots. I may need to replace these sooner than I would have liked for that reason.", "This is only a preliminary review as I've only just purchased these. In the breaking in period I love these boots. I tried them on elsewhere so I knew the sizing would be good. The correct size for me ended up being a size up from my normal shoe size. They feel great so far and have decent ventilation. For everyday use I normally wear my Birkenstocks because my feet get wicked hot. So far that's not a problem I notice with these until I'm ready to take them off. These are made very well and I can't wait to really put them to the test this late spring.", "Having owned and loved a pair of the first version of these boots, I was hoping that the second version would prove to be just as comfortable. After 100+ miles in these boots, I can now confirm that they're just as great as the originals. While I admit that I haven't had a chance to test them for complete waterproofness, they hold up to moderate rainfall and mud puddles with no issue and the traction is great on dry rocks. The only things I could ask for would be a stiffer shank (for rock hopping) and rands for mounting crampons, but then you'd be getting into the realm of mountaineering boots and not just hikers..", "They are a great hiking boot, but they are a little shorter then the sizing chart given. They did give me blisters if I wore them for more then a few hours or if I wore them on a difficult hike. I love that they are gortex and they actually are, they are completely dry all the way to the top of the boot, the down side of the boots being gortex is that they do not breath at all. My feet were very sweaty every time I wore these boots.", "I bought these for my boyfriend and he wears them as a daily shoe. They are very comfortable but the waterproofing has failed in less than a year. If he walks through wet grass then his socks become soaking wet. I\u2019m hoping that the replacement pair will last longer.", "I save a couple of hours only hours only because I broke my foot a year ago, and I need to break them in. My old ones I can wear all day. These boots are great for support. The only shoes I can wear without pain that lasts for weeks (went to a wedding in my oxfords, and it took that long to recover). I bought new ones to wear at my wedding, believe it or not - dark gray was the closest to black. Oh, they are excellent hiking boots, which I do too. Long hikes through the forest, or the city streets, or the park.", "Great comfortable waterproof boots. These are for light hiking. If you replace the inserts with a hard-arch orthotic then in my opinion they're fine for moderate loads/distances. I'd look elsewhere if you need something really heavy-duty. For those that need something relatively light for camping/fishing these are fantastic.", "Fantastic boots. I used these boots on my hiking trip through Desolation Wilderness on the South side of Lake Tahoe. I have small ankles, and I'm pretty damn sure these boots saved me from a couple of potential rolled ankles. Held up great in the rain too. I did break them in a little before going on my hike, but once broke in, I was able to hike 12 miles comfortably. I'm considering buying a second pair, just to have ready for the future someday.", "I bought my first pair more than 4 years ago. Despite our Brittany taking quite a liking to the leg cushioning on the uppers of both pair, they have worn like iron. I think we pulled an eyelet out of one pair but that was after more than 4 years of very rough wear. The dog probably help with that as well. The first two pair were bought in a \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d store known for their quality product. They pushed this footwear and I\u2019m glad they did. Great footwear!", "Boot is light and fits like a glove right out of the box. Very good support and very comfortable. The uppers hold up very well, just wished the Vibram sole wore better. I wear these every day and walk 3-5 miles a day. The soles wear through the bottom layer in about 8 - 9 months... so around 1000 - 1200 miles in the tread.", "I've only worn them for about 10 miles, but I stood in a very cold creek about 4 inches deep for 3 or 4 minutes and they didn't leak. If it doesn't say Gore-Tex it's not really waterproof. These boots are very comfortable right out of the box. I bought them 1/2 size larger to accommodate boot socks and sock liners to prevent blisters. It works great. I would highly recommend these boots to anyone.", "The fit was as expected and very comfortable right out of the box. I have always hiked in Vasque and order them because they last a long time and I have never had a seam fail or the sole detach. Great boots!!", "This is a legitimate review. I bought this boots for two primary reasons- first to replace my Northface shoes which are great shoes but not waterproof and second for the reliability of the Vasque Brand. These boots were immediately comfortable on my feet and my first try out was a seven mile uphill rocky climb in a local state park that involved some minor stream crossing. The boots performed great and kept my feet dry. My only complaint is that they are a little \"clunky\" feeling and don't have the hugger feeling the Northface boots have. I'd recommend these are decent waterproof boots.", "I have purchased Vasque boots for 40 years and have always gotten the same size boot and the fits have been good. One of the pairs was a hiking shoe I purchased less than 6 months ago and its fit was good. Now, the pair I purchased under this order is too narrow. I question the current quality control. The most recent shoes came from two different countries of origin. I will probably no longer purchase shoes/boots online and question my loyalty to Vasque.", "was to small, this is the second pair this model and it was to tight, even in the wide width. 3 stars for inconsistent sizing.(product review part) ~~ could not do an even exchange for the next 1/2 or full size up. had to return and repurchase at a higher price... Amazon would get a 1.5 star for poor handling of exchange return.(Amazon customer service review part)", "This is my fourth pair of vasque breeze boots in twelve years. They have all been great for regular hiking and chores around the house. This latest pair seem to be as well made as all the rest. Only problem is either my foot has gotten wider or the boot has gotten narrower. I have always gotten a size 8 medium but this time I should have gone wider. I love these boots and maybe they will stretch out a bit. I would recommend them but if you order a pair you might want to go up a half size or go for the wide width.", "Beware -The Vibram sole on this boot is very low quality. I received this on Sunday April 10 th. Went on a 3 mile hike to check fit and break in the boot. Now on Monday April 11th I am returning due to the sole loosing chunks of rubber. It is crazy to think that Vasque has not corrected this issue. Love the fit and weight of these boots, but can't imagine the shape they would be in months from now.", "Outstanding waterproof hiking boot. This is my second pair, the first I wore for a season and suffered through too small a size. If you get these boots I highly recommend you go up a FULL size (at least for men). I normally wear a 10 1/2 US, but my latest pair is 11 1/2 US and it fits perfectly. We just completed an 18 mile trek through Dolly Sods in West Virginia; every trail looked more like a stream bed. My feet never got wet.", "Boots seem to be well made, but I couldn't say for certain. Had to return, too small. I typically wear a 11.5 or 12, standard width. Ordered up a size 12. Just a bit tight across the ball of my foot, and definitely too short. My toes were at the end of the boot. Vasque boots have always fit me well. Haven't decided on ordering up a size 13. Worry that they will be too large.", "I really like these boots. Although when I first got them they felt as though they had no arch support. I figured I'd remedy that by adding my own insoles. And even though I ordered the wide size, they were uncomfortably narrow on my feet. But then again I'm rather duck footed. Another issue I had with them was a slight leak in one of the boots. But that was only after I purposefully stood in some water to test them. I didn't find any dampness after wearing them in the snow during the winter however. Overall I really like these and would probably order them again. If you're considering a pair of these, keep in mind the width.", "I loved these boots so much that I purchased a second pair so that I wouldn't wear them out as fast. The sole and grip is fantastic, plus they provide great support for your foot and ankle. A little pricey but you get what you pay for.", "The Vasque Breeze is a good summer boot, cool in hot weather and waterproof enough for a quick stream crossing. They fit comfortably out of the box. This last pair is my second in 3 years. I estimate that I hiked around 1000 miles in the first pair the sole of which separated in places from the plastic mid-sole. Shoe-goo repairs finally reached their limit. In both pairs I added arch supports which worked fine.", "Based on other reviews, I understood that these run a bit shall, so I adjusted my order accordingly and ordered 1/2 size larger than normal. I have used these boots twice, on a 6-mile hike and as a marshal in a local pro golf tournament on a heavily rainy day. The boot are very comfortable, light weight, they gave me good traction on wet grass and kept my feet dry for hours, in the heavy rain. I'm very pleased with these boots and would recommend them to anyone who wants a high quality, waterproof hiking boot.", "I took these boots out on their first trip this weekend to Copperas Falls in Red River Gorge, Kentucky. If anyone is familiar with this unmarked trail then they know there is about a dozen or so water crossing. Not one drop of water got into my boot and essentially zero break in time. These boots don't have the best ankle support but you can't ask for everything in such a lightweight hiking boot. Regardless I'm very please with these boots. Only time will tell how these boots hold up but as of right now they're 5* quality. I will update this review in around another 100 miles or so. I", "Great hiking boots. I have gone as far as 10 miles in these with a 40 lb pack. I did not get any hot spots or chafing the whole time. And only relaced maybe once. The traction is amazing. the ankle support is great for anyone with a pack. And they only lace up the bottom portion through eyes. the rest is hooks. So when you take a break is takes seconds to let your feet breathe.", "Used as a secondary boot for hiking, especially when feet are sore and need relief from stiffer boots. Best aspect is they are supple while still offering great hiking boot support and protection from water.", "I fell in love with Vasque about 6 years ago. They were recommended by a hiking friend. So I bought a pair and have literally put thousands of miles on them. They are still comfortable to this day. I bought these as their replacement and immediately noticed they were not as comfortable. While some of this is the tightness of a new boot, they don't have the same amount of padding as their predecessor - especially around the ankle and tongue. All in all, I still like them, but disappointed they don't make them like they used to.", "I have only worn these for a few days around the house and to work, about 40hrs total. They feel almost perfect. I got 9.5EE and they are just slightly too narrow at the widest point at front where the toes begin. However this isn't an issue for me since I have access to a shoe stretcher and only needs to be widened very slightly. The length was perfect. I plan to start using these for light hikes starting this weekend. I am hoping to get many years of light duty out of these as I have had great experience with Vasque in the past.", "This boot is very comfortable! It requires almost no break-in! Pretty much trail ready out of the box! Gore-Tex works wonderfully against the elements (briefly even submerged lower part of boot up to ankle and no entry of H2O!) I have taken this boot on a backpacking trip to Red River Gorge in Kentucky as well as hiking locally and has always been super comfortable! No water leaking in even when stepping in a stream briefly and keeps feet dry in wet grass 100% of time! Have not tried in snow but will later this year. I would recommend this boot to anyone avid hiker or backpacker! Well worth every penny!", "I love these boots. The fit is perfect - something to celebrate for me as I'm a woman who wears a Ladies size 11. I have had these for a while now, long enough that they're getting nicely broken-in. I've worn them hiking around Southeast Alaska and in the Yukon and am impressed with the traction, light weight, and durability. I'll definitely consider another pair of these...if the ones I have ever wear out.", "I bought the Vasque Breeze 2.0 GTXWaterproof Hiking Shoe as a replacement for an older pair that has many, many miles on them. In ordering them I noted the reviews that talked about ordering a half size larger than your normal shoe size. I had forgotten about this in the past and looked at my older Vasque shoes and noted that they were indeed a half size larger. I ordered the larger size and they fit perfectly. One other note, the Amazon price was considerably lower than what I had seen at a number of places and on line. These are great hiking shoes and I recommend then to anyone!", "Nice looking hiking boot. Very comfortable right out of the box. Going from relatively flat soled every day shoes to these makes your step certainly feel \"springy\"! Fit was just right and same size as my \"every day\" shoes. These look well constructed and should last quite some time. They will see the trail in a month or so to give them the full test.", "The wide was not wide at all. In fact it was narrower than a previous Vasque I purchased which was normal width. I can't imagine how narrow this boots normal width is like. However, it appears to be well constructed with a hefty sole. So after my first hike with it I give it 5 stars. The fit actually was much better than I thought. After hiking for a mile it just became more and more comfortable just like my old Sundowners use to be. Incredible support yet not stiff. After 4 hours not one hotspot at all which is rare for me.", "This is the fourth pair of these hiking boots I buy, one on replacement of the other one. If for any reference, these boots last up to 400 Km. I have tracked them with my Garmin GPS on every hike I made over the last few years. Somehow this new pair (Size 10 like all of its predecessors) ran a little bit narrow, or, I would say, a little bit uncomfortable, don't know why. I will wear them a little to see if it improves.", "When I first received these Vasque boots, I was thrilled. Extremely comfortable, gore-tex worked perfectly for hiking in wet country and light snow. But here is my big disappointment -- my previous pair of Vasque boots lasted over 20 years and never really wore out, the sole just finally delaminated. But now, just over a year later, all the heel lugs are worn \"down to the gray\" and I have to replace these. What happened?", "I just went on an 11 day elk hunt. We did a lot of hard hiking up, down, and around hills. I wore these everyday from sun up to sun down and my feet never hurt once. Was much better than I could have ever expected. It rained one day and my feet never got wet. Temperatures ranged from some the 20s in the morning to 70s some afternoons and I didn't have trouble with my feet getting to hot or cold with a pair of wool socks. This was some of the best money I have ever spent on some footwear.", "I prefer a midheight boot for general wear and day hiking but find that a lot of fabric and synthetic leather or suede boots don't provide enough support or last very long. These Breeze GTX boots are lightweight, rugged, and supportive. I have low volume feet and used to fit in 10 1\\2 narrow boots but since I've gotten older, my foot has lengthened and my size is now 11. I ordered these GTX boots based on other reviews and the length is perfect and the size is as claimed. I just added another set of thin footbeds and the fit is about as perfect as in any boot that I've ever owned.", "I clicked 10.5 D and instead a 10.5 N got placed in my basket for checkout, and I did not notice it and checked out. When I received the box, I still did not notice it said \"N\" and tried them on and that's when I noticed right away they were too narrow, but they did feel great on my feet. The good part is Amazon is amazingly easy to return items too. Thanks Amazon", "This boot is my first real hiking type boot and I've greatly enjoyed it this winter in Iowa. Looking forward to seeing how it performs on trails this summer! Pros: Lightweight Accent colors are subtle Vibram sole is flexible yet tough. Cons: Rubs a little on the outside of my pinkie toes. I have slightly wider feet than normal width though. Gusset doesn't come up to the top of the boot. Wearing shorter socks, you can sometimes feel the breeze if the top lugs aren't tied.", "After some struggle to get the correct size these boots were very comfortable from the start. Used them to hike in Welsh mountains 8-9 miles a day. They are lighter than other brands and this is helpful when traveling. My only concern is that they seemed A little slippery when underfooting was was wet (muddy), but overall these were a good purchase. Lacing system easier than some previous brands, and works well. Waterproofing good.They definitely run small and I needed 1/2 size bigger than usual.", "I love these boots. I've worn Vasque for years and these are my favorite. They breathe well enough to be wearable in Florida summer weather. Breaking in was minimal, though after two days they became even more comfortable. Water resistance has not yet been tested, though because of the breathable design I'd not expect them to be as water resistant as all leather. But then, the breathability is one reason I bought them.", "Very comfy and nice looking upon arrival. Outer of shoe is holding up good. Insole or sole area breaking down fast. Have had about 2 months. Feels like I can feel the tread or something through the insole!! Disappointing at best!", "I usually hesitate buying shoes online but these were such a good deal I went for it and I'm glad I did! This is my first pair of Vasque's , I order 8 1/2 w and they fit perfectly and are very comfortable. They have good arch and ankle support which is a must for me, Overall they are an extremely well made pair of boots, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and I'm sure that I will be purchasing more Vasque Boots in the future!", "I had an earlier version of this shoe that fit perfectly, so with the sole wearing off of it, I decided to order the newest version. It fits well and feels good on my feet. I expect that I will get the same excellent service out of this shoe as I have previously.", "I love these boots. I've had them for about three months now and have hiked extensively with them on numerous trails including the CT and even climbed Pike's Peak (14,200') with them. I have no complaints. They do a good job keeping my feet dry and comfortable, including good ventilation. I will definitely buy another pair if this pair ever dies (which will probably take a long time because the quality is that good)!", "These boots are good quality, typical of Vasque. The side venting is great for warm weather. They seem to be durable and the fit is nearly true to size. Great prices. My only concern is that the tread, which has two ovals in the middle, may not be aggressive enough, especially for steep or rocky trails. The ovals do not provide the slip prevention that more traditional patters do. If you are buying these for mostly grass, dirt or paved trails, they should be great.", "GREAT BOOTS! These are perfect for long hikes in rugged terrain. I've worn them on very demanding 10 hour hikes in the Colorado Rockies and they've stood up to a significant beating. Lives up to the Vasque reputation. I have the old style leather Vasque boots and love them as well, but they are so heavy. These are a great lighter version that will give you many miles of good solid support. I did put in custom insoles, however, because the factory insoles are not ever quite good enough for long demanding hikes.", "So true length/my size based on size chart is accurate. I got a wide version but it doesnt feel wide, feels tight out of box, will add to this review in a few days of breaking them in. Ankle support very good though.", "These are my new favorite hiking shoes. I did get blisters to start which is normal when breaking in any new and stiff shoe. But once broken in these boots really feel nice. I have to wear a couple pair of socks but after that these really feel comfortable. I have already hiked a couple of 5000 footers and even a 6000 foot hike with no problems. Just give yourself a good long breaking in period. These are very nice looking boots and well built. I am extremely pleased with them.", "Comfortable and light and good looking. I have been wearing this almost every other day for the last couple of weeks and they are very comfortable...no more sore feet...It took about 3 days of wearing to break in/get used a more snug feel due to laces because most of my shoes are slip-ons.", "The boot fit as expected and is comfortable right out of the box. I have not had time to test on a trail yet as spring has been extremely elusive in Northern NH this year but with a mild hiking sock and some trail time I can only believe they will continue to perform well.", "Didn't fit well for me. The normal size were not wide enough and my pinky toes were being crushed. I got a 2E and my pinky still rubs a but it was so wide, it wouldn't lace correctly anymore. Other than that, it was excellent. I highly recommend it for people without pinky toes.", "I bought these as a father's day gift for my husband. he usually wears an 11 so I ordered 11. The boots fit him perfectly. He started wearing them immediately for short walks in the woods and fields around our home, and he loved them immediately because they needed no breaking in, were light and comfortable like a running shoe, yet give exceptional support with the Vasque soles. I noticed he uses them all the time now, and now he went and bought me a pair of women's breeze high , just like his. I tried them on and sure enough, a perfect fit, light and comfortable, yet very supportive.", "These are wonderful boots, well made, light, and very comfortable. No break in time, felt great first wear. Have about 100 miles on them now and my only concern is that the heels are not going to last as long as the boots. Vibram should have put a little more rubber on the outside half of the heel. Still most comfortable hikers I have owned.", "its been a LONG time since i had a pair of boots that fit and are comfortable right out of the box i actually forgot i had new boots on within the first hour of wearing them. great quality materials and build. i am going to buy another pair in a month,ill wait just to make sure they stay this good. size 11 W", "I have been eyeing this boot for a while due to it's comfort after trying it on a t a local sports store. I plan on hiking a lot in the Arizona area and am looking forward to hitting the trails. For now, I am working 6 days a week 12hr days so my once comfortable shoes are no longer comfortable after about 10 hrs. I have worn these boots and they really are support and comfort for the whole day. I am glad I purchased this pair of boots, they are probably the most comfortable boots I have ever bought.", "The Vasque Breeze 2.0 boots are wonderful. Both my husband and I wear them. this is probably our fifth pair each. We live on 100 acres and spend a lot of time on our feet moving. They stand up to all the riggers of ranch life from mucking stalls, moving \"dirt\" or getting around. The arch support is good, they breath well, and the ankle support is much appreciated. We'll keep wearing them as long as \"Vasque makes and sells them.", "These boots are very comfortable and reasonably durable. They are replacing a pair that I have owned for 2 years that I wore the sole out on. I wore those boots almost daily for those 2 years. They kept my feet dry. They were reasonably warm in the winter in northern New York. I would highly recommend these boots to everyone.", "I've owed four pairs of these boots and I can't wear this newest pair even around the yard without my feet hurting terribly. Seems like the quality and comfort is no longer there. Will be looking into getting one of the old pairs resoled, if it's possible.", "These are my first set of real hiking boots and I'm crazy about them. They fit great, are comfortable and give great support. Wore them on several hikes and they are super comfortable and great at absorbing a ton of pounding. They also provide firm but very comfortable ankle support. I have crazy high arches so I needed arch inserts like I do in most of my footwear because the inserts that come with the shoes are completely flat.", "great quality hiking boots. purchased for my hubby....used these so far for hiking in Colorado and Virginia mountains...he loves them....I have the women's ones and feel the same. He normally wears an 11 but found size 12 fit best in these. Great traction on slippery rocks...hope to use for many years", "They are a great pair of hiking shoes. But I found out that the soles wear out just as fast as a cheaper pair. So why pay the extra money?", "Great boot. Replaced my old Vasque hiking boots. Fit well right from the start. Very little breaking in needed.", "Boot needed minimal break in period. Fits perfect wit medium weight hiking sock. Sole is super grippy, and walking on rocks and other debris was hardly noticeable. Look good, feels good. My Columbias don't compare to these at all.", "I haven't hit the trail with these yet, so they haven't truly been tested, but I have never worn a more comfortable pair of boots straight out of the box. I did have them out in very rainy/muddy weather, and the gortex was doing its job. I'll update this review once I have a chance to really try them out on a hike.", "Great hiking boots, with reliable fit. This reviewer had worn them in dry comfort on a variety of surfaces in all sorts of weathers in Alaska, Canada, and the UK. Highly recommended", "I have put on some miles since I received these and am pleased at this sturdy but not heavy boot. It did not need much breaking in. The only thing that I wish this had are closed lace holders all the way up. The top three are open on the outside. I didn't notice this in the picture. I like a quick lace pull up, but with an open side the lace often comes out. Probably some prefer it that way.", "Wide 10D fit my foot perfectly. I hike 4-6 times a week on rocky steep slippery trails and these boots keep me stable and upright. The 6\" over ankle hight supports and stabilizes my ankles, one of which was badly broken several years ago.", "A tad bit narrow at the small toe, but otherwise ok. sturdy and they seem to breath ok. overall a good shoe. One note, the soles are way more slippery on wet surfaces than the last pair of Vasque light duty hikers I wore. The old pair had great grip. These new ones, not so much. Good for dry surfaces.", "I was told these boots were fantastic... and I was not disappointed! They did not require any break in and fit my wide feet perfectly. I have not had a chance to test how waterproof they are to any significant level. I did buy some shock cord and keepers to replace the laces and that helps with donning and doffing them in a hurry. These are the most comfortable boots I have worn in a long time.", "I was worried because a lot of reviews said the fit was off. The 10.5's I got fit just as they should. I'm 10.5, and occasionally 11 in some brands, and was replacing a pair of 10.5 vasques. They're exactly what I wanted. However they do have somewhat stiff soles, and definitely feel like boots. So if you're looking for \"sneaker-boots\" these may not be quite what you want.", "Maybe the best boots I have bought in the last six years. Plenty of room for my toes so that helps prevent damaged toe nails. Comfortable right out of the box. Sole is heavy enough to protect against the roughest trails. Review is based on the identical pair that I have had for 8 months and have used for a lot of hiking.", "To date I have backpacked approximately 150 miles in these boots. The longest hike being a 52 mile, 4 1/2 day trek across Zion National Park. Other than a small blisters on a small toe, I have had no problem hiking in these boots.The boots required no break-in period; they were comfortable right out of the box. I ram using Superfeet insoles with the boots. I wear a US 8 1/2 shoe size. My Breeze boots are US 9 1/2 and are a good fit. I have not tested the boots in wet conditions and haven't owned them long enough to rate durability, so I am rating them 4 stars instead of 5 stars.", "I needed a boot that I could break in and take on a 3 week trek to Everest Base Camp. I took these boots on one 10-mile hike and didn't get a single blister so I was super happy at first. But then when I got home I inspected the boots and found tiny chunks of the sole had started to rip off around the toe area. The hike I did wasn't that rough either. I can't trust these to last for 3 weeks if they started showing wear after a 1 day hike. Returned.", "Quite happy with these. A little heavy, but so far after one summit in Indonesia, I am pretty happy with them. I bought the wide version, one size up from my usual size and they fit well. I feel a slight roll towards the back of heal since the soul is slightly curved at the back though I think I'll get used to it. Comfortable on the first hike out of the box.", "Just a little bit tight on the outsides of my toes, maybe should have gotten a wide version but they have worn into great boots now. Extremely sturdy and I took them on a rigorous backcountry hike a week after receiving them and only wearing them twice. I came back with no feet issues at all.", "I don't know if I had a defect in my boot, but the left boot fit me perfectly while the right boot kept rubbing my little toe in a way that forced me to tape the piggy up so that I wouldn't blister. I've never had any problems with blisters before, and my right foot is the same size as my left - so it was frustrating knowing that my left foot was so comfortable while my right foot was suffering a bit. These boots did their job after I taped up my one little toe, and they got me up and down Kilimanjaro without any other issues.", "Fits as expected, I bought the size 10, standard fit. They're wide enough, and will loosen up a bit with time. This is my second pair of vasque boots, and they made a few changes to them. I like that the front of the toe is reinforced, last ones were soft. Just and comfortable, but I haven't worn them on a very windy day. Don'I'm not sure how much the wind cuts through yet.", "This is not necessarily a review on the boots but more of a disclaimer about buying shoes/clothes online... You really don't know what you're getting. The pictures show a pair of boots I bought for a deployer that are 1) two different sizes (8W and 10W) and 2) two different colors. It also doesn't help that the re-shipment is running late.", "These are great boots I walk on concrete all day this is my second pair would definitely buy again I would recommend anybody who's on their feet long hours in a warehouse situation or Construction", "True high top that covers the ankle these boots are very supportive. I have an extremely lumpy rugged lawn and these boots provide great support while I am mowing as I use a self-propelled mower. For wide hiking boots, the choice is limited and it's great to be able to get a boot of this quality. Well made and designed.", "After reading the reviews and trying on a pair at a local store, I went with a 0.5 size bigger than the Vasque boots I was replacing. One fit just perfectly out of the box and the other was just a little loose; not unexpected with two feet slightly different in size. I worked on adjusting the laces on the loose one a while to get it feeling good. A full day walking around the house was very comfortable. They look nice and quality appears good. Haven't had a chance to really break them in or take them for some miles yet.", "They fit perfectly and are better built than any boot I've had in years. I'm a contractor and I'm extremely hard on boots and toes...these are very comfortable and the Gore-Tex interior and rubber toe are tough as nails! Great boot...well made", "Used mainly for long day hikes, which could be on rough trails or walking in cities, this is the third pair I have owned. I am still wearing the other two at times for gardening, light construction work, and short hikes. They are comfortable, and allow just enough foot movement to be comfortable without allowing too much to cause calluses. I have a narrow heel and wide forefoot, so have had difficulty finding good fitting boots. I'll probably be buying a fourth pair sometime.", "I bought my first pair of Vasque 4 years ago and I was hooked. No break in needed. They were very comfortable from the first time I tried them on. . I have a wide foot and and they fit me great. I have always wore size 9W but in this boot I wear a size 10W.", "These boots fit great, look great, and I did not have to break them in like most other boots. They were comfortable wearing all day from the first day I got them. So far these seem to be a durable boot. However, after a few months, one of the eyelets came out of the boot when I was tying them. I popped it back in and just have to be careful when tying them now.", "I'm quite familiar with this brand and style and I like the comfort. I hear what other reviewers say about a decline in quality and will re-review if I run into any problems. So far I've done one hike, 8 mile in steep rocky terrain. They definitely have better grip than the old pair I replaced.", "I haven't had the chance to test these out yet, but they feel really comfortable right out of the box. This is my first pair of hiking boots so I researched a bunch of shoes before I settled on these. I got the size in 10.5 wide, half a size up from my shoe size and they seem to fit nicely. The wide is very roomy on the sides. I'm used to heavier work boots so I was quite surprised at how light they were. They feel closer to tennis shoes than what I think of boots. Quite comfortable and good ankle support. I will test them out and post an update on how they handle in action.", "Read all the reviews and saw these run narrow & small. I ordered a full size bigger & wide (I never wear wide). Length was good, but my pinky toes were smashed up against the side of these boots. Returned these and bought the Salomon 4d gtx2, more money, but much better fit for my feet. 2 stars because they were light, and looked well constructed.", "bought one pair.. the left shoe leaked. asked for a replacement pair... the one the second pair the right boot leaked. I returned both faulty shoes and kept the good ones. Seems their quality control is hit or miss. But now that I have a good piar, they work great.. I can go in deep water all the way to the top of the boot and not get wet as long as water doesn't enter from the top opening (obviously).", "So far so good. Fit is good. Toe box not too narrow. Was thinking of getting new 3.0 but for $100 these should do nicely. I've got Vasque Sundowners that have lasted many years and I'm hoping these do as well. Will update review after trip to Yellowstone in May/June.", "I've been wearing these boots for about 5 years now and go through a pair a year wearing them everyday for construction type work. They are very durable. Some pairs are more water resistant than others but in general as good as can be expected. Somewhat hot for summertime but tolerable. I have tried several other brands that offer widths in a similar shoe and none have the fit the Vasque does. My previous pair had an almost imperceptible bulge in the right hand foot bed that over time became a problem so when you buy these you should inspect them carefully and return them immediately if anything doesn't feel right.", "I bought these on the recommendation of a friend when I was looking for quality hiking boots. The boots were pretty comfy out of the box. Minimal breaking in needed IMO. I gave them a good test run with a several hours long mountain hike. The boots took a beating and were no worse for wear. I'll update after I've had them for a while.", "I have the older version of these boots that I am still wearing. After about 600 miles they started to leak. Like most Gortex boots, the constant flexing in the toes causes the material to weaken and let in the water. These boots have lasted far longer than any others before leaking. My original boots are pretty beat up now, but still give me the support I need when doing my day hikes. I love these boots and bought the newest pair for $130. The price has jumped to $170. I might try another brand if the price remains that high.", "Differences were the tongue was a bit shorter and had very little padding. The upper lacing was the old school metal instead of the poly type on the original, and doesn't grip the lace as well, tending to pop out. Interior gortex in the toe area is bunched/ folded and irritates my toes. They seem to feel a bit tighter in the width, but may stretch with wear. Still like the weight and boot, hoping it gets better with time. 2 June 2016 Update Two years later and I finally need a new pair! Old ones will be for yard work. They got better with time and was pleased. I wear these every day usually on the motorcycle.", "I like these boots but something separated and pushed into the toe box from the side and is crushing my outside toes in both boots. That makes the pair useless to me. I am disappointed that the boots did not last 2 years. My first pair lasted almost 10 years before the rubber sole came off.", "Best hiking shoe for the money. I wear mine in about the most rugged country you'll ever hike and they hold up very well. Trinity Alps. Wilderness, Marble Mt. Wilderness, Russian Wilderness!", "This is probably the 5th pair of these exact shoes that I've purchased over 10+ years. Yes, that means I like the shoes a lot and every pair has been an excellent fit. I typically wear them until they physically fall apart and then they become gardening shoes.", "Wow! These hiking boots are the best I have owned! They provide the proper support and they feel great as I am hiking. These are my go too boots when I am traveling and exploring nature!", "at first I wasn't sure I liked these and they were a bit narrow, but once they broke it they fit great.. they come on and off really easily and provide good ankle support. they were a bit stiff at first but seem to be adapting to their purpose well.. great quality and make and arrived really fast..", "This is my third pair of these, I knew they were going to be good and I was not disappointed. Only been wearing them for a week but I knew from past experience they would deserve 5 stars.", "I have worn Vasque hiking boots nearly every day for several years. It is the only shoe I feel that I can order with the confidence that it will fit as well as previous pairs that I've bought. They hold together very well and do not need any breaking in.", "It may sound cheesy but I always wanted a Vasque. First time I saw it on a mall, they didn't have my size, so I deliberately gave up on that..Until I saw it here in amazon, and boy, they surprised me! Saying this model \"fitted just as expected\" would be dishonest. I unboxed it and went in into my feet just like a sneaker! 5 thumbs for Vasque model 2.0..the good thing about this model is that Vasque but some \"string\" outside the boot, making it easy to wear them.", "I am quite happy with this shoes, there are amazing and fit as expected but one of the shoes is not as effective against water as the other one, so thats weird and well that was the main reason I bought them, not happy at all about that, I am even considering contacting costumer services because of this.", "The boots fit nice and snug and comfortable.Mine aren't totally waterproof,they let some moisture in from repeated dousing from a water hose to clean them from mud.seem well constructed and I wear them daily and will do so till the snow flies.", "This is my backpacking boots for winter hiking. This is my 3rd pair of Vasque Breeze but the first with the new 2.0 version. They are a little lighter weight than the previous version. These are the only boots that I've ever put on and backpacked without having to \"break\" them in first. 14 miles the first day without a hint of a problem.", "This is my second pair, so commenting mostly on my first. PROS: Go-to for light hikes, dog walking, errands. Excellent ankle and arch support. Wide sizing is great for my wide toe box. Tread is tacky and works well on slippery surfaces. CONS: Footbed is a little too cushy for my tastes. Heel strikers will wear out the tread there rather quickly. I wouldn't boulder or hike on rocky paths with these -- you will feel it through the footbed. I use a stiffer-soled boot such as Asolos for that kind of terrain.", "Took these boots for a test drive on a 30% grade muddy hill. These boots gripped the ground like a Sherman Tank. Took my hose and squirted my boots and my feet stayed perfectly dry. Love the lace system as well with 3 grommits on each side to reallly tighten and remove boots with ease. Highly recommend these boots and Vasque is a pioneer in mountaineering with high quality workmanship.", "I have a very narrow 11.5 B and this boot just fits a bit on the loose side. A good pair of wool socks makes them super comfortable right from the start with no break in needed. I have done several short hikes with these on steep gravel and rock and am very pleased. Also in pouring rain and hosed off after and no water leaks. Highly recommended. Excellent service too!", "What a great pair of boots! I use a custom orthotics and as a result, I ordered one 1/2 size bigger & 1 size wider. Fits perfectly. Went on a trial hike twice so far with this boots and feels very comfortable & supportive. As far as waterproof-ness, I was told by another hiker that, even with gore-tex, this shoes is NOT 100% waterproof especially if you are hiking in the snow all day. So far, I'm very impressed with these boots!", "I wear these boots all day long for work. I'm always moving through people's homes, up and down stairs, steep driveways, etc. I have no complaints at all. As for the fit, I've always measured 11.5 E on a Brannick device. The people that say it fits snug, probably don't know their proper size. I've also been working in the snow constantly. Coupled with a good pair of socks, my feet stay nice and warm. I would recommend these to anyone who wants a good light hiker for work, or for their intended use. I look forward to hitting the trails in these, once the snow melts here in New Hampshire. (Probably not till August.)", "Have taken several hikes of a few miles, and they breathe extremely well. I don't normally love hiking boots, but that may be because these are the first pair that fit and fully support my foot and ankle. These would have not been regulation, but I would have loved to have had these when I was in the infantry. I would definitely buy these again.", "I bought these boots half a size bigger than I usually get and in a wide fit, based on reviews of others. They fit just perfectly with regular smartwool hiking socks. I have just returned from my first outing in them, about 6 miles on light mixed terrain, 20% road and 80% dirt trail. No discomfort at all and more importantly no toe crunch on a short steep downhill stretch.", "Good fit for width, but a little short. WAY too tight at the ankle, very painful unless the upper is kept so lose that the shoe often comes untied. With a fair amount of dickering and longer laces I am able to make the shoe adequate for fit and comfort. It's a shame because the Vasque Breeze is a well-made shoe that's light with a great sole and arch support. I'll keep them for short hikes locally, but won't take them out in woods with me.", "Fit well, needed no break in. I have a narrow foot and the boots fit well. They were very comfortable for general chores, spending the day in a fishing boat, and some water exposure . They are waterproof though I've only used them for one week. But - I was walking in a lake - about halfway up the boot - and my feet were still dry. I'd recommend them but haven't done any extensive hiking in them.", "These have become my favorite hiking boots. They fit well, provide good arch support and protect my ankles as well. For a full boot, they are fairly light. About the only downside is that they don't last as long as other good brands, such as Asolo. But, still, these lasted for about 18 months of fairly regular hiking.", "Took these on a 3 week long hiking trip in the upper Appalachians in Maine. The performed perfectly, they were comfortable (but I have normal sized feet). They were extremely stable and held up well after hours each day of hiking. I can honestly say after over 100 miles in the mountains with these they held up perfectly and still to this day show only minimal wear.", "Like the support, price. Works great for my narrow heel, regular width front, the heel does not lift off. Purchased pretty much identical Breeze 2 and Breeze 3 models at the same time, seem to prefer wearing the less expensive 2 :-)", "Very supportive, comfortable and waterproof. Mixed use of working on concrete and hiking. This boot is hard to beat for my purposes! This is my fourth or fifth pair over a period of years. Wish the heel and soles lasted longer....usually the shoes still look nice when I retire because of bottom wear.", "I am right between a 10.5 and an 11. I had a similar low top Vasque that fit fine in 10.5D, but the toe box on these were too cramped, and I didn't think it would resolve itself by breaking in, so I had to send them back. Nice boots, just a fit issue.", "I bought these for hiking, but now I where them all the time. I even where them to work when there is inclement weather, dress shoes are normally required. It does take about a day for the sole to conform to the bottom of your foot, but I've worn these walking, hiking and just standing around for 12+ hours straight with no complaints.", "Nice boots just to small (narrow) in the toe box. I ordered a wide 13EE they fit great until the toe tapered down to much crunching my toes up. I normally wear Keen's and they fit fine. I wanted to try something new and it just didn't work out for me.", "Not waterproof after 2 months. I wear these daily and they are extremely comfortable but if you need dry feet look somewhere else for boots.", "These Vasque are I feel in a class not found in other shoes they are the finest, I know I have used Vasque for I can't remember 50 years? These are lightweight, rugged, as I use them in Lava country in the Mt. Shasta area in my work on old emigrant wagon roads..", "Love the boots. They are a little large, because I ordered the same size Vasque boot I had had last time, so I ordered the same size in this new style, they are just a little too big , but didn't have time to exchange them for a smaller size. Otherwise very comfortable boot. Take some time to break in.", "Believe all the reviews about the size being smaller than expected. I wear 12 Med but the boots were too small. Sent them back and had to pay shipping costs myself. Ordered 13 2e and they fit great. Have been wearing them at camp for a week. Good support and comfort. Best hiking boots of the four pair that I have by far.", "The most comfortable footwear I've ever had, ever. Outstanding quality!", "Purchased these for my son for an upcoming week of hiking in Yosemite. He started wearing them early to \"break in\" but really seems unnecessary as he says they are super comfortable and no sore feet after a long day at school (and he often complains of his feet hurting). Highly recommend!", "So uncomfortable. The toe box is too narrow, and I purposely got a size larger. Had to have a cobbler stretch them. Bought these to replace an old pair of Vasques (30 years) which were much better made. Very lightweight in weight and, unfortunately, construction. Wanted breathability - couldn't tell the difference. A total waste of money.", "These are amazing boots. They're tough, versatile, and are well crafted. I honestly don't think I'll get rid of these boots unless I absolutely have to.", "I love Vasque boots. I've had a couple pairs of the Clarion models in the past and worn them for years each. This time I decided to try the Breeze model. We were heading to Colorado for vacation and received these only a couple days before we left on the trip, wore them on several long hikes with no break-in time and they were perfectly fitted and comfortable.", "I had to return the first pair for a slightly wider pair. The other reviews indicated these boots run narrow in sizing, so plan accordingly. That said, the second (wider) pair fit absolutely perfectly. I love wearing them. The tread is fairly stiff, and the boots are warm and waterproof. I wore these during a hike up Kilimanjaro this July, and my feet never blistered, nor did I suffer any discomfort. I look forward to future hikes and would gladly buy this brand again.", "Nice looking hiking boot, but very narrow toe box. I suggest that you get a size larger than normal. Oh -- I wore only one pair of socks, no liner.", "Great all purpose boots. Weatherproof but breathable, which is a great combination. Wore these in Oklahoma during cold and rain and had no problems. A little wide for me, but with thick socks they fit great. Hopefully they will hold up over time.", "I'm very pleased with these boots! I walk extensively (around 3000 mi/year) so a good fit that's waterproof and light in weight besides is a gem! I have somewhat narrower feet so I often have to compromise but not here! The instep is high (as advertised) but took no time to adjust to it. Break-in period was maybe a total of 3 miles one morning. Sweet!", "Have to say this are great Comfortable boots I had them for two weeks now, I work in film industry and average 15 miles a day of pushing pulling and carrying gear in all kinds of terrain and weather , and so far they have handle great .", "Comfortable but not waterproof at all - I thought it was just me but every time I wear these boots my feet get wet even in the smallest amounts of snow - kind of disappointed for \"Gore-Tex\" Boots to not be waterproof", "Just got done hiking 30 miles. These shoes performed admirably. While my feet ached, I never had blisters or sore spots, just the normal walking 30 miles ache. Great shoes. Will always buy/recommend", "Usually wear a size 8, bought a size 8.5 and it was still to small", "My husband LOVES these boots. He has a narrow foot and these fit him perfect. He uses these for hiking and snowshoeing mostly. His have seen Montana, California, Florida and many states in between. Husband can wear them all day and be comfortable. Best of all the GTX keeps his feet dry!", "I have owned these shoes for a little over a year, and they are holding up well. They are comfortable for wearing while walking or working outdoors. My only complaint is that they are squeaky if they are wet and walking indoors on a commercial floor. (grocery store, etc)", "I bought these for my dad for father's day and he absolutely loves them. They fit true to size and he says they \"feel really good\" on his feet. They are light and breathable, yet firm and protective. The fact that they're water proof just makes it even better. They look sleek and rugged at the same time, not too clunky like lots of other hiking boots.", "I've always had great luck with Vasque hikers. These are my 5th pair. I've never had any that needed to be broke in before hitting the trail. Straight out of the box they're comfy and ready for the trail.", "I had to return the first pair for one-half size larger than my regular size. I'm replacing a 15 year old pair if Vasque boots which I loved. These new ones are just \"less\" but will serve my purpose. They look good and feel good but I have yet to test them on an extended hike. The initial quality is good but only time will tell.", "These boots were purchased based on existing shoe/boot sizes and fit was perfect. They wear very comfortable and I would compare hiking/walking in them to the comfort of wearing cross trainers. My wife and I hiked in snowy weather in Wyoming and my feet never got wet or felt cold with wool hiking socks on. The sole protected my feet from rocks and the added reinforcement around the toe and heel should add longevity to the boot. I highly recommend these.", "I find it fits me fine, I ware a size 12. 2 or 3 E depending on the shoe. It is very comfortable and seems to be well constructed. I haven't had time to ware for long periods as yet, been busy with other things. will try to update later when I can spend more time to using.", "As mentioned by some other reviewers these tend to run a bit small. I usually wear a 9.5 (US) M, but ordered a 10. Fits quite well, almost snug with medium weight socks. Ordering a full size larger might be better if you plan on adding insoles or orthotics. Overall quite pleased and hoping wear and performance will match others experience. My previous Vasque boots lasted over 10 years (support finally broke down) - out with the old, in with the new!", "The rubber protection around the toe has to be sealed better where it is it here to the leather toe top! The top steel shoelace are shoelace eyelets need to be case-hardened they bend out of place when the strings are pulled tight!", "Completely waterproof after a years use. I hiked all through the rockies, tracked through snow, dragged a deer 3 miles, and these bad boys are still in great shape. Not a drop of water has gotten through. They run about a 1/2 size big, so keep that in mind. Overall they have a sturdy sole, great ankle support, great wet weather traction, and look great. I couldn't recommend them more!", "So far, so good. Very comfortable boots. I ordered a half size larger than usual (11), allotting for doubling-down on wool socks on cold treks, and these suckers fit as though I ordered a ten and a half pair of boots. I've heard there are break-in periods for these kinds of boots, but they really feel comfortable. Warm, weatherproof, and comfy = Good pair of boots! (probably should go an extra size larger though just in case)", "Love these boots! Due to the somewhat unfavorable review of the latest boots, I decided to spring for the year old model. So far, very comfrotable, stable, and provide me with excellent support. Thanks Vasque!", "This is the third pair of boots of this model that I have purchased. I am a park ranger by profession and have used these boots as an all around boot every day in my job the last several years. They are lightweight and I love that they are waterproof. A big part of my decision to buy my first pair was that they come in size 15 that I need. I recommend them.", "Bought as a gift for a friend and she really likes them!", "I have a wide foot (2E width). I have been having trouble finding a hiker with a width width that fits correctly. These do and are very comfortable. I did take Amazon's fit guide recommendation to get a size 11 instead of size 10.5. My normal shoe size is a 10.5 2E. The 11 fits perfect in the 2E width so I would estimate the shoe runs 1/2 size smaller compared to Reebok, Nike gym shoes.", "Didn't spend much time breaking them in before hiking down the grand canyon. These boots were comfortable the entire trip down and up (15 miles round trip). I have recommended them to my friends.", "Vasque has been my favorite boot for years. I like the comfort and quality of their shoes. I'm a hiker and have always worn high boots for ankle support. I just put 10.5 miles on the Long Trail in these and had no blisters, no pain and my feet felt good when the day was done.", "So far the breaking in of the Vasque Men's Breeze boots have been as expected. I do not plan to wear winter socks with them as I am indoors and outdoors throughout the day. If I were to wear winter socks I would go with 1 size larger as they are a tight fit that I prefer for support. Comfort is about the best you can get. There is no hiking boot on the market like the old style full leather and full eyelet boots of yesteryear. Vasque in my opinion has the best hiking boot on the market today. Hope the glue holds up as this has been a problem no matter the make.", "Outstanding! My first pair of Vasques finally wore out after 6 years of hiking everywhere from the Grand Canyon to Mammoth Cave to Yellowstone to the Smoky Mountains plus 100s of miles as a Scoutmaster. I'm sure I'll be just as happy with these!", "Toe box area is tight compared to other hiking boots the same size but the biggest disappointment is that waterproof capabilities of the boots failed after 3 1/2 months, would strongly suggest looking elsewhere.", "Very comfortable and great support. Had to order half-size larger to give room for descending hills. Highly recommend.", "hiked the Grand Canyon and had no issues at all. Hiked 15 miles in one day with no discomfort at all. My feet stayed dry from perspiration and small stream crossings. Footing was great the soles had unbelievable grip.", "Haven't had these for very long. Not going to promise anything, but I'll try to update after several months. Up to this point though, they have been great. Very comfortable, good weight and fit.", "I wear a true 9.5 wide and pronate. After 6 months and about 50 miles these shoes are unusable. Cut narrow. I ordered a 10w and I have already worn out the soles on the outside. So, if you have wide feet and pronate, this may not be your shoe.", "Seem to be well made and look great. HOWEVER, I got the 10.5 2E that are too narrow across the ball of my foot. Candidly, I have D width boots that are as wide. China boot makers need a wider last. This is the second pair of boots made in China that are NOT a true 2E width. Sorry to say the boots are going back.", "Well af.ter using the boots for 3 days I stop using them because my feet hurt and was not able to walk. So I now have a pair of boots that I paid over one hundred dollars I will not able to use", "Great hiking boot. comfortable. I have a wide toe and narrow heal. However if you need a really waterproof boot where you will be walking in a lot of water you (eg. hiking Patagonia) should consider another choice.", "Needs a good break in period. I am a avid hiker, this is my second pair. My first pair lasted over 1 1/2 years of heavy use including climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Africa. I don't agree with the waterproof statement after hiking 5 hours in a heavy mist they were soaked through and through also they are lacking a little in arch support but overall a great boot", "I have ordered Vasque footwear several times. The thing to remember is to order 1/2 size larger. They are a great hiking or just wearing boot. Every pair I have gotten last several years, before needing to replace them.", "The first hiking boots I have ever owned that were ready to hike in day one! I did 5 miles with them out of the box with no discomfort. I have narrow feet and wear a man's size 13 B. Usually I spend weeks or months breaking in a pair of boots.", "Great shoe; well made, good sole except very slippery on wet smooth surfaces, extremely light. My only complaint is that a 9.5 US size fits like a 9.0 US. Be sure to order a half size larger when ordering these Vasque boots. I will be reordering another pair and giving these to someone.", "Had the previous version for several years and it was a great boot. Newer version has a slightly tighter fit and overall quality seems to have gone down.", "These are super boots. They are very comfortable, string and lightweight. They fit perfect. As soon as they arrived I put them on and took my GS for a long walk. I recommend them highly", "You can't beat these boots for extreme comfort, great quality, and an excellent price. I love them! They do fit a little small, so go up a half size or so. I normally use 11.5 E, and I got 12 E, and they fit just great.", "Fantasmic boot, son. Of course, wear your favourite hiking socks to accompany these salty dogs and you will enjoy whatever you are treading upon.", "I bought these to use as a quick trip to frozen Chicago (from Phoenix). I wanted something that could translate to a regular hiking boot and these were exactly what I was looking for. I was able to wear them in the cold weather, comfortably with no issue. I wore them with heavy wool socks.", "A bit narrower and shorter. Still seem comfy out of the box. Only worn one day so hard to comment to much so far.", "I have yet to do any serious hiking with these boots or test the waterproofing thoroughly but they are comfortable and appear to be very well made. It's important to note that they do run a little small. I usually wear a 10.5 and 11 fit perfectly.", "I am a woman, wear a men's boot. Had to reorder for the EE and it fit great. I like to double bow the final tie and with the new fatter laces these were a little short. Wish they were longer. Have worn Vasque, this boot basically, since the 90's and will continue. Love the boot.", "I am disappointed with these pair of boots. I tried wearing them more than once and every time I wore them my little toe started hurting. I ended having more than one bunion from these shoes. Unfortunate for me I should of returned them but thought that the problem would go away. I really feel that it was just a defective pair of boots. I feel the inside of the boot must of not been sewn right. I definately will check things out thorough in the future..", "Because my feet are narrow, especially my heel, I have a hard time finding hiking boots. In fact, up until I bought these, I had been backpacking in trail runners. Unfortunately, trail runners aren't so good when conditions are really wet or during the winter, so I thought I would give buying a hiking boot one last shot. I was not disappointed. These are the most comfortable boots I've ever had right out of the box.", "I do wish they had more cushion. I added Dr. Scholls inserts for more cushion and they are so comfortable now. They are warm yet not too warm they are breathable. They seem sturdy and are waterproof with great tread. Great hiking boot although stiff but they are breaking in. They are not sneakers they are boots and are light too.", "Talk about light weight! They feel as light and comfortable as running shoes. The rubber welts add a measure of protection for the toe of the boot in rough, rocky terrain. Four stars rather than five? Round laces. Walking in >ankle-high grass will make the bunny ears come undone. Double tie them firmly and you're good to go.", "Vasque boots are awesome. I'm a truck driver and we're very tough in shoes. I normally buy a new pair of shoes every six months.. my last pair of Basque boots are over a year old and BARELY show any wear! I love em!", "I generally try to wear trail runners, but sometimes I'm forced to wear boots (SAR), and these are my go-to's. They're offered up as \"light hikers\", but I'd use them for pretty much anything.", "The styling and build are very impressive. Minimal packaging and care to use recycled a big plus. They truly do feel perfect, right out of the box.", "Boots are extremely comfortable and fit very well. Only issue is durability of the sole. After one year of wearing, the soles have already started to break free.", "Wide still a little too narrow in the forefoot. Also where tongue folds on medial part of ankle causes discomfort on right ankle though not left. Most likely just how boot fits me rather than a real issue with boot though will unfortunately sending back. Too bad, liked the design, color and price!", "Great boots, very comfortable. I do a lot of open terrain hiking in the desert and mountains and have no comfort or durability problems", "First pair of Vasque hiking boots and wish I had tried them before. Very comfortable and feel great. Can't wait to put them to use so I can see how they hold up!!", "This is my second pair. I really loved my first pair. The fit is really good as I bought the wide one. There is only one slight problem. After wearing for a year, the waterproof quality has somewhat diminished. My feet do get a bit wet when walking through water. I suppose I can spray with a waterproofing gel.", "Not to toot my own horn, I go very high altitude often. Owned several boots from every shade of brand. This is the only brand that stands the test of time. No blisters, no lower back and or hip problems exist when I\u2019m in these. Water proof is legit. Year owner-", "I bought these after reading the other reviews about how comfortable they were. Everyone was right, Vasque makes some nice boots IMO.", "This is my second pair. I wore out the first pair after many hours hiking up mountains on rocky trails. I went a half size larger to accommodate heavy socks but I would say that the size runs pretty true. Love the support, and the open construction lets my feet stay cooler.", "I wore these on a two day hiking and camping trip and they felt great the whole time. No problems at all. I did not use them for our river crossings, but I plan on it next trip. I want to see how they do wet and how long it takes to dry them out.", "Kudos to Amazon. I bought the d width to start. Just too tight. I set up an exchange for the w width, and 2 days later they were here.Amazon set me up with a prepaid UPS return label for the narrow ones. Ive worn these hiking 3 times and they're great. So comfortable, that when I get back home after a hike I can leave them on.", "The boots are NOT waterproof. I wore these boots everyday for 7 weeks. At about the 4th week the glue from the toe area began to come off. I think these boots are made for day hiking and easy terrain. I was going through some rough terrain and these boots did not handle it well. I did not give them 2 stars because I believe these boots are great if you are not hardcore hiking everyday. If you are backpacking or doing something extreme do not get these. They simply cannot handle it. My friend bought a pair of merrels and they did better than these.", "Boots these boots specifically for the wide fit. In comparing with other models that are not labelled \"wide,\" there is little difference. If you take out the footbed, it it the same size as a regular fit. Trying to find a wide shoe while the manufactures limit the availability continues to be frustrating. Overall, construction and design seems to be well done. To bad they shortcut the width.", "Used and abused daily as work boots. Time to replace them after 2 years, the best compliment i can give these shoes is that the sole wore out before the waterproof materials", "Nice light/mid-weight hiker. Very comfortable out of the box. Somewhat narrow, particularly in toe box. A bit warm, but typical of gore-tex. Attractive, with aggressive lugged sole. Overall, a nice all-purpose hiker.", "I have loved these boots. I wore them every day all day for a week straight camping. They felt perfect from day one. Didn't take any time to \"break in.\" Excellent support and protection.", "I sent a pair of Oboz back and ordered these. They were comfortable right out of the box! Really. I've hiked twice so far with them on and they're AWESOME! My feet stay warm, not roasting, and dry. The ankle support is perfect. I would say hard to beat. Best price? Amazon by $35 dollars. That's a lot of mula!", "Boot that I currently wear and it has been discontinued. So happy I found some instock", "This is my 6th or 7th pair of these boots. I work on a railroad and do lots of walking on large rocks and uneven surfaces. These are the most comfortable boots I've ever worked in. I do use custom fitted orthotics.", "I got these boots based on a YourTube recommendation and I have worn them every day sense. These boots fit great, but for sure you need the right socks to go with them. I got some Darn Tough socks based on another video and the two go great together.", "My husband loves these. He bought them a half size big to make sure there would be no toe crunching up against the boot on downhill ascents and he has been very pleased with them. So far, they have been very comfortable on a two day hike for 3-5 hours each day.", "These boots worked very well for a cold weekend hiking trip, my feet were warm all weekend and completely dry", "I haven't gone on any long treks yet, but so far these boots feel super supportive and comfortable. I tried on lots of different brands at REI and Vasque just seemed to fit me best. Really love the color and the build quality too! - Justin", "My second pair they are comfortable and work for all day wear. Don't last as long as previous boots but probably weren't intended for everyday wear.", "My husband has worked in these boots for years but they change the quality and didn't even last a year", "A great hiking boot that is light and tough. My third pair.", "Had to order 1/2 size larger than normal. Regular shoe size ended up being too small. Like the shoes. Very light and descent quality for the price.", "I bought a second pair to rotate as I like wearing them to work. The shoe runs a little narrow, I wear a 13 M and these felt a little too narrow but actually I have grown to like the snugness of fit. They will pinch some people in the little toe. There is now a EE version available which I haven't tried. These are great for light hiking and all around wear but not for heavy backpacking, not enough support, get a heavy duty leather boot. This shoe feels more like a high-top, snug, bedroom slipper which most of the time is good thing!", "The shoe is well made but there is a seam on the inside that goes across your inside ankle bone that is really a pain. I purchased some moleskin and put it over the seam which helped greatly. Knowing what I do now I would not buy these shoes again.", "I like these. I wear a size 8.5 and usually get a size 9. These are my go to shoes when I go on vacation and expect to do a lot of walking and only want to take the pair I'm wearing.", "Hard to tell if these are as a good as previous versions, when the first pair I bought was way narrow for a Vasque in a men's 10D. I imagine they'll prove as good as previous models once I can get a 10-2E somewhere", "Great working boots. water proofing near the mesh a little disconcerting, but these boots are grippy on the hills and durable. Just need to fix that somewhat leaky mesh problem.", "First of all, they came with no visible defects. The Danner's I bought and returned had defects. Secondly, they fit like a glove and are very comfortable right out of the box. I'm sure the sole will relax a bit after wearing them a while. I have seen many great reviews on this hiking boot and hope they are spot on, I will be doing a lot of hiking this year and will find out quickly how durable they really are.", "I like this boot, almost just like my old one , the one I got from REI. I will wear its when I go camping, fishing , hunting and hiking !", "Really pleased with these shoes, very comfortable. Have helped by feet where I work part time standing on a concrete floor. I have a narrow foot and it is very difficult to find good fitting shoes. Would buy these again.", "Great boots. Didn't take too long to break them in, give great support in the ankle. Would recommend.", "Great shoe, awesome for hiking. Make sure you wear good socks or they might pinch your toes if you have wide feet..", "Runs small. Great shoes but order a size up. I had hoped mine would break in- now that they are worn im stuck with an expensive pair of shoes that I don't wear often because they hurt my feet.", "Excellent fit for my oversize, wide, and difficult-to-fit foot. I love how Vasque introduced the soft upper and breathable material, an improvement on the leather clunky boots of years past. They're comfortable against the lower calf/shin whereas most boots pinch or rub on my skin in the same spot. I've only received these a week ago and used them around my home, but look forward to taking them out for a test run!", "After trying numerous top brands of Gore-Tex light hiking boots at REI, and experiencing fit issues with all of them, I tried the Vasque Men's Breeze 2.0. Size 13 fit like they're made for me, and they remain comfortable all day long. When Amazon ran a special price at $94 (instead of the $170 list), I grabbed a second pair in an alternative color. I'm very pleased with the construction and comfort of this Vasque product.", "I have had nothing but good results with Vasque boots in the past. This is probably my sixth pair in 10 years and have never had any problems with any of them.", "Only had these for a couple days now. Great out of the box comfort. Minimal break in before a big hike. Surprisingly breathable. I was hesitant to get the GTX but I wore them all day in 90 degree high humidity heat in South Carolina and had no problem with sweat in the boot. That is very unusual for me.", "Vasque knows how to make good, comfortable, durable hiking boots! These are so comfortable and supportive that I like wearing them as soon as the weather gets cool. (90 degree days - they are a bit much!) I have had several pairs, and can't say enough good about them!", "Vasque seems to be using less material in this boot, which is still an acceptable product. Just not as good as the last pair. The price is lower, but I'd rather have the old price and old quality.", "Vasque boots have been the best I have ever owned. I just ordered a pair of Vasque GTX which will give me 3 pair of Vasque that I'm currently using. GREAT BOOTS for Hunting Hiking and daily wear when it's cold outside.", "My son is training for a big hike this summer. These will take him on part of the JMT. Fit perfectly and are sturdy enough for the most vigorous trails!", "I have A-B width foot... These fit great with a heavy sock.... I had some 12's before and they were too long and too wide.... The sole is not long lasting if I WALK on sidewalks...WISH I KNEW HOW TO GET NEW SOLES PUT ON SHOES whose SOLES WEAR OUT FAST!!....(HINT. HINT!!)", "Wow, finally found the perfect hiking boot. Super comfortable from day one. Tried several other name brands but these are way and above the others.", "I'm a light hiker and so this pair works perfectly for me. It's an affordable, comfortable, and durable pair of hiking boots.", "Excellent day wear boot and all around great hiking boot. This is my 20th pair from old to new model. Bery durable and always waterproof.", "Comfortable fit from the moment I put them on. These boots require little, if any, break-in. High quality and great value! Can't wait to get on the hiking trail with them!", "I really like these boots. Lightweight, comfortable, keeps the water out. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I ordered these, but I have been very pleased!", "After reading the reviews on Amazon, I knew I needed to order a size 13, since I usually need a size 12 or 13 depending on the manufacturer. The boots fit well. They are comfortable right out of the box. My feet don't sweat in them when it is warm and they stayed warm while I was outside for much of the day on a 30ish degree day. I have no complaints.", "They run small, but was tolerable. What wasn't tolerable, is a single lug ripped off the sole after just over one year of light use. I will be contacting Vasque to see if they back their products longer than the Amazon return/refund period.", "Excellent lightweight boot. Very durable and comfortable. I will buy this brand again!", "These are my second pair of the Breeze 2.0 and the fourth pair of Vasque. I think the others were the original Breeze. Didn't like the reviews for Breeze 3 so I stayed with what has worked well for me.", "So far so good after two 12 mile backpacking hikes. No real blisters either. The right shoe seems to not cushion the ball of my foot as much as I'd like but its probably a foot issue and not with the shoe since I have weird feet. So far they are holding up well!", "I bought the wide width boot but it was still very narrow, not at all what I expected with a 'wide\" designation. I sent them back and went up a half size (my normal boot range is 9.5-10). These fit better but even the 10.5 wide was still uncomfortably narrow, and they are a bit too long . I'm afraid they'll have to go back as well. Supposedly Vasque makes a 3e width (extra wide) but I can never seem to find that size available online.. It's a shame, too, because I really like the quality of the boot's construction and waterproof promise.", "I really like these boots, this is my third pair. I bought my first pair around 2007 and keep going back to the same model boot. I predominantly wear the boots as daily footwear but have done some light hiking in them in the mountains of North Georgia and also up in Tennessee. They provide good traction and good support. I highly recommend these boots.", "Most comfortable light boot I've wore, wear them to work and on the trails year round. Only downside is they are well vented so the your toes will get wet if you slosh through a few steams and puddles.", "I bought these boots for a 50 mile section hike along the Maryland portion of the Appalachian Trail. Pros: Very sturdy Great ankle support. A few times while crossing particularly rocky terrain I nearly got a few sprains. Luckily these boots have strong ankle support. Water proof. You can walk through a few inches of water without worry of your socks getting wet. Cons: There seems to already be some wear along the upper portion where the tongue meets the ankle region. It isn't too bad but it just seems weird to happen so quickly.", "First pair lasted 4 months but this pair lasted 4 weeks not waterproof at all and they are bending upwards from wear. Not worth the money at all and now we can't even return them 30 day return only! Never again!", "Well made hiking boot. Strong support and quite comfortable. Look forward to many miles on these.", "Very comfortable. Have worn snowshoeing as well as hiking. Warm and dry.", "I'm tough on shoes. I purchased these for work. And I do work outside in varying conditions. I like the gore tex liner my feet stay dry. They've held up for 2 months without a stitch coming loose. Not the prettiest shoe, but well made.", "Not entirely waterproof, but dry out quickly enough. Hiked in them nonstop for 30 days, and they're still in fantastic shape. Would absolutely purchase this brand again.", "When I first put these on they felt a bit tight width wise, but as soon as I laced them up they felt a perfect fit. After an hour long hike with my dog and wearing them for the rest of the day I forgot that I even had boots on they were as comfortable as a pair of trainers, well worth the price.", "Great hiking boot, light weight, flexible, good water proofing and good breathability, very durable. I hiked 500 mi in these with no problems. Highly recommended.", "These are a really comfortable and sturdy pair of boots. The only thing I would recommend is to get the next size larger as they tend to run a bit small from other reviews that I have read. I am normally a size 12 but got the 13, the fit was just right.", "I work outdoors doing biological surveys, so I wore these boots almost every day for two straight summers. They are incredibly comfortable and resilient to the elements. I put these boots through hell and they are still as good as the day i bought them. I recently picked up another pair. Enough said!", "I'm a huge fan of these shoes. They are the only pair of hiking boots I've had that doesn't give me blisters even after wearing them for days at a time. However, one thing to note is that I normally wear a men's 11 for all other shoes, but need a 10.5 with these boots.", "Great boot so far. Required minimal break-in time. I did wear these boots on a short 3.5 mile hike in the Colorado Golden Gate State Park. Boot performed well as much of the trail was snow and snow-packed. Feet remained warm and dry. Great traction. Very satisfied.", "Very comfortable hiking boots without a break-in period. Summited Mount Whitney in one day wearing these and my feet were fine. Took me 17 hours to complete the hike, and I could of continued for longer.", "I purchased the 11 1/2 Wide, which is the same as I wear in other shoes. Fit seems perfect and feel is very comfortable, doesn't seem to need any break-in. Haven't walked more than a few miles at a time thus far, but don't anticipate any problems.", "Nicely made boot, light and dry, but narrower than my Vasque Breeze 1.0 (15 years old); get a wide width if you wear a wide ever.", "fit is great; price is better than in stores. quality boots for serious hiking. third pair of Vasque's; 1 for my son and 2nd for me. hated to part with the first pair with +300 backpacking miles on them.", "My friend told me these boots are great so I bought a pair and they are super nice! Very light so they dont wear you out hiking. I am very happy with them and will tell all my friends about them!", "Best boots I have ever bought. Comfy and waterproof. I have worn them for over 24 hrs straight with out pain.", "I got no regret since the first day the boot arrived. Very comfortable and to me it's stylish too. I've tried walking in the rain and was amazed with the waterproof. It's totally dry inside. And for a boots I think this is consider light, which is good for me. I am a photographer and i always carry heavy gear with me. Somehow I felt that the boot actually gave a a very good support and well balance. 5 stars for this pair of boots.", "Just a tad bit small. Love he shoes. They seem very sturdy and well constructed", "My son wore these in preparation, and for a Philmont 11 day hiking trek and had zero issues. Lots of people were wearing them and loving them on the trails.", "After reading other reviews I went a 1/2 size larger hoping for a little extra width. Use them mainly for work boots around the yard and garden so don't do a lot of long distance walking with them. They are just a tad narrow. They are replacing a pair of very comfortable work boots, similar in style, that have been discontinued.(men's boot, ordered under my wife's name-don't want to confuse anyone)", "I wear 12M and that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly. Great ankle support but the tongue has seams you will feel. Wear thick socks. Only major con...no traction at all on muddy trails and wet rocks. The sole will just slip and slide off wet rocks.", "I have flat feet and the 2E sizing was great, but DEFINITELY get a size up. I typically wear a 10 2E, but the 10.5 2E is perfect. Rugged, very water resistant, very comfortable and looks great. Love these guys. Very confident they will last for many many years.", "Just got the boots and haven't warn them yet, but tried them on when they arrived. Fit is as expected. Good quality boots for the price.", "Worked well on my 5 day back pack but make sure you get them 1/2 a size bigger. If a boot fits you'll then need room in the toes. Down hill turned my nails blue. really beat up my feet because I didn't go a bit larger than what fit.", "this is the perfect hiking footwear that i need. Not to heavy, and just the right flexibility for my hiking skills. Priced at a fair amount.", "Wear these boots in construction all day. Comfortable with a extra felt insole. If you have narrow feet, they fit well. I like!", "These boots wore out in 4 months. They fell apart. Only hiked in them once a week. Bad product!", "Great looking boots. They feel very sturdy & appear to provide good ankle support. However, if you have wide feet, these boots may be too narrow. I read this on many reviews, but decided to try them anyway. Yep, the reviews were right. I ordered a Wide boot 1/2 size up, but the toe box was still too cramped. I had to return the boots. The good news is that Amazon had free returns on these, so it didn't cost me anything to try them. If they fit your foot, I'd highly recommend these for a sturdy lightweight boot.", "Great boots! Both my husband and my son are very pleased with these boots.", "Very Comfortable Boots. Actually makes you want to walk more they are so comfortable. I wear a 10 1/2, and they fit pretty good, but I do not lace my boots tight.", "I wear a 12 narrow in dress shoes and tennis shoes. I ordered these as a 12 narrow and they fit perfectly! They are lightweight and comfortable. Vasque has a new loyal customer!", "This is a very nice boot that I find runs a little small. Very comfortable from the start. I would have given it 5 stars but the black rubber on the toe peels off too easily. I am not sure if this will continue.", "Husband loves these. They are his 2nd pair because he walks a lot. He is usually 9 1/2 but the 10 fits well with a gel insert.", "Most comfortable Boot I have, would but another pair if these wear out", "Once I got the right size, had to go up one half size, I am very pleased. Very comfortable and really give you confidence on uneven terrain. Vortex works perfectly, but does not make the boot warm with heavy use. Would by this boot again.", "This is a wonderful boot.. well made and seems very sturdy to me. Unfortunately, Vasque has decided to make the Size Medium less than a medium... so they did not fit me. Note: I usually wear a Wide shoe but have worn Vasque Mediums over the years.", "Bottoms of shoes are slippery on wet surfaces...kinda defeats the purpose.", "Vasque makes one of the few hiking boots in a narrow size. This is my second pair and were bought as a backup to the first. There are many miles with heavy backpacks already logged on the first with many more miles left in them. I bought the new pair to start breaking them in, but very little break in is needed Great hiking boots.", "Please with fit but tried them on at a local store before buying on Amazon. Good thing I did because i needed size 10.5 instead of my usual 10. They fit and feel great except for one hotspot which I'm hoping will disappear once I break them in.", "Vasque Mens Breeze 2.0 - shoe length runs small so order at least 1/2 size larger than normal. Excellent boot, comfortable, wicks well, great arch support, and sole had great wear resistance on sharp rocky terrain. Has metal eyelets which survived two weeks in mountains where others shoes with plastic eyelets were broken. Overall very satisfied once size was established.", "My husband loves these & that price is better then going to the local stores", "I've worn the Vasque Clarion boot size 11 every day at work for more than a decade. Bummed that it has been discontinued. Since I've been so pleased with them over the years I wanted to stay with the Vasque name and ordered the Breeze 2.0. Recieved the size 11s and they were too small. Returned and bumped up half a size and still to small. Have size 12s on their way and my fingers are crossed.", "I would definitely purchase this boot again, my only complaint is the width of the boot should be available in wider sizes EE or EEE. They feel a little tight when you first put them on, but seem to conform to my feet rather quickly. I wear them all day long as a light weight work boot. I would give it a five star if it weren't for the size issue.", "Bought this pair of hiking boots for my son. Fits him well but yet to go for his hiking trip. But it looks like it will do the job and so far it seems like there will not be any need to break in the boots. Will update later after he has used it for his hiking trip. Updated with rating for condition so far.", "As an owner of Vasque boots previously I have high expectations whenever I buy new boots. These live up to every bit of my expectations. They are comfortable, rugged, waterproof and fit perfectly. In fact they fit so well that there was not one minute of break-in time, a real pain when you are on your feet for hours every day.", "these are now my primary hiking boot. I live in New Mexico, and most hiking, even on the best trails, involves a rocky trek. These boots have met the challenge and passed.", "I feared the worst when I through caution to the wind and purchased a pair of \"used\" boots. Thankfully they showed no indication of any prior wear and/or tear. I am thankful and very happy to own this pair of decent looking and nice feeling boots. Good traction, good support!", "Hit a stump and the inner shank that's around the feet bent and gave my feet hell could not fix it :(", "this product is comfortable, perfect for what I need it for", "My first pair of hiking boots! I've been tracking the price for a few months and finally the Grey ones went on discount! Definately would buy the grey over the brown! sturdy and waterproof! Comfy and excellent!", "Bought this for my Utah trip, walked on sand, climbed on rocks, walked in the rivers/narrows. Works perfectly fine. easy to clean as well", "Very comfortable right out of the box for a one hour hike.(I always insert \"Superfeet\" arch supports in all my boots). I'm strictly a day hiker on local horse trails so these boots are perfect for my needs. They're lightweight and cool yet feel very solid and sturdy on rocky or uneven terrain. This particular model was $45 cheaper than at a popular outdoor activity store.", "These boots have an extremely rugged build without compromising on comfort. Excellent traction be it on the sandstones of Utah or the rocky granite of NH. Great waterproofing and insulation.", "Tried on and got right sizing at REI then purchased for $50 less through Amazon. 150 miles on them now and not even a \"break in\" blister.", "These replaced my normal combat boots. What an incredible difference. I highly recommend these to anyone looking to hike or hike with a load. I tested them at 5 miles with 55lbs and like hiker thorlo socks. Feet never felt better", "I have found this Vasque boot always fits me very well and has less than a few hours of break in before it is fully comfortable. GREAT VALUE.", "My boyfriend hiked the grand canyon, from North Rim to South Rim and he was the only one who didn't get a single blister!! He loved these boots.", "I really liked these boots. But the sole came apart much quicker than I thought it would.", "Just wore out my last pair of Vasque breeze boots on the Nankoweap trail in the Grand Canyon after many miles together. I was pleased to find this pair at a great price. They fit extremely well and I started wearing them on day one! Having grown up with the 1970's era boots that took months to break in (if they ever did), I really appreciate the quality and fit in these boots.", "Not at all waterproof, not even to 2\u201d of water. Very light and good but NOT waterproof.", "These boots fit tight and snug. They are very comfortable. I tried them out in loose dirt on a very steep hillside and they did not slip. I love them. Thank you.", "Seem well built. This is my second pair of roughly the same boot. I purchased this pair because the first pair fit like a glove and have lasted 15 years. This pair seems a little stiff but time will tell. I give my first pair five stars.", "Perfect fit size 12 . One day of wear in the snow , great traction and kept my feet warm . Unknown long term wear and durability . Happy out of the box", "Make sure of your size in this boot before buying online (try them on at a local store first), I didn't & got black toenails from a hike at Havasupai. Great boot, bought a second pair that are a 1/2 size bigger and gave the others to a friend.", "Purchased these in a wide and the toe box was still too narrow for my wide feet. If you have normal or narrow feet these will probably be good. Other than them being too narrow, I liked the design and look of the boots.", "Super comfortable. I have Vasque Juxt shoes and love them, these are as comfortable, support the ankle and are water resistant. Haven't had them but a few weeks, so can't talk about there toughness.", "Very comfortable from the first time putting them on and love the speed laces on the side. So far (only had them a week) I've been on two hikes in them and am impressed with how good they feel. Am already looking at buying some regular Vasque hiking shoes for this summer too!", "This is a very early review, based on only 1/2 day in these boots. Overall comfortable, not much arch support, which is great for my flat foot. Wider than some toe boxes, but not an 'altra' ultra wide. Seem of good build quality. Simple lacing system works well. Medium stiffness in footbed.", "This boot is Awesome! The price is well worth it especially compared to other footwear with all its technical built-in benefits and really its good quality construction.....what take boot!\ud83d\ude06", "I have very narrow feet, so I bought the narrow width. The boots were still a little wide for me. But after I inserted my arch support insoles, they fit great, and there's almost no break-in needed.", "I haven't really tested these yet in terms of hiking. Still breaking in a bit, but the fit was great out of the box. As some of the other reviews noted, they run a bit small and I ordered a half size larger than I normally wear. Comfortable, light weight. No complaints. I may update after some wear in the woods.", "Love these boots. Amazon\u2019 value can\u2019t be beat. Got them for 1\u20442 of what department stores are charging (with an additional 25% off coupon from Amazon). They are some of the best, most comfortable hiking/hunting boots I own.", "I wear a narrow, and these are the best boots I've ever owned in terms of fit and quality of materials and workmanship. LOVE em. They run a wee bit small, you may want to go 1/2 size up, but it's a coin flip.", "I've worn Vasque hiking boots for about three years now. They're always comfortable and have held up well so far. I always go with boots with Vibram soles. I haven't tested these boots for water proofness as yet.", "Just got them and right out the box did hikes at Mr. Rainier of 8 and 13 miles. No blisters, and comfortable. Got the wide based on reviews and they were perfect for me. Waterproof was great.", "It's a super comfortable boot that I wore all day right out of the box. They appear to be very well made and look sharp. Time will tell on the durability of the boots. They seem very promising with regards to durability.", "Husband has worn this make of boot for a number of years, but for some reason the width on this design is narrower than other models. He has always work a 10.5 wide (E) but these, after about 2 weeks, have become painful to wear. They feel fine when you try them on but are too snug to walk in all day. Not a good thing for a hiking boot.", "This is my 3rd pair of these boots and I love them. I do a lot of urban walking and put LOTS of miles on them. Very comfortable and very supportive.", "The redesigned Vasque Breeze feels a little more narrow than the previous model. Prospective purchasers may want to consider moving to the wide vs. medium size. I have hiked in Vasque Breeze's for years and love them--light weight and breathable with good support.", "Fit great. Got them in the mail 2 days before a 85+ mile hike in the High Sierra. Great fit and only one little hot spot (not bad for 20+ miles a day). I was very impressed and happy with my purchase. I am an avid hiker and found these to be completely waterproof and quite cool. Someone stole my last pair of Vasques and I don't know why I waited to long to get another pair.", "these were about a size too small despite being labeled an 8.5 (which I wear comfortably). had to send them back.", "I can't say enough about these boots. I wore them for 11 days backpacking at Philmont. They remained waterproof and comfortable. I wore these in conjunction with Thorlo Coolmax light hiker socks, without liners. I did not get any blisters. The boots handled the streams, rain, and rocks very well.", "Outstanding lightweight hiking boot. Took these up to southern part of JMT, and went to top of Mt Whitney. Very little break in was required for these boots and I was blister free the whole week. I did not encounter the lack of traction on wet surfaces in other reviews. Couldn't be more pleased.", "Extremely comfortable fit. You don't even know your wearing boots.", "Comfortable. Warm. Cool. Waterproof. Great support. Well made. Anything else you need in a hiking boot? On, yea. Excellent value.", "My second pair. Break in takes a bit, but to be expected. Seems a tad warmer than my last pair, but not enough to be a problem. Super lightweight but rugged. Great boot.", "I hike everyday with my dogs for an hour. As expected, the boots have been amazing. Not much of a break-in period. There pretty new so my feet are not getting wet. Eventually the water does get through the membrane, but I have a few hundred miles left to start seeing that happening. I hike around 600 miles a year. The boots last a little over a year when you hike that amount. The constant dry to wet cycle blows out the leather, but that's normal.", "I have owned many pairs of boots, and several pairs of Vasque's. These are the best yet, and if they live as long as my previous pairs I will be extremely happy. The shank makes walking over rock points a breeze.", "Lightweight and comfortable It took a few wearings to get them broken in - very stiff out of the box. I typically wear an 8.5 and ordered up to a 9. Good with light Sox but tight with wool Sox.", "I like the look and build quality of this boot. My wife and children all have this boot and it fits them very well. My feet just don't seem to be the right shape for Vasque.", "Probably good for someone with normal feet. Not got for wide feet and toe of boot gets narrow/angled. Keen's fit way better.", "Great shoes, but the right one puts a lot of pressure on my little toe. Maybe just needs a bit more breaking in...but they hurt pretty good first couple times. I haven't worn them much, really hoping these will break in nicely.", "They took some time to wear in, but have hiked 22 rocky miles and my feet were not the issue (the rest of my body, on the other hand...)", "Wore them all day on a practice hike with a 50lb backpack. Feet were comfy and dry all day (can't say the same for my legs & back though).", "Sadly, these boots are too narrow. Usually a size 14 medium fits me fine. These should fit with hiking socks but do not. They must be returned.", "I have hiked in the Vasque Breeze boots for several years. Each new pair fits like they are already broken in, but I wear them for some time before hiking a more difficult trail. I am very pleased.", "Great price for a known great boot. I hike 5-10 miles often and only in these boots. Also wear them to follow the grandson college golfer for 18 holes or about 5 miles often.", "Comfortable hiking shoes. I am glad that I bought it without hesitation when they were briefly on sales.", "Super boots, holding up well, fit well, can wear all day long with comfort.

They look great and fit well but the best part is they are light weight great for all day use.", "The boots have now been put to the test in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, and have passed effectively. They are almost a 5 star rating, but I feel a little discomfort with the tongue on the right. Overall though, they were comfortable, with good grip for hikes on both wet and dry terrain.", "Even thought I have only had them for a week and use them for work I am in hopes they will last as long as my last pair of Vasques. On an average I wear them 12 to 16 hours a day 5 days a week ... I have been through all the name brand work boots and 8 to 10 months is all the longer they last but my last of Vasques lasted over 2 1/2 years. They feel great and my feet don't hurt and the end of the day.", "I purchased these boots for spring - fall camping, working around the woods and any hiking trips. Very surprised at how light and comfortable they feel. Warmer than expected with the Goretex, but not uncomfortable or overly sweaty.

Would definitely recommend to a friend.", "Light weight and fairly good traction from the soles. Not enough time on them to tell how they will last.

Took a while to find them again.", "Very professional shipment, item arrived in great shape and was well manufactured. I wear 10 1/2 shoes and ordered a size 11 boot which turned out to be too small.

I returned them and bought a pair of North-face.", "I would order these a little wider then advertised. Very well made except did a lot of walking on damp cobble stones and the soles were very slippery, had to take care when walking on them.", "This is my second pair and they are fantastic!

I am 5'8\" 175 pounds Very comfortable for being a hiker with a backpack up to 40 pound.

Short breaking period. They are truly waterproof. Good grip on mud, scree and good performance in any trail. Good toe protection. Be careful in wet floor.", "I first used these boots while hiking in Glacier National Park, and they performed very well. They provide great ankle support and breath extremely well on the trail. My previous Vasque boots lasted over 20 years.", "Great overall hiker, good looking. But, run on the hot side.

Fast shipping.", "I bought these boots for my boyfriend. He absolutely loves this brand and will not wear anything else. These are his third pair, and they are exactly as advertised and the size is the perfect fit for him. He plans to get plenty of wear out of his new boots and the old ones as well.

So far, 2 weeks, they are perfect...", "The arches are a tad low, but otherwise these boots are great.

So far so good , very good fit off the bat!!", "The new version of the Vasque Breeze is not as good as the previous model. The toebox is tighter, and it seems sizing is running about 1/4 - 1/2 size smaller than the previous model. The rigid toe protector on the front is OK for durability of the boot, but it does not allow for any flexibility or breaking in of the toebox area - which can cause problems for toes being cramped or even uncomfortably bumping into the front of the boot.", "I love this shoe. Although it gave me blisters it's solid. Once I broke it in I didn't get any more blisters. I wear this for all my hikes and all my rainy days.", "I made the mistake of wearing the wrong size boot before and lots both big toenails. There are awesome. Fits perfect and feet are not tired at all after a hike. Mainly use for when I go hunting. They are waterproof which is a must for me.", "These are very comfortable and light. I've only got a couple hikes in with these so far though they've held up well through a variety of conditions.

I hope the Breeze 3's carry on the tradition.", "I had about 4 pairs of the original Vasque breeze and was disappointed when they discontinued.

Could be just the pair I got.", "Vasque Breeze model hiking boots have been my favorite for a long time (and many pairs) for many years. Very light, great soles and no breaking in needed.", "I ordered these as an everyday shoe and it serves fine in that capacity. It isn't really robust enough to serve years and years as a hiking boot but I didn't expect it to. It is probably a size 11 instead of 11.5 which is annoying. If ordering again, I would choose a 12 to get the correct length. Width seems okay.", "Fits perfectly and feels great. I've been wearing them for about a week with no blisters or soreness. I mow grass everyday and usually have back pain but since I started wearing them my pain has gone down.", "I had the same boot. Same size. And these are not the same.

I like them and will buy more.", "I'm an avid Hiker and on my feet a lot in real life. This is my THIRD pair these boots. I have flat feet, weak ankles, lower back issues and I'm 65 years old.

Feel like tennis shoes with ankle support. I'm not looking for any other brand, these work and I'm not switching!", "I highly recommend them.

I haven't been hiking yet. So far all is good.", "I bought a pair of Vasque Breeze 1.0 GTX three years ago and retired them just a few months ago.

Second one for my dad - still in use. Can't go wrong here.", "I bought this boot because it's good for day-hikes, as well as backpacking (or around town!). They are nice and light. They provide great support throughout the foot and ankle. They are true to size. The rubber on the toe and heel are nice since I experience wear and tear in those areas. The tongue area was a bit uncomfortable at first (pinching), but it didn't take long to break-in. Overall, these are a pleasure to slip my feet into.", "These boots are light weight, have a good vibram sole and don't crowd my toes. Very comfortable and highly recommended", "Buy 1 size bigger.

I reordered 13W, and they fit fine, even in length. So far, I like the boots. I have only worn them once on a short (4 mile) easy hike. Although it was wet and muddy, my feet stayed dry. I have yet to step in a puddle or have them rained on. They are comfortable, provide ankle support, and have good traction.

Working great with my orthodics. Will be good in any summer weather here in Colorado. Thanks", "I ordered these for my husband. He picked them because he had another pair of Vasque Day Hikers and was extremely pleased with them; although he bought them at a local retailer and paid quite a bit more for them.

Ordered another pair and am sending back these.", "This is an excellent product. I will order them again.", "I order my Vasque boots a 1/2 size larger than my normal shoe size and the wide (2EE) width. The boots fit just fine since size wise.

One daughter lives in Boston (endless snow this year) and she is wearing her boots constantly having discovered that she no longer slips & slides, rather she says she is \"CRUSHING\" snow & ice AND that her feet are finally WARM!

I loved my former pair of Vasque Breeze boots, and they saw miles and miles of hiking trails and hunting through the rough mountains of Northern Arizona. These new, updated boots are even better. They fit more comfortably, are easier to lace up and are possibly even lighter than my old pair. Plus, they have the incomparable GoreTex waterproof lining. As long as they are a good fit for your foot you can't ask for a better pair of rugged, all weather boots for your outdoor needs.", "I bought this boot in 2005. I've loved them I used them in summer and winter. They last for me 3-4 years, so when the were well-worn I bought a second pair. These are my third pair.

In Northern California that's not too often. But I dug them out the other day for walking the dog in downpour and when I tightened the laces the lug broke off, rendering the shoes useless.

I disappointed in the longevity of the product.", "I ordered these boots a half size larger than my normal size, but they were too tight. If I were to order them again I would try a full size larger. I think the problem was primarily with the width. These were Wides, but my even though my width is 2E they seemed not wide enough even at a half size larger.

REI did not have the color I wanted, so I bought it on line. I've used these for 3 weeks of very tough day hikes in the mountains (Dolomites & Scottish Western Highlands).

I bought these to replace my worn out Breeze GTX. I simply cannot believe the poor quality of the new Breeze 2.0. Far less padding and comfort in this boot.

Within a few hours of wearing them my little toe on the right foot was hurting. I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll stretch a bit. It\u2019s just not worth the time and effort to send them back.

Wish I could return them, but my trip was delayed and I am stuck with them. Vasque used to make a great hiking boot and I have had several pairs over the years.

Turns out, their boot styles do not all fit alike.", "Bought these for my husband. He has tried them on and said they were comfortable, but we have not been hiking since they came, so he doesn't know how they will do yet on the long term.

I have Vasque hiking boots and I like mine very much.", "After less than a year(and very minimal wear) this boot has developed a crease in the side that has caused a bump inside and my son cannot wear them anymore. You would think something this expensive and with the name of Vasque, they would perform better. Very disappointed!", "These boots are very comfortable. I went up a half a size based on someone's recommendation, glad I did. Easy to walk around in, the only thing I found is that on smooth surfaces, when wet these are a bit slippery. \"Smooth Surfaces\" as in tiled floor, coated concrete floors, hard wood floors.

This is my fourth pair over the last ten plus years.", "As many others have mentioned, these boots tend to run a bit small. I normally wear a 10, but I ordered these in 10.5 and they fit perfectly.

The only way to make them work is thin socks and shorter periods of where.", "I've owned 2 pairs of the \"1.0\" Breeze GTX's before buying the 2.0. The toe is the biggest difference, both pairs of the 1.0's would always get a ding that would never go back to normal. The 2.0 has a covering that protects from this. I've also noticed the tongue has alot less padding compared to the 1.0's. The design and color are an improvement in my opinion. They just look better. Overall the picture and the size was spot on for me and hold up great to Afghanistan deployment conditions. I'd recommend this boot to anyone that wants a sturdy waterproof boot for every day wear.", "I think this is the best pair of boots I have owned -- and I have used many brands.

Boots are very well made,9I don't care if it's made in China LOL) The unfortunate part is they are to narrow for my wide feet. There for with a heavy hart, only three stars and a trip back to Amazon.

Do it.", "The boot seems to be ok. I'll let you know in a couple of weeks.", "Traction was absolutely terrible, especially on wet rocks.

Too tight in the toes. 3/7/14 - Update - gave three stars initially now giving one. Toe cap separating from upper and a totally sloppy fit now.

Go to any court where there are lots of old guys, who have flattened out their feet with decades of tennis, and look at the brand shoes they're wearing--the majority are NB. But now you can take a brand new pair of NB 4E shoes from a few years ago, and compare to the same width in any current NB shoe, and the difference is stark. The toe box on the new one will always be way narrower. So much narrower that guys like me--a regular 4E--just can't wear them. Why would they do this?

However long before I can wear out the shoe's glue give out and the bottom and rear sides start coming apart. It is a not so fun game of gluing them back together to get some life out of them.

I will get back if something does go wrong, but I am not expecting any issues with this shoe.", "I bought this shoe looking for a shoe with more room in the toe box. Well this shoe had it, except that it's designed as if your foot is literally a rectangle. It had enough room for my toes, but it was so loose around the midfoot and heel that it was pretty much unusable. I tried for about a week and a half until I turned my ankle playing tennis on what should have been a routine step because my feet were sliding around so much in the shoe. Have now abandoned them.

The fit and build have been consistently good. I have experienced on two pair the thin outer sole separating around the edges in a few places, I repaired this with some Shoe-Goo and they worked fine but I do hope they eliminate this fabrication flaw.

After wearing them out playing Pickleball I ordered another pair exactly in the exact same size.

I play on a similar hard court surface and the shoes provide good support and cushioning and the soles show no wear after 20 hours of play.", "I like these shoes a lot. I picked these for their width and general comfort. These are the third pair I\u2019ve owned as I use them to play Pickleball daily. I\u2019ve also added insoles for my own comfort. Many other of my Pickleball playing friends wear them as well. I do wish they came in other colors than just white.", "I tried the largest size I normally wear -- not all brands and models fit the same -- and found them a bit short and too narrow in the toe.

Original fit felt a little tight but think after wearing for a while all will be fine. Quality seems very good.", "My latest order is my third pair of this same make and model. I think that says it all. I am hard to fit at 15 (4E) and so, when I find a shoe that fits, I stick with it. If I have even one minor nit, it is that the heals wear down faster than any other part of the shoe.", "I have always had good luck with New Balance shoes . This pair of mc806 has the same good solid feel as other NB shoes. However, within months the sole literally started falling apart (see pictures). I only wore them 4-5 times. Not sure why NB would make such a great solid shoe and skimp on the sole. It is a thin piece of rubber that didn't hold up at all. Of course, my Amzaon return window closed two weeks ago, so I am out $104. Also looked for a way to contact the seller on Amazon, but there was no link.", "This is one of the few tennis sneakers (and even casual shoes) for which the narrow width is really narrow. My shoe size is 12B, but most sneakers and casual shoes labelled as narrow, feel more like a C width. These fit perfectly snug, and I may even go back to thinner socks. All of the performance aspects of the sneaker are great. It gives a great feel for the court when playing on Har-Tru, breathes well, and gives great support.", "Unfortunately, the cost cutting is apparent compared to the old 804s, and in some really stupid ways. The sole and lowers seem to be identical, but the uppers are where they cut. The tongue has been shortened and there are fewer lace holes, not sure if the laces themselves were shortened, but it would seem so. The only probable reason for doing that is to cut the weight as much as possible as it is cetainly not any cheaper to buy. Still a great tennis shoe, but it disappoints if you knew its predecessor.", "This is a good product I have used for many years.

There is a 2 inch tear along the left side of the left-foot shoe...just in front of the N.", "My foot is slightly wide and the 2E fit perfectly.

I wear either a 9 1/2 or 10, both as wide as I can find. I went with a 10 on the premise that I would wear a heavier, more cushioned sock. My plan worked out as anticipated. I've only worn them a couple of times - we'll see how they hold up.", "For me, great comfy shoe. No break-in period required. Some tennis shoes are very stiff and you wear them around the house for weeks or you only play in them for so long them switch on a changeover back to older pair.

I've been using them since I had a sprained ankle. This is my second pair. They are kind of heavy.", "I need a shoe with good arch support and some extra room for my toes, and this shoe has both. This is my shoe for all around casual wear, and I like it. This is my third pair.", "In only three months and used sparingly, both shoes make a clicking sound when walking. It appears that the soles will be separating from the shoes. Poor quality.", "Hubby orders the same sneakers over and over. These seem to float his boat.", "Ordered these for my husband in June 2014 as he has been wearing New Balance for years and always found them to be both comfortable and supportive in his size, which can be hard to find, 11 4E. Previously, quality was excellent. By August 2014 ... TWO MONTHS!!! ... shoes are falling apart. Like many others have noted, New Balance quality has gone to ***!** Why pay over $100 for shoes that don't even last TWO MONTHS?!

Great fit out of the box, look forward to their playability.....", "Honestly the worst fitting pair of new balance I've bought and I've had tons of them through the years. Am an RN, so need comfortable shoes. These are not it. They feel fake tbh because I've never had a pair of new balance fit this bad.", "My knee stopped hurting after switching to these shoes. I'm so happy that my knee isn't hurting that I don't care at all that they're kind of ugly.", "Great shoe for Pickleball. Fix was perfect, great stability. The only problem I see with the shoe is the sole wears out pretty quick. I do play on hard courts but I\u2019m not sure if another shoe would hold up. I go for comfort and these shoes are great for that. I would give a 5 but the soles wear out to quick.", "I have had hit-and-miss luck with New Balance Wide shoes. I really like the 574 - their traditional sneaker - but size 12 2E in that shoe is _way_ too narrow for me. My previous New Balance shoe was the 940v2. I love the comfort and support but hate the look. These shoes look a little more traditional, and they fit exactly the same.", "Second pair I\u2019ve bought in 5 years.

Great wide fit - wish I could find more wide shoes like these.", "Great for pickleball! New balance is the only Tennis shoe", "Perhaps the only purpose built tennis shoe that comes in a narrow width.

They are exactly the same quality you would get in any department or shoe store. Original New Balance Quality! Thank You. Steven", "NB changed the toe box. Why ? I've mentioned it to a number of NB tennis players. Nobody can understand why. Critical error. Toes are pinched, painful.after 10 plus years I have to start looking again.NB had quite a large following of loyal customers in my world.Thats quickly dissolving . I'm sure by the time they \"see\" the numbers the person that screwed up the template will be long gone.

So I just ordered my second pair.", "My husband has very bad ankles and these offer decent support.", "I have a history of plantar fasciitis and play tennis 4 days per week. These court shoes give excellent arch support and shock protection and are comfortable, but I am glad I ordered one half size larger (as was recommended in other reviews) than I usually wear.

However, within two to three weeks seams on both shoes broke loose and made the shoes virtually worthless. Such pathetic and disappointing craftsmanship does not deserve a New Balance name.", "The last identique shows that I bought , the soles became unstuck after five months.

Old pair was starting to lose treads and was not as supportive. Used for almost daily tennis for six months.", "Perfect tennis shoe for an older player running on 2 joint replacements (me).

Something happened.", "I first bought this shoe in 4E and fitment was good until used in competition. It was then I realized that my foot was sliding around inside the shoe. So, I ordered the 2E and it is exactly what I expected. So, note to buyers. Be sure you are ordering the right width because they are true to the size. Also, if you normally buy a size up because most shoes are to narrow, I had to buy a half size down because of the true fit.", "Returned item. Apparently, made with different last than my other NB shoes. Although same size, this shoes has to small a toe box.", "Best fitting shoe I\u2019ve ever had for narrow width.

Now for a given size they are all too small, tight, I\u2019ll fitting. This was experienced on several versions.", "Ordered these to replace an older NB tennis shoe no longer available.

These were actually slightly thinner than my current shoe so I sent them back. I'm considering ordering the 4E.", "I wear them only for pickleball and so far I like them. Time will tell. A friend who has worn NB for years told me the other day that his most recent pair wore out quickly. My wife has a pair that fell apart after relatively little use. A local shoe store told my wife that NB aren't what they used to be.

The support and cushioning afforded by the I insoles is excellent", "A, B width is as close as I can get, custom boots are AA or A's. The biggest women's I have found are 13 A another half size bigger would be perfect. So these NB will do. I like the shoe", "This is a true tennis shoe. Designed for multiple court surfaces.

Great for the price!!", "Aside from the terrible shoe laces (stretch too easily and too long) the shoe remains my favorite for tennis.", "On my 4th pair. The most recent is bad, I think they injured my feet. In addition, the toe area is now too small. Also, the soles tear off, on account of the sorry glue they use. So long NB.", "One of the best court shoes available. Terrific support and right amount of cushioning.", "Almost as good as the MC803. 804 was so bad I played in my last pair of 803 until the sole fell off. Runs small: I had to order half a size larger than any other shoe I wear and still too small. Hard tie shield ts too narrow (pointy). New Balance has their U.S. Sizes really out of calibration. The last year or so I have had to order one to 1 1/2 sizes than any other brand.", "I didnt expect much, but these shoes exceeded my expectations. Great looking and VERY short break-in period. They dont have any arch support but thats fine my flat feet didnt want high uncomfortable arches.", "Although the 806 fits well, its durability is much less than desired. A pair of MC806's lasts about 3-5 months. Additionally, the 806 is the only shoe which fits me, this due to my 12.5 B size. NB offers a lot of shoes but only one tennis shoe that fits me. They should offer more choices in my size.", "I contacted New Balance asking for a suggestion for ankle support. I am a big guy and my shoes tend to lean to the sides after a couple of months. These stay level no matter what and are very comfortable.

I normally wear an E width but ordered these a EE and my toes are cramped. The shoes don't look as good in hand as online. I decided to keep them and hope that maybe it will stretch as I wear them.

I have had some size issue with most items made in Indonesia...", "I have been playing recreational tennis for many years and gone through a number of foot, ankle, toe etc injuries. After getting advice from shoe specialists, I settled on the 804 which is no longer available. This model is the updated version of of the 804 which works great for me.", "I have narrow feet and this is the only court shoe I can find that comes in my width. This is my fourth pair. The bad news is that they do not wear as well as I think they should. The leather upper stretches with time, making the shoe fit more like a medium than a narrow and the sole wears quickly. Given that this is the only shoe on the market that fits my foot, I will continue to purchase. The worn shoes do make great lawn mowing and gardening shoes.", "I guess I should have trusted bad reviews by other buyers. The shoe is tight in the toe box and seems to provide less heel cushion than previous 800 series court shoes.

They are excellent!", "Perhaps a little heavier than I would like but gives great support on the court.", "Great shoes for handball, but I use my own arch supports.

Too thin. I bought a good one.", "This pair if shoes was to small. My size is 11.5 4E as it has been for the last 10 pairs of shoes . The 806 was too tight in the arch area.

Solid performance on hard courts, clay (Har-Tru) and grass.", "These are my go-to shoes for singles tennis. Great traction and protection in a fairly light design.

Switching to other brands/models is a bit of a crapshoot.", "Good performing tennis shoe. My husband was fitted for these at the NB store, so he knew exactly what size to order.

The extra wide sizes fit those of us with wider feet - a real advantage over most other brands.", "Not sure if an official change was made but the toe box area of these shoes changed about a year ago. Maybe a change since they are no longer Made In USA. Was one of the reasons I bought NB shoes, but that has changed.", "I have worn New Balance tennis shoes for years. Literally decades. The 806 is the only model in my size 14B (Narrow). It's a good shoe. The stabilizer works well. It would need better cushioning and arch support to be great.", "New Balance my shoe for life. Product delivered perfect as expected", "This pair is my new tennis shoe. The 2 1/5 year old pair of the exact same shoe is now my gym shoe. Great shoe for a narrow foot.", "I was lowered my rating on previous review. But after tried Nike cage2 and babolat fsx Wimbledon , nb 806 is still the best option on market despite everyone agreed it's a lower quality than previous model. Babolat is a junk and made in paper. Don't even try it. Nike cage 2 can fit 4e wide feet like mine. It takes sometime to break in. If you are tired of nb, you can try it. The on court feeling is different and it last much longer than thin nb out sole. Nb give best comfort and room for toe. Feel great on court. Just can't last over a month on a five days a week play time.", "This is the only tennis shoe that I have found in a narrow width. Every other one comes in either wide or wider.", "Toe box of shoe is a little tighter than other new Balance shoes {like the 608].

I\u2019m enjoying playing tennis now.", "I\u2019ve been wearing this line of shoes for years. They have been consistently good and they fit so well since I have an extra wide foot. Great stability and surprisingly cool in the summertime.", "This is my second pair of MC806's. I only wear them when playing tennis and typically play 2-4 hours per week on hard-courts. The fit and support of these shoes are excellent. However, the soles wear out (flat) after 3-4 months of use. Be prepared to replace them frequently if you go with this model.", "Been buying this exact shoe for over ten years and never had a fit problem. This pair is shorter than before. My toes push out the end. Cannot wear after trying several times. What do I do now?", "Great show. I have a very wide foot and these shoes fit perfectly.

So, I ordered another 10D and couldn't get them on. I usually have these shoes for 2-3 years (playing once or twice a week). I had to exchange them for a 10.5D. I'll wait to see how these fit. Suddenly the sizing has shrunk. Another reviewer said the same thing, but I didn't believe them. Please believe them and get at least a half size larger.", "My husband says they are light, comfortable and supportive. He plays tennis, runs hard and has had trouble finding good shoes at a good price. We've even gotten another pair for back up.", "It was the rating that was closest. The fit, D, E, EE, EEEE, etc. was O.K. But, with New Balance, the sizing is the only strong thing going for them. Most other brands of tennis court shoes are better designed - KSwiss, Adidas, Babolat, to name a few, are better shoes. It's just that I have a foot problem that requires a wider fit, and New Balance offers width options.

I play racquetball and had been using NB 656 for a couple of years\u2014soles never peeled off of 656s, and they were much less expensive. Two stars because the shoes were good while they lasted, durable materials protected my feet from toe drag and racquet hits. But the short lifespan and high price make this shoe a bad choice. Because NB currently has nothing else to offer in the $75 price range (656 are discontinued), I moved on to trying Nikes.

It can be tough on players and equipment. These shoes hold up well and provide a nice barrier between the heat of the court and my feet.

I have been a New Balance wearer since 1991, but I'm about to give up on this brand. What's up New Balance?", "This is the worst tennis shoe, or sneaker, I have ever worn. It offers no arch support or cushioning, no shape. It's almost like wearing sandals on the court. My old, beat up 654s ($54) feel 100% better than these shoes. To put salt in the wound, they are $104 for a cheap, shoddy product. New Balance used to make fine shoes. Now they are junk. They should change their name to NO BALANCE as that is how you will feel if you try to play tennis with these shoes.

I wear them for tennis, then immediately change shoes after the match", "I used these for squash only. In a short period of time, the gray part of the sole started breaking off. Also, the same gray part of the sole became unfixed. I had to re-glue twice with crazy glue and leave in a vice overnight to get the remaining gray sole to adhere to the rest of the sole. Decent arch support Would much prefer higher arch support!!!!", "Within less then one year the sole came apart. The comfort of the short has a hard feel. I have replaced them with a pair of Nike Air Monach shoes. The Nike's are definitely a more comfortable shoe then the New Balance MC806. Time will tell if they hold up.", "I concur with other's comments relative to both the overall width of the shoe and the toe box. I have worn New Balance for several years, especially the 806. So, I naturally ordered another pair of the 806 and to my surprise the fit was entirely different. I cannot account for the uncomfortable fit but I began to get both heel pain and toe pain. I have given up even trying to stretch the shoe. Unfortunately, I will have to look for another brand. I can only assume the difference has to do with new styling or poor quality control in the manufacturing process!!!", "While this shoe wears evenly, the stability component under the heal is hard sharp plastic. This \"rollbar technology\" will slice your ankle if it ever comes in contact with it. I have tried socks that cover my ankles and but the doesn't matter if the plastic barely touches my ankle, it will slice it like a knife.", "It seems that NB has succumbed to becoming just another me too shoe company. Can't blame them based on how well Nike has done. As others have stated this shoe quality has been downgraded in many aspects. It's also wider and more voluminous than previous generations. Time will tell with regard to how well they hold up over time. I don't play tennis in them so hopefully they will be OK.", "I should have listened to all the reviews that warned me that the shoe would be too tight. They were correct. This is not a size 4E.

These are very cushy and soft. They do run on the smaller side. I wear a pretty standard 8, so I ordered an 8-9. If I planned to wear them outside, they are way too small, but will work for my need. Also, very lightweight if you want to take to the gym or beach.", "Wearing these shoes when taking showers at the gym is essential. They are light, so it makes it really easy to just throw them in your gym bag without adding weight, but comfortable enough that you can wear them while you shower and then wear them home if you don't want to put your feet back into shoes. Better than flip flops as you don't have to make sure your toes are in the right place-just slide them on. Just dry them off and they are ready for your next trip to the gym.", "Okay, before buying. I went through a lot of reviews before deciding on which shower shoes I wanted. 1. Yes, you have to pick one size up. My feet are size 8 or 8.5 and I ordered a 9/10. It perfectly for my 8.5 feet. 2.

I could have gotten a size 41 and they may fit a little better. But I ordered them for after I come out the shower so they'll work ok. They are on the rather light and flimsy side.

They are light weight and comfortable but extremely sturdy and do not wear down like many other pair of summer shoes I\u2019ve owned (including expensive Nike and Teva). I even wear them instead of slippers. Extremely versatile foot wear that easily transition from house shoes to futzing around town. Truly comfortable right out of the bag. Best part, when they get dirty, I throw them right in the washer and bleach them with my whites (every color I own) and they come out looking brand new. Amazingly durable, remarkably wearable. These shoes are indestructible.", "I love these super cheap and easy women's shower slippers. Recently joined our fabulous new YMCA and I've been using the steam room and showers and sauna and to keep up with top hygiene, I like to wear slippers in the shower.

They were a bit small for a 10 but I assumed they would stretch a bit and they did. However, this pair, though marked as a 10, fits more like an 8. I will give them away and not buy any more. It's my experience with items made in China and other similar countries that they don't have a real 10. Some are honest about this, but others apparently simply mark smaller items as a ten and send them on their way to our country. The shoe itself is ok but doesn't do me any good, thus the one star.", "I bought these shoes to wear at the pool, to protect my feet in the locker room, the showers, and on the concrete. The traction is great, no slipping around on locker room tiles. I wear them in the shower and they dry out very quickly at home. I wear an 8 1/2 W shoe. The 9/10 fits really well.

Highly recommend!", "Liked these so much I ordered 4 more pair! However, if your shoe size is at the higher level of the size (e.g. you're a 6 not a 5) order the next size up if you want a roomier fit. Otherwise, the 5/6 did fit my size 6 foot.

I normally wear a 7.5, in my horseback riding boots (the only time I wear) an 8. So, I order a 7-8. When I was standing, they seemed to fit. As soon as I took one step, my heel slipped backwards and completely out of the sandal...they obviously didn't fit me right. Regardless of that, when standing, they were SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE! Hard as a rock and I couldn't imagine wearing these for 5 minutes.", "I ordered this in my regular size, but it was at least a half-size too small. Seemed like an okay shoe otherwise.

The fit was snug but comfortable. I was happy and ready to wear them out to the hot tub when Isaw all the grease marks on the LEFT sandal. The RIGHT on was brand new and clean as a whistle.

It will not stop me from wearing them. I wear a 9 and that's what I ordered. There is no room at all so if you wear anything bigger than a 9 you might want to size up. OK so I went camping this weekend.. Let me say .. I LOVE THEM! they are my favorite camping shoes now.. I plan to buy more in different colors.. Thank you so much!", "I use these for the shower at the gym. Lightweight, I never feel like I'm going to slip in them, and they stay on my feet good. The little nubs inside I thought would annoy me, but they actually feel pretty good. The only issue I had with them is water somewhat pools inside the sandal, but it's minor. I've even worn these to the store and around because they look good to scuff around in.", "These shoes are perfect for use in the shower or at the beach. They are so comfy, I wear them all day around the house. I find that they are the best slipper to keep in my suit case for travel as they are lightweight and easy to pack. In fact, I bought an extra pair for just this reason. Great product. Highly recommend.", "My daughter has worn them all summer as a lifeguard at a water park. That means constantly on her feet 'roaming' & wet from walking in the shallows. These shoes held up & don't smell at all. My son bought under armor slides to be cool & his smell awful no matter how much Lysol we spray on them or sunshine they sit in. These slides are worth every penny. But do size up. She is a solid 9 & the 9/10 just fit her.", "They were very comfortable. Only minor negative I had was that the inside sole (where your foot goes), is a little slick/shiny. Haven\u2019t tried them with wet feet, but I am guessing foot might slip within the shoe a little bit, when feet are wet.", "Bottom (where your feet go) is 'slippery' so it's difficult to walk (have to 'grip' hard with toes). Needs some sort of grip where the bottom of your feet go. I haven't worn them but once because of this.", "These do tend to run a bit small. I'm an 8-8.5, and I'm glad I got the 8-9 because my toes and heel are at the ends of this shoe. If I were a 9, I'd probably order a size up. Great for slip resistance. May not be good if you have wide or \"tall\" feet as these aren't super roomy, but that's a good thing to help with slip resistance. They are super lightweight. Great value for the price.", "I am currently having trouble with the cold, flat tile of the shower - it creates pain right up my leg bones. These slides don't slip and provide the cushion I need to protect my feet/legs from the cold. I tried a pair of flip flops - very surprised when they slipped as I got out of the shower. So the slides do just as I had hoped. Great product/low price!", "Ordered these with low expectations to use around the house and I\u2019m extremely impressed.

Almost like I\u2019m getting a foot massage every time I slide them on.", "These slide-on sandals are incredibly comfortable and soft. They are just every so slightly smaller than the stated size but fit well enough for shower shoes at the gym. Be careful when removing the plastic tie and tag.

I'd buy another pair of these to have for the beach.", "I just like to keep a pair of slip on shoes next to the door so I can go outside in the yard (I'm usually in just sox in the house).

I would say the 6/7 is actually a 6.", "Size 40 (Ladies 9/10) fits more like a solid 9. The logo was smudged badly on one of the slides.

For the price (and for the availability in the middle of winter), I can't complain too much.", "Ordered 37 and fits like 35. Overall quality is good. I have to a friend who is size 35 and fits her perfectly, not an ounce larger. A good shower slippers.", "These run super small I ordered a size bigger and they were still small. I love the shoe though. I gave it to my friend with small feet.", "These are great. I'd like some other color options, but beyond that, no complaints! Very soft on the feet, supportive and very comfortable. A little bit of rubbing where big too meets the main part of foot, but nothing a small band aide can't cure.

I originally bought a pair for a cruise I went on.Since then, I have purchased two more pairs.I wear them to work, as slippers, to garden in and any other reason I can come up with.

They are very light and they massage your feet gently. I would am ordering several more of these.", "Loved them but they ran a little small, I got them and packed them for my vacation without trying then on.

They fit me perfectly, and feel very comfortable on my feet. The bottom is very nice as it has just enough grip to make it not slippery. For $5 you really cannot go wrong!!!", "I loved the fit of these; however, I had to return them because they did not have a size 41! I was so disappointed! If you have wide feet though these may not work for you because there wasn't much wiggle room for my foot, which I like but may not work for some people!", "I like to leave this pair by my back door to change to when I do yard work. My regular shoes always, always gets mud on the bottom. So now I don't have to keep cleaning them.", "Great deal. These are slightly narrow but otherwise fit my 7.5 size foot. They do give me blisters. If you intend to take these on a beach vacation, don\u2019t! They are good for the gym shower & use at public pools. They drain fine & don\u2019t keep my feet wet.", "The sandals are attractive, durable, and comfortable even on bad feet. They are very reasonably priced. I have a pair in every color and a couple in black. I live in FL and wear them outside--to the store, the movies, visiting friends. They can handle outdoor walking.", "I ordered a size larger than I normally wear. Got these and they were too small and nowhere near wide enough. I gave them to a person with a really narrow foot. These are not true to size. Beware.", "They are non-slip in the shower and easy to slip on and off. They run small. The largest size fits my 9.5 foot snuggly. I have wide feet and it is a decent fit but they do run a bit small.", "These are so comfortable. Wear them all day long. Eases back pain. I wont be without a new pair waiting. 5 star", "I purchased these for my daughter who was going to college! She wanted slippers that she could wear in the shower that were cute and of course none slip. I took a chance ordering these for her and to my surprise she love them!

I use them to slip into to take the dogs out at night. Feel good and are lightweight. So easy to wear. My only complaint is that it took a little longer than expected to receive them but he sandal itself is great.", "I wish I would have ordered a size up.

I really recommend these sandals to anyone who is looking for comfy sandal that you can shower in, these are for you!", "love these shower / gym sandals... i bought these for the shower at the gym and they are perfect. in fact they are so comfortable i wear them around our condo also. They are pretty, light, dry very fast and fit the bill.

HIghly recommend.", "Purchased these for my wife. She wears an 8 wide or 8.5 med shoe. I first purchased the 8-9. She said they were too narrow and a little small. I sent them back and ordered the 9-10. She likes the 9-10, although they are not big at all. If there was a size larger than the 9-10 I would have ordered those but the 9-10 will work. Order at least a size up.", "For about the $12 I paid they have performed as expected. No slip on wet floors at the gym pool and locker room. They have lasted fairly well with use four times a week to they gym pool. They are comfortable and are very walkable.", "They fit great, and the color is exact! The only issue I had was I bought them to keep my feet dry, so I would dry my feet off before putting them in the sandal, but then condensation would make them slippery even if the room was not very hot, which can be a hassle and makes funny noises. They work, though, so I am going to keep them!", "Bought these as slippers to wear around the house and they're so comfortable that I almost left the house wearing them on one occasion. I bought the pink to be funny because I thought they'd be loudly garish, but they're actually kinda cute. I definitely recommend them for the price.", "Eve though it fits snugs, it is a comfortable enough pair of sandals to wear at home. Wear them instead of house slippers.", "Personal use. Love them.

I wear a size 9 and would have ordered a size larger.", "I wear a size 8 and have slightly narrow feet. The 39 fit like a dream! The shower sandal stays put on my feet and does not slide around. They are also very cushiony and dry quickly. Great buy!", "Perfect slide for showers at the pool or campground. Lightweight, cushioned & waterproof. I usually wear an 8.5 but based on other reviews I ordered down a half size. I have a wider foot with shorter toes, so the size 8 works well for me. They are a little snug in the toe box but they do stretch with wear. If you have longer toes, you might want to stick with your originally size.", "Keep these at the back door to slip on walking around in the yard etc. I have worn them out a few times. Great value", "My mother raved about these shoes (she has two pairs). She keeps one pair in the shower, and the other in her bedroom. So I got a pair for myself, and they are very light, and I like the soft \"bumps\" massaging the soles of my feet (unlike the massaging hard spots on Crocs which can irritate sensitive skin).", "I normally wear a 35 (European, 5ish American) and these fit me perfectly despite being size 36 (6ish). I bought them just to be shower shoes, but they're so comfortable, I might just get another pair to wear around the house!", "These \"shower shoes\" fit perfectly and are very lightweight and comfortable.

I wear a size 8 1/2 medium. I ordered a size 9/10 which fits perfectly. The packaging states that the odor will resolve by I believe the 2nd day of wearing and it did. So I was pleased with that because I am sensitive to strong odors. I am wearing these in the shower and they work great for this purpose.", "I can't stand to go barefoot. I bought these when I wore out yet another pair of flipflops. These are light, comfortable, non-slip, cute, easy to wash, and I can wear socks with them. They seem very durable, and I expect them to last longer than flipflops.", "The description says the size is a 9/10. I wear a 10 shoe and my toes and heels hang over the ends. I'm keeping them only because they'll be worn to the pool only.

I wear size 8 shoes and ordered the size 8/9. Fits perfectly. Bought second pair to keep in travel bag.", "I just needed sandals to put on my feet when I get out the shower. These sandals are very cheaply made and the bottoms were dirty when I received it. When I first put them on to wear the sandals were crushing my baby toes but after awhile I guess the sandals stretched out a bit because I stopped having that problem. Anyways in this case you get what you paid for cheap for cheap.", "This slide sandal is exactly what was needed for an elderly sister...light weight, easy to put on & can be worn with or without socks!", "1 star for the posted sizes - I wear a size 9.5M Women's US - I ordered a 9/10 size \"40\" and it felt like a size 8M - too short to work. I would have ordered next largest size however - it's not available =(. The design is very nice for pool and shower - 4 stars on design.", "Great color and fit. I use these at the gym sauna and other relaxation areas where I want to protect my feet from fungus, et al.", "This is the 3rd pair I've bought (one for around the house, one for the shower and one for outside.) They're comfy, fit good and hold up pretty good. I've not had a problem with any of them at this point.", "I wear size 9 and bought the 9/10 but was still too small/narrow. Nice quality for the price though. I would have kept them if they fit.", "Nicely made, super light weight, and great color, but definitely too small. The size chart indicated an EU 40 should fit a US 9-10, but as a 9.5, my foot hung over. My mother is an 8.5, and her feet were too long for the size 40 as well so I had to return them.

Have them, I think , in all colors!", "I love these slip on Sandler\u2019s. I only wish they would come in a size 7 and not a 6/7 or a 7/8. They are easy to wash off after being out in the yard. And great when you need something on your feet really quick.", "NOT nearly as big as the unisex shower shoes, but still a little long and wide. Then again, I appreciate the step in step out quality. These are better material than others I have bought and returned. These should last. Worth the money.", "though the smell is strong, it does dissipate as promised (but WHY does it smell so strong?) For the comfort, they are GREAT I wear them as my indoor scuffs (is that a word) like slippers, but not. I have not used them at a pool", "The slipper arrived quickly, fit exactly as expected, was comfortable, and looked great! Great shoe for gym/camp shower, poolside, beach, or everyday wear. Really like this product and recommend it to others! Thank you!", "What is a \"40\"? I ordered a 9-10 and I received what looks and feels like a small marked \"40\"!

Would buy again.", "These are my favorite sandals! I wear them in the gym shower and I also have a pair I wear around the house. They are super comfortable!

No problem. I like them. They are cheap, but they are good to carry in my swimming bag because they are light. Great to protect your feet when showering o walking around the pool.", "I really like these slides. Great for around the pool and also I like to put them on after putting cream on my feet. I feel that socks, and or slippers absorb too much of the cream. These do not and I can wash them off as needed. They run a little small, so I would suggest you go up a size. Enjoy!!", "I bought these to wear in the shower on a recent camping trip. Not crazy about the color but the really good fit and security of the sandal on my feet soon made me forget the color. I generally wear a 7.5 shoe, regular width and bought the 7/8 (38) size which was very comfortable. Very good product and worth the price.", "Not super narrow but just right for me. Fairly good quality considering cost. Great to wear around the home.", "After reading the other reviews, I ordered a size up and they were still too small. I believe they should revise their size chart to reflect the actual size the these shoes compared to other brands of shoes. Good looking but had to be returned. No stars for accurate sizing. Five stars for attractiveness.", "They are a little large but are so light that they do not slip or slide when you walk. They also do not make floppy noises when you walk.

They are used when I go outside daily to take dog out or water plants. Very comfortable and worth way more than $6 I paid.", "I bought them some time ago and liked very much so ordered a second pair. The shoes look and fit good, but the chemical odor is just horrible. The new material also feel cheap and disgusting.

I wish you would ask for reviews of all purchases as I have some input regarding other purchases", "I bought this as a pool shoe, not to be worn outside. They have little bumps that give a nice massage on the way from pool to shower, and I really like that they can be worn in the shower. I'm very satisfied. When I stated above that they give good arch support, I mean that it's satisfactory for the time I use them, certainly not for a long period of time.", "I am so happy I ordered these. I ordered them in the size I take and they fit perfectly. I can go camping and use their showers and know I won't slip and these shoes will do their job perfectly. If you don't order these for shower shoes I guarantee you won't order a better shoe...........", "I loved that they have half sizes, I bought 6.5 perfect fit very comfortable.", "These are for a gift so can't comment any further than that.

I took a chance and ordered them anyway. They are too small. However after contacting the company I will be receiving an alternate style, at no charge, and was asked to :pay it forward: by giving the too small sandals to someone who can use them. I LOVE that! I am very happy to pay it forward and pass the sandals on to a friend who will be delighted to own them. EXCELLENT customer service!

Lovely they are not.", "I think these are the most comfortable slippers I've ever had. I used to have a black woman's cammie slipper but those always made my feet sweat and they felt weird while wet.

My only complaint is that they are discontinuing the yellow color.... customer service was also very prompt and helpful in all my questions and issues.", "I love these shoes. I normally wear a size 8 shoe. Based on reviews, I ordered a size 9/40, and they fit really great. I love the cushioned, soft soles. The arch support is average for a gym shoe.

Other than that I am a size 7 and purchased a size 7-8 they fit like a 7 so it's definitely a good idea to size up...", "It appears these slides might run a little small in length; width is good. The slide is VERY comfortable. I wear them around the house as slippers and it's so much better than going bare footed. The color is beautiful (saturated sky blue). And the price is also good.", "These shoes are a great value and are perfect for using at my gym. The floor is slippery and these keep my feet from sliding. Nice design and very comfortable, I wear size 6 and these fit like they were made for me. Size 5/6 or 36. Thank you for a good product.", "I really like the construction of the slides. They run a tad small, but since I\u2019ll only be wearing them in the shower at the gym, I can make them work. Nice and light for transport, and completely waterproof, so I should be able to shake/ clap the dry enough to pack in my bag right away. Very comfy even though my heel sits right on the heel ledge.", "These fit a bit small- I ordered a 9 and I'm almost over the edges. I only use them at the gym for pool and shower. So far they do their job- I'll have to wait and see how long they last.", "I liked them so much for the pool that I bought two more, 1 to keep in my suitcase to wear in holt else and one To wear only in the house instead of shoes that have been outdoors.", "I needed comfortable, non-slip bathroom shoes and these fit the bill perfectly. Comfortable, water-proof, and fit my 6-1/2-7 feet well. I even wear them around the house sometimes (with thin socks). The small bumps on the sole do not irritate my sensitive feet and help provide stability.", "Very soft and comfortable. I usually wear size 6.5 to 7. After reading all the reviews about them running small, I ordered size 7/8. They fit well with a little extra room. My feet are medium to wide. These shoes are not narrow at all to me.", "Daughter bought these for college shower use. She loves them. She has a VERY wide foot so she orderd a size larger than her usual size.

I\u2019m disappointed", "went back to buy more colors but they had only a very bright yellow. I would have purchased a few more pair if they had other colors. update my blue pair wore out last year, I ordered a red and blue pair this year. Love these! very comfy and I get quite a few compliments on these", "I like these slide on sandals very much.....in fact I am going to order another pair but I will order up a size this time. They are comfy and great for the beach and pool.", "I wear a 7.5 US size women's shoe and bought the 7-8. I wear these in the shower at the gym. The thing I love about these is that they are super light weight and don't weigh down my gym bag. These sandals are cheap and cheerful as well!", "I ordered three pairs and two of the pairs had been worn. They are also too small. I guess that is my own fault. Not worth the postage to return them.", "They fit well. Easy to slide in and very easy to clean since they're made of rubber.", "Very comfortable & easy to pack on gym bag, friends ask me where I got them and love the color!", "These are my \"run out to the mailbox or into the yard\" shoes. I love that I can slide them on even with socks on, and I use them all the time! They are very comfortable and would be great for the pool or the beach.", "You cannot beat the price for a comfortable shower/house sandal. Only complaint is if I wear them a lot my feet seem to sweat whereas that never happens in flip flops, it may be the material. They fit good but do run on the smaller side.", "I love this shower shoe. I feel safe in shower as these shoes do not slip. I threw away my shower mat. Would be great around pool to.", "These run a bit big but they do the job fine for what I wanted them for, which was to wear as shower shoes.", "Love it second pair for Mom very secure to walk when she is doing her gardening.", "I ordered a size larger and it is a perfect fit. Comfortable, lightweight and look good enough to wear shopping.", "I really like these to use as slippers around the house. They're very comfortable and you can just wipe them to clean. I ended up purchasing a 2nd pair.", "I bought these as shower shoes and they are great for that. Super comfy. I went up a size as suggested by several other reviewers but I should have gone up 2 sizes. For showering I can live them on small side.", "Great for shower and beach shoes. I use mine as shower shoes when I travel and love that they keep my feet above water when the showers are slow draining. They are very comfortable also.", "I like so much and easy to clean even dirty bottom.", "I'm a size 6 so I ordered a size 6-7. The length was okay, but it was too tall & wide and I don't have a slender foot. I returned them. I was disappointed because I really wanted them to work out!", "I ordered these for my mom and she says these are very comfortable to wear around the house with no problems. Though, they were a size smaller than expected but, it was partially my fault. I should have ordered a size up. But, she seems to make them work so... nothing else to say.", "The color, aqua, is beautiful. I wear this type of shoe a lot and these are so comfortable. The length was perfect. I wear a size 6 shoe and these are 6/7. They are somewhat wide but seem to stay on ok. I wear them all day.", "I'm satisfied. I went by the chart of footsizes, but still shoes we're right at the mark of exact foot size . Snug as a bug. But I am definitely accustomed to a oil bit more room to spare. But thanks it is a shower slipper so it's just fine.", "I was looking for a pair of shower shoes that don't have velcro or cushion at the top. I'm very satisfied with my purchase, as these shoes are very comfortable and don't feel slippery in a matless tub. I'm a size 6 and ordered a size 6-7. I have narrow feet and the shoes fit a little loose, but not enough to bother me. I wouldn't recommend for someone who has very wide feet. These are also great if you are looking for some cheap lounging shoes!", "Exactly what I wanted. Rubber slides to wear to the pool. Did not want flip flops, did not want anything between my toes. This is perfect. Strong smell at first, but note on the slides says it goes away quickly, and it did.", "After reading the reviews I decided to buy a size up and they fit perfectly!! Also very comfortable, no complaints.", "Good fit, comfortable. I have a slight problem keeping them in a \"firm fit\" while walking on slight inclines.", "Might be comfy of I had a size that fit.I even ordered a size bigger than normal size.", "Made well and look good, but sized too small. Returned.", "So lightweight! Was looking for shower shoes for the gym and some everyday slippers to wear at a friends house when I traveled there (their place is dirty and I didn't book a hotel quick enough). Gets the job done and is so light weight, it's perfect for traveling and tossing in your gymbag.", "I purchased these for hanging out at home. They are perfect, light weight and durable.", "Spent a lifetime working outside in the yard and having very hot and sore feet. These lightweight sandals are the BEST ever and priced to get more than one pair. Now I have a pair at the front and back door and one for town!", "The shoes feel really comfortable. The shoes fit as expected and are not too wide or too narrow for my feet. I feel like I could wear these shoes all day however I bought them to use in a gym shower. I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a comfortable pair of shower shoes.", "I normally wear a 7-1/2 so I got the 7/8 size, which was way too small. Returned for the next size up and they fit, but were still sort of short. I like the shoe, but order up a size or two.", "But I have very high arches and they are extremely comfortable. My feet don't sweat as much in these and I love them. I went to buy another pair,I have a very hard time finding slides that come up high enough on my foot to keep them on when I walk,and of course they are out of stock with no date if/when they will ever have them in again.", "I love this lightweight slide ons. Keep them out of hot cars and they will retain their size", "My 8 year-old daughter wears these for swim class to/from the pool. They're perfect for that, and for the locker room shower.", "I bought these to wear in the shower when washing my hair because I have plantar fasciitis and the standing hurts my feet. These help tremendously but they run small. The size is 9-10 but they closer to size 9 but I'm a 10. Other than that comfortable.", "Does not slip if you wear them in the shower. Dries very quickly after getting wet.", "Very lightweight in a good way. Like walking on cushiony air. There is some arch support, just not a lot. I prefer not so much anyway so these are working great in and out of the shower. They had a chemical kind of fragrance to them, but not terrible and it has faded.", "I looove this sandals, I use them as my house shoes. For the price they are super comfortable and reliable the only thing that is keeping me from rating it a 5 out of 5 is that they only go up to 9/10", "Tub in apartment was refinished and management \"outlawed\" tub mats with suction cups. Other mats SUPER expensive. These are the perfect solution and I can use them at the gym shower, too!", "this work well in the gym shower. I haven't felt unstable/slippery once. they do run a little small so size up. I just were them around the shower at the gym. they are great for that.", "I ordered a size up from my normal shoe size and they just barely fit. I know the company posted they had their size issues fixed but I'm reluctant to believe that. Other than that I'm pleased with my purchase.", "Simple shower sandals.

We will see about durability but no complaints so far.", "These are very comfortable slippers! But they are small. I am size 9 but the 9-10 is still small for me.

Any smaller and they'd be too small to wear. Other than that they are perfect: comfortable and not slippery on wet surfaces and super light weight!", "Might be okay for the pool, but I would not use them as shower shoes. In the shower, your feet will slide up and through them and they will turn to the side. Just a nightmare in the shower.

I highly recommend these pool shoes.", "So comfortable! I normally wear a size 6, in these I wear a 36!", "I bought these to wear in my shower and they work great for that purpose. They are steady and make me feel safer on the water covered tiles. The work perfectly for my puspose", "This slide-on sandal works perfectly to take to the pool and into public showers. Comfort is great with nothing to hurt between your toes like flip-flops do.", "I'm a size 7.5 and I bought the 7/8 size.

Glad I did but they just do fit where I'd like them to be a tad bit bigger.", "I purchased this for a friend who wears a size 10 ( I bought the 9-10 size for her) and this was waaay too small and very narrow.

Have not yet worn them but feel they should be ok.", "The size was fine, I wear a 6 to 6.5 and ordered the 5-6.

They are definitely inexpensive looking and a little harder than I expected", "I wear an 8 usually, and ordered an 7/8, and they are way too small.

I followed the size chart and they are still way too small.", "I really like these shoes. I put on these shoes in the locker room and I no longer slip and slide my way to the pool.

They are light, comfortable and look cute on her feet. They have some arch support which is enough for her. They are easy to slip on and take off.", "They could stand to be a little roomier.

I keep ordering more because I'm afraid they might \"disappear.\"", "Cheap material but would buy again. Wear in gym shower and do what they are suppose to due", "Slides are nice and what I expected for the cost. Like many other reviewers I had a problem with the fit.

These are very comfortable and lighter that my old KEEN`s, If they hold up for most of a year I will be very happy. Even if they don`t I will probably buy another pair because my feet are very happy now.", "I bought these based on the reviews however like many said, the tongue where it's sewn causes blisters to the front of my foot,so I got creative and avoided the hinged eyelet and problem solved. So far these are holding up, I've had them since Christmas and they are pretty well broken in by now. if the stitching was reversed to the out side on the tongue, I think this would be a very comfortable boot. I had Rock ports before these and they fell apart on me 30 days in. I think so far these are good quality. I may consider buying these again if they reverse the stitching where the tongue is sewn.", "I haven't had these boots for two weeks yet and they are already squeaking when I walk. It's internal, I took the insoles out and walked with them, that didn't help, they still squeak. So far I really like these boots otherwise, but the squeaking is really loud and annoying. Update: I've had two pair of these now and both have started to squeak loudly as I walk, both pair got returned. Debating on trying a 3rd time because I really liked them otherwise, unfortunately the price has gone up now.... booooo", "This is my second pair, the first pair I bought lasted almost a year. This pair is absolute garbage in 2 months. The shoes squeak with every step on any service (driving me absolutely crazy) & the sole is already separating from the boot, therefore it's 100% non-waterproof considering at this point it's actually collecting it. The sad part is my current work site is easier than any prior, meaning less wear & tear. I either got lucky with the first pair or extremely unlucky with my second. Either way quality control seems pretty poor so I'll never be buying Carhartt boots again.", "Great for the price, so far they are durable. I work on heavy equipment out in the field, I walk in sand, mud, and some water. I did waterproof my boots before wearing for work. They are very comfortable to me, but if you spend hours out in the direct sunlight, your feet tend to get a little warm over time, if you're staying still for too long, but that's normal.", "I ordered the made in America version of this boot and had to return as the toe box was way too tight. This Chinese version fits fantastic ! I work on concrete floors for 8 to 12 hours a day these boots are great. Great ankle support and no foot fatigue. I would highly recommend these boots! I will be reordering these the next time i need boots.", "These work boots are great quality and very effective. I had a similar carhartt work boot prior to this that was great in every regard, except the stitched rubber toe basically disintegrated (and those were more expensive!). The rest of the boot seemed pretty high quality, the anti-slip grip was very effective and they were warm and waterproof even for daily use in a shipyard in Wisconsin. If these hold up as well as the last did, they\u2019ll be great boots!", "Im a general contractor. They lasted 8 months. Holes on both feet at the composite part which left my feet wet in the end and now I'm looking for new boots now. Holes on the sides as usual. Great shoes in the beginning and really liked them at first. I have yet to find shoes that last me a year or more. Wish there was a company out there that would back there products for more then a year especially when your paying over $100 for a pair of work boots. This is why I usually buy the cheap shoes because you spend more money for shoes that don't last.", "Bought these boots around 8 months ago. I am a commercial plumber, so theyve been exposed to the elements and some outdoor conditions. They definitley do not stand up to Carolinas or other well known work boots. Soles are coming off and cracking. Sucks having wet feet! Have tried contacting seller about any type of warranty with no response of course. I'll swear by carhartt clothing, but these boots are garbage!", "I will never buy these again. They are very durable, but the sole is so hard on these that every step I take my teeth chatter, Even with inserts. They aren't particularly slip resistant. The last few eyelets are not deep enough and the boots come undone easily. Unless you lace them tightly, which is super uncomfortable. Avoid. Only giving points at all because they do seem very tough.", "I haven't really worn them much, yet, but they do seem to be just what I was looking for. That said, they seem to be comfortable and more importantly the composite toe does not dig into the top of my feet. I chose the composite toe because I do not need the level of protection an aluminum or steel toe will provide and they will be lighter. Also, from past experience, metal toed boots tend to be very cold when working outside in the winter. The soles seem to be slip resistant as advertised which will be helpful because I will be wearing them in wet greasy conditions in and around kitchens doing kitchen exhaust tech services and repair work.", "I really thought these boots were going to be great. I bought a 10 and a half wide and there are still really tight, cutting off circulation on my right foot and numbing it for about 2 weeks. Return them and got an 11 wide and these for some reason seem tighter around the sides of my feet and only looser at the heel and toe. But I still have the issue of the inside lace stitching on both feet pressing against my foot and numbing it. I don't think I'll ever be buying Carhartt boots ever again.", "My husband works on his feet from sun up to sun down in warehouse conditions with one job and retail at the other so it's a lot of standing and walking, all on concrete floors. While these fit great right out of the box, he's been coming home hobbling from the pain in his heels from these boots. He's going to try some inserts to see if they'll help and I'll update the review when we have an answer. It seems rather silly that they boast having comfort technology with these, yet apparently not enough.", "Great pair of Boots..........but the Seam on the back of the Boot on the inside makes these boots unwearable with the Brace I wear! The Brace raises My Foot too high and the Seam rubs the back of my Foot an inch from the Sole of my foot! Other than that, it\u2019s a great pair of Boots! UPDATE: The Boots are a problem the Compost Right Toe, as I walk the Boot starts curling up and the Toe Guard is digging into littles Toes!", "Were comfortable for about 2 months, and then started hurting the top of my feet. Tried lacing a different way, tied laces tighter, looser, but always seemed to feel like they were cutting into my feet. Couldn\u2019t take it anymore & bought a different pair 5 months later from another website that specializes in just work boots and am happy with the new purchase. Not blaming Carhartt for the quality but am wondering if Amazon sells knock offs or slightly defective boots.", "Good boot! I like higher boots normally but gave these a shot as I respect the Carhartt brand and wanted more of my lower leg to breathe as I work in a high temperature environment and the taller boots were causing too much irritation due to sweat and friction regardless of sock type I tried. It took a day or two to break in the boot and allow my foot to adapt a bit. The stock insert supports my high arch, this is normally an issue for me. Definitely a good purchase.", "I dont usually write reviews. But after the first day wearing these boots I had too. Not often do you find a boot that doesnt kill your feet after the first day wearing them, until now. These boots stayed tied, didnt overheat and were comfortable all day long. I cant speak to the quality and durability yet as ive only had them 2 days now. But so far the best boot ive purchased yet. As a plumber who is constantly on the move I need a boot the can hold up to the abuse of the work site and will maintain comfort throghout am 8hr day. These are it", "I love these boots. 2nd pair. I work in a nuclear plant so they pass the metal detecter. Only reason this is pair #2 is because the first pair got hot particles of radiation and couldn't clear the machines to get back into the clean zone. Both are squeaky but it doesn't bother me too much, 2nd pai was squeaking within 2 weeks. I feel like SpongeBob and his squeaky boots.", "Yes, they take a good week of trudging to get them broken in but are excellent. I never even received a blister from them, and that was doing 10 miles of walking a day. Mink oil will darken them but I think they look even better that way. Looks are not as important as comfort and durability. I will buy again when these are worn.", "I just started wearing these boots and they made my second toe bleed after one day of wearing them, put my hand in the area and feels like there stitching in the area with out any sort of padding to protect your toes from moving around and bleeding. I will need to wear some thick wool socks which is a bummer because my feet are prob gonna get hot especially with summer coming up, anyhow I wont be buying Carhartt shoes anymore $$$, going back to CAT $$ or something else, they all made in china in the same factory more less.", "complete garbage. not even two months old and the sole is separating from the boot. could have got the same quality from Walmart for much less. sadly I bought a brand that used to mean quality now carhartt means foreign made overpriced junk", "This boot is the best work boot I've ever owned. They are extremely durable and very comfortable. Unlike a lot of work boots, this don't seem to lose their grip while walking on ice and snow either. If you're dong some good honest work, they'll take a scuff pretty well and still look good. I beat the snot out of these things and love them. Buy these boots. You'll love them.", "The first set of boots that I purchased through Amazon, The soles separated from the upper. However, Carhartt said they usually don't honor their warranty through Amazon but they made it right by sending me another set of boots at no charge to me. A few months later the second set they sent me did the same thing. If you feed your family and pay your bills through construction work, these are not work boots.", "I usually don't do reviews but in this case I will. I bought these boots 6 months ago 10 1/2 W and they fit perfect. I have a wide flat foot and these boots are just right not to wide or too narrow. I work on a cement MFG floor 8-12 hrs a day and could never find a shoe I could wear where my feet did not hurt at the end of the day until now. As long as Carhartt makes these boots I will keep buying them.", "Fantastic Boot. Tried them on at my local farm n fleet (Western suburbs IL) they fit great but they wanted $180. Amazon had them for $100. I stopped buying redwings 2 years ago after 9 years of wearing them. This is my second pair of Carhartt boots. Will continue to buy this product. As a mechanic, I\u2019m on my feet all day. Constantly stepping in fluid. These boots are slip resistant. I also wear a fairly large ankle brace due to an accident I was in 6 years ago. The leather is soft enough to manipulate my brace inside the boot with ease. Breathable. Dependable.", "I was hoping they would be as rugged as they looked but that was not the case. Sole detached from the leather uppers the first day out. Very disappointed.", "I\u2019ve had these boots for the better part of two years and I can\u2019t recommend them enough. I wear them every day to general contracting, building decks, sheds, remodeling bathrooms and kitchens the like and they are very comfortable. I put shoe polish on the leather to keep it looking like new and the tread you can barely tell is worn. I cant recommend them enough to anyone who works for a living.", "Impressed !!! Wasn't expecting much I purchased a month ago for work I'm on my feet all day up and down ladders and fit and finish of boots are impressive I do wear very thick socks however never been able to wear steel toe or composite boots but these are great going to buy another pair really soon so I can have a spare", "Wearing them for a week so far. They were fairly comfy from the start and even after driving for 12+ hours they are still ok, breaking them in has not been as bad as I would have expected, my wolverine boots were horrid for a good 2 weeks, these have been good from day 1. I have no problem at all wearing them and I hope they last for awhile. Happy with the purchase so far.", "wore this boots for 3-4 weeks at work, they seamed very comfortable at first. After 3 weeks my heels on both feet started aching at the end of the day. At the end of the 4th week, I could not wear them anymore and went back to my old boots with arch support. Within 2 days my heels stopped aching, Don't buy these unless you plan on buying arch supports to go in them, its not worth the pain.", "Nice rugged boot, but after a couple hours of wearing they began to cause pain at my toe ends. Thought the would \"break in\", but they're not doing it. After wearing these boots for a few hours I don't think they'll take them back for a refund. Saddens me.", "Been wearing these pretty much everyday at work and have enjoyed them. I am on my hands and knees on concrete a lot and the toe usually wears out but these are still going strong. I have had to replace the laces a few times. Just recently at about the year mark the heel has almost completely detached. I was hoping they would have lasted a little longer than a year.", "I bought these because I started working at an IT asset recovery warehouse. The work was by no means difficult or dangerous but I did need composite toed boots as it was a warehouse. In the few weeks I worked there, My boots began to look a little rough around the toes and edges of the soles. I expected some wear but I felt that these boots wore out too easily as I did not drag my feet or really do anything too strenuous. They were an OK weight, look decent and overall comfortable to wear.", "Bought them in July of 2018, return window expired in August of 2018. By December of 2018 the boots had fallen apart and I have been fighting with Amazon/Carhartt ever since to get them replaced. I do not expect to be able to come back two years later on some work boots and get them replaced but I certainly expect to get them replaced when they blow out after 5 months. Good boot otherwise but lousy process in replacing them.", "Took a couple of weeks to break in but they're comfortable enough to make a big difference in an 8hr shift. The composite toe is a great feature & its my first pair of composite toe boots but they're still durable (have had 2.5\" rigid & IMC conduit fall on them with no problem). I will mention that when I first received the boots I had to use the long handle of a pair of 440 Channel Locks to adjust the composite toe on the left boot up a bit because it was digging into the top of my foot. Ever since then haven't had any issues with them", "These are the most comfortable work boots I have owned, and I have owned a lot of them. It helps that they come in wide widths. They fit great. The composite toe makes them light and comfortable. The sole has the right amount of cushion and the tread grips well. I wear them all day, and they are always comfortable.", "As always great quality. I work in a auto shop and I'm pretty rough with these boots. But they usually last me over a year. And I only buy new ones because I choose too. Not because they fall apart. They feel amazing and even while walking on oil I'm not slipping. Great pair of boots.", "I live in Florida \ud83d\ude0e so with the weather being unpredictable I need great boots, and I put them to the test going thru boots 1 pair a yr or so I switched from Irish setter because the last pair I bought didn't last 9 months. I wasn't happy and ordered these and in just a few days now I am liking them. They are comfortable boots with a great soul to them and seem great the only downside is that my feet sweat in these. I'm a Welder/builder they handle everything well so far, so I guess Time will tell maybe it's because they're new but I've never had issues with this. But overall I'm satisfied!", "These are among the most comfortable boots I've owned. Sometimes boots require a breaking in period until they feel comfortable. These felt great the first day I wore them right out of the box. I am on my feet all day and these feel like athletic shoes. I've only had them a week, so I can't comment on durability, but they don't appear as if they will be wearing out anytime soon. The composite toe makes them lightweight which is also a plus. I highly recommend.", "These are some of the best work boots I've had in a few years. I've gone through multiple keens that are about $80 higher in price that didn't hold up to a year of work. I haven't had these long yet but they fit perfectly, added dr scholl's insoles and had 0 break in pain and can say that at the end of the day my feet do not hurt. Only dislike I have is the style of the laces but that's preference, would recommend these to anybody", "So I wear Carhartt almost everything. I was really excited about gettimg a good pair of Carhartt boots. I am a Carpenter ,my boots get a work out, but not to a point where in 3 weeks they are falling appart. Very disappointed and would really like Carhartt to send a new pair. I own a small buissness and wear all of there items. Anything I wear to.a jobsite that says carhartt is advertising. At the least another pair of boots and a gift certificate for a couple shirts or something. The toes basicly tore out after 3 weeks of working in them. $100 boots should be $100 boots.", "As a girl, I tried for years to wear womens work boots and let's be honest, they are all terrible. I finally decided to try mens and they have been life changing! I work on a farm and these boot lasted an entire year! I would recommend these boots to anyone. Usually you have to break in work boots for a week or two but these felt amazing on day one.", "Great soles, comfortable but not going to hold up for everyday use..... Amazon shouldn't advertise these as water proof because carhartt doesn't on their site.... The leather doesn't hold up as well as some cheaper brands", "boot was incredibly painful on top foot. The tongue was gathered and sewn into tight bunches that dug into the top of the feet with continued use. Returned after trying to live with them for just half a day indoors.", "Very disappointed in the quality of these boots. I\u2019ve barely had them a year, not wearing them constantly until the last month and the souls are coming off. Fairly expensive boots to fall apart I\u2019m a year.", "Just received these boots, and the quality of the boots are very nice. Boots fit great and are true to size. Has a very nice and roomy your box. Reminds me a lot of the red wing King toe boots. Comfortable out the box. Looking forward to see how they hold up in the coming weeks", "The Carhartt boot required no break ..... they are very comfortable and supportive, right out of the box. Ordered the Extremes socks with the boots and they are also very comfortable. I've tried many boots with steel toes and never found a comfortable one. The composite toe in the Carhartt is very kind to my toes. Steel toes have always put pressure in the wrong places. In my opinion, the Carhartt boot does the job and is an unbeatable value.", "This is my second pair that I\u2019ve owned. The first pair I had lasted a while. The tread was worn flat before I got rid of them with some minor holes on the toes. But I have had this pair almost 5 months before they started separating at the heal. I don\u2019t know if I got unlucky with this pair or the quality has gone down but they didn\u2019t last near as long as the last pair.", "Rugged and durable, comfortable and look great. Been wearing for three weeks. Wear a good sock or you may rub a blister. I wore a dress sock one day as all my socks were in the wash (thanks honey) and I am still paying for that. Great boot!", "I've had my first pair of boots for two years now, walking 3-5 miles a day on concrete floors, pouring concrete. They don't even need to be replaced yet. I do alternate between them and my second pair of these boots. But there is still many more miles left on my first pair. I've worn many brands of boots in my life and many don't last more then a year. I do wear mine with a cushioned insole. Even the laces have never needed replacement. That is usually the first thing to go. I would recommend these to anyone who needs a light boot for working indoors on your feet all day.", "Great shoes, very comfortable, great arch support, great for walking, climbing or standing. They feel like regular boots, safety toe almost can't be felt. One star off for laces, it always gets loose.", "I have purchased many carhartt products, including multiple pairs of boots. These boots must be defective. After 1 month of use in typical warehouse work, the leather is cracked and they are worn out. Not what I expected from carhartt. I usually get a year out of carhartt boots. try a different brand, these are not worth the money.", "I am only giving this a 3 star because I have only had these a couple weeks. Will reevaluate after a couple months. It is not fair to inform shoppers of the quality of an item only after two weeks.", "Junk. These boots are not uncomfortable, but began to fall apart almost immediately. The leather is thin and chips & tears, the sole separated from the upper in the front around the toe, and the padding at the top has come unstitched... this is all with light use - about 1 to 2 days a week of yard work and small projects. Not really a work boot in my opinion, and definitely NOT the level of quality one would expect from Carhartt, and they keep raising the price on these boots!", "My guy is a mason by trade. I\u2019ve purchased 3 pairs of these boots for him because he likes them so much! They for him as expected, do no need to worry about ordering bigger or smaller. They are waterproof and he\u2019s tested them in lots of wet surfaces! These are his FAVs.", "It fit well, but I didn\u2019t keep them. I ordered them Amazon wardrobe. I wanted to try on a few different brands and styles of work boots. Nothing wrong with them, just like Timberlands better.", "I have been buying the same work boot for my husband for the past two years and they never seem to last more than 4 months before the left heel separates. This is crazy for the amount of money this boot costs. This is the third pair in a year that the same heel blows out. I would not recommend this boot for a big and tall man like my husband", "Bought these for my husband twice in the past two years. He works in a heavy construction site with varied pavements including gravel, and they hold up wonderfully! They are comfortable and much lighter than steel toed boots. I will continue to purchase these while he\u2019s on this site.", "So far so good. Still breaking them in, but they fit perfectly and are holding up well. Occasional hard work with these, but since these are more of a casual/business wear for me, I'll switch to my Belleville steel-toed/shank boots for anything that might mess them up.", "Size 13W. Used for 11 months in construction. In mud, concrete, asphalt, on rebar/steel. Walking around uneven variable terrain. These boots are pretty comfortable, but began tearing between the sole and upper. Other direct attach boots last longer. See photos. Previous boots normally last me about two years (Wolverine, Irish Setter, Red Wing). Going back to Wolverines.", "Very nice boots, light weight.. Anyway, it is very confusing the selection chart. I bough the size 8,5 wide, and was very very tight on my toes and in the long. Amazon have a good return policy, I send back the 8,5 and ask for a 9 2E. I hope that one fix on my feet... or... I have to exchange again for a 9,5 2E. I repeat, to select the wide, it is a lite confusing.", "Killed my feet, they feel comfortable as hell but when you work long hours as i did and are overweight forget about it. It was a nightmare, needless to say i went back to my diehards.", "These boots arrived in time and were very nice. My dog chewed up my boyfriend's boots so I had to replace them quickly. These boots are terrific, they fit well, are comfortable, have nice cushioning inside and are warm. We are very happy with this purchase.", "Very little break in time. I waited over a month to write the review. I bought inserts for arch support, but I am old and need it. These look and seem to last well.", "Purchased for the composite toe (electrician work), nice look and Carhartt brand name. Very stiff on foot, bulkier and heavier weight than expected. Toe of boot curves upward more than preferred. Much too hot for this time of year, will definitely be worn only in winter. Regretted order before arrival due to being inconvenienced by delivery changing from Friday to Tuesday to Wednesday!?!", "One of the boots had a pointy irregularity on the back of the heel but I wore a Johnson and Johnson Hydro Seal All Purpose band aid for a few weeks until I was able to stretch out the heel. My wife suggested to wear those band aids, since she uses them on her heels when breaking in new heels.", "I have to write to let you know that these boots saved my toes from being severely injured by a 3000 lb scissor lift. The driver went completely up and over my foot and the only part that had any pain at all was the edge where the composite toe didn't cover. Even that part was minimal due to the composite toe taking the weight of the lift.", "Quality work boots. I bought these for my boyfriend, who works outside everyday at his job. They took a couple weeks to break in, but once they did, he loves them. They are rugged, but comfortable, and fit as expected. Would recommend.", "The fit is just right, the size is perfect. If you have the money to purchase these boots you will not be unhappy with the quality. I have worn my share of work boots, but this was my first step into composite toe boots and they are much better than I expected. Lightweight for how much protection they provide and they are not an obnoxious yellow . Highly recommend the purchase if you have to wear boots all day.", "Boots did not last 2 months. The quality of these products have gone down significantly in recent years. I used to get 1.5 years out of these boots. Received one star only because that is the least you can pick I boot should last more then 45 days", "i like these boots and have had 3 pairs, replacing them every 2 years. i found they do run a little big, so i get 1/2 size smaller than my normal size of footwear. shipping time isn't critical to me, but i should mention that these were delivered the next day after ordering.", "I put these boots through h***. Water ,snow, wet concrete. Put it this way I don't walk around anything I walk through it. If you can't do that with a pair of work boots then why buy them. Yes they are comfortable. If they are not for you Then buy a pair of insoles.", "very sturdily built, but I found them lacking in ankle support, at least for my 51 year old wobblers. Also, the thick, firm midsole will probably last a vey long time, but because of that hard outsole, they weren't quite as slip resistant as I expected, at least on my oily machine shop floors. Also not as cushioned. Returned mine.", "ORDERED THESE FOR MY SON, THEY NEEDED AN ELECTRICAL HAZARD RATING & COMPOSITE TOE, PER MY SON: THESE BOOTS ARE SUPER COMFORTABLE, COMPLETELY WATERPROOF, AND HAVE HELD UP AGAINST THE HEAVIEST WORK CONDITIONS AND DEMANDS, WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN, THANKS! :)", "These are great looking composite toe and shank boots. No problem walking through the metal detector at work. These boots are very sturdy and seem to be well built. The boot laces are a completely different story though. They are very thin and extremely undersized for this heavy duty boot, I would definitely buy these boots again!", "I work at one of those home big hardware stores with lots of orange. I purchased these boots in August and it is now May and they are starting to fall apart. I do nothing but a lot of walking I average about 5-6 miles a day in the store. The soles have not worn much on the bottom however are starting to fall off the front and side's of the boots. I have loads of carhart gear and these are the first items that have not even lasted a year.", "Quality like usual , still wearing my last pair but will toss them this winter as their falling apart after 4 years of brutal work condition s. Highly recommend \ud83d\ude0e", "Nice boot. I normally wear Chippewa Boots but these are very nice. Worth every penny ! A great work boot since I don't wear my Chippewas to work in so I don't ruin the finish but these Carhartts are tough and light and comfortable. Better than my Rockports !", "I thought the boot fit great but when I purchased it said \"Oil resistant\". I gave it a few months since purchasing to break them in but still sliding all over the floors at work in these, rendering them unusable for me since I'm already prone to falling with no oil \ud83e\udd2a", "This model has been around for over a year. I've worn through the first pair and have now received my second pair. I wear these boots almost everyday for work in industrial environments. Most situations have me on my feet, usually on concrete, with lots of walking, squatting, and climbing. I guess I recommend them if I've bought them twice!", "Truly impressed with this boot. I prefer to purchase boots after I try them at a typical store but I decided to order these online and was not let down. They have great toe room for my foot 13M and felt broken in from the very first day. I always change insoles for my feet but overall construction, look, feel and wear are one of the better boots I have owned.", "Everything is solid on this shoes except the tongues. Both were poorly stitched on both shoes creating a stiff fold on both sides of both shoes. This resulted in 2 contact points on the front of the boney part of the ankle becoming sore after a short wearing - these are work boots so I cut these sections out with a razor blade and they fit great now.", "I really like these. I need more arch support for my poor old feet so I like that the inserts are removable for the new ones to fit.", "I\u2019m shocked at what I spent on there and how worn they are in just a month. I am always buying good boots for hubby to help his back, these were supportive for about 3 days. I wish I could return these and get boots worth the money!", "Worn ~50hrs per week for 1 year 8 months in automotive shop, heat and snow, with minimal wear down. Just started getting a hole in the top where the toe crease is, they've been good for waterproof, but that causes so much foot sweat.", "These are my husband's first Carhartt boots. He asked ME to get him new boots. Like, by myself. I was worried, but apparently I nailed it! ;) ;)", "My son says these are the most comfortable boot he has worn. Just pull out of the box, doesn't need any breaking in. He loves these boots.", "These boots are absolutely great minus the generic insoles. They're Lightweight and able to withstand a fair share of punishment. However, it is time for a replacement pair after a little over a year, due to them no longer being able to keep out water. They were differently worth it and there is no wonder as to why Carhartt is a trusted brand among consumers.", "I'm still breaking them in, but so far I'm happy with the boot. I didn't care for the thin laces so I replaced them with leather laces.", "Pretty great boot. Put them to work the moment I got them. Didn\u2019t get one blister. Each day become more comfortable. Solid purchase. Would recommend", "That I got these in May and they already feel apart. I bought them for my job in June and by August they started coming apart. My CAT boots were better quality and lasted a year. I figured because of the brand they would be as good or even better. Would not recommend them.", "I have owned all types of work boots over the years and these are by far the most comfortable boots I have ever owned..they are lightweight but solid and fit perfectly....they feel more comfortable than sneakers...the best..", "Traction was bad with wet boots on tile or wood floors. Bought insoles super good boot on concrete and in the mid.", "Perfect to discipline unruly children on Christmas vacation from a distance. Also used them on an neighbor who let his dogs outside when its freezing. They worked wonders with him too. Hold on, I have to go unchain him (in his new wheelchair) from the fence post outside...", "I ordered size 8 and received size 8W. It fits me loose butit will be fine in winter when I wear heavy socks.", "Bought these gems for my husband and he absolutely loves them.... He works in construction delivering drywall and said they are one of the best boots he's worn and they have held up so much longer than alot of the other boots he's owned.", "It's not a bad boot, my main problem with them was the tung of the boot constantly fell down to the inner side of my foot and ankle. Laces did not stay very tight which I think was part of the problem. Wore them for about 4 month and decided I was sick of them. Would not buy them again. I appreciate the fact that they come in 15 inch so thanks for that", "Great boots. True to fit with lots of toe room..very short break in time comfortable flexable lightweight compared to a full accual steal toe. I would for sure buy again. I put on KGs boot guard on the toe as seen in the pic.", "Tall, great, not as wide as I thought. Laces are narrow and weak. Might need to replace them. Composite toe feels like steel, weight, strength and slight comfortability, but it's wide and tall enough to be ok.", "The boot looked great and fit fine, but there was something in the right boot that hurt my ankle. Could not wear them so returned them", "I got these for my husband for work. i just got them delivered, i open the box and take a boot out to check em out and they seem very heavy weight. Other then that they seem really nice besides being so heavy for a boot. I hope he likes them!", "Went back and forth about what safety toe boots to get. After talking to a buddy that had a similar pair I went with these. Crazy comfortable, no break in time and extremely lite. Now we play the how long will they last game.", "Excellent boots with a solid feel. Materials are quality and well put together. Didn't take long to break them in. Took a star off for how rigid the heel area is. There is zero flex on the back of the boot. Caused some really unfortunate rubbing on the back of my foot until they were broken in.", "In case you havent been on this planet Carhartt Is The Best. And to get at a reduced price is the cherry on top.", "Very comfortable work boot out of the box but after maybe a day or two to break them in they were even better. Nice looking dark leather, light weight, and well made. I did replace the laces with a better set. A little water resistant spray and they are perfect.", "I bought these from Fred Meyers and they lasted me over a year. These ones for some reason fell apart really fast after about two months.", "The toe box and width are perfect. I wear these every day to work and they are very comfortable.

Will be ordering another pair since the tread has worn out .", "Well made boots for harsh work environments. I work on a freight dock for a living, so they get put through the test every day. So far they have saved my feet countless times. The leather is very good quality as well as scratch resistant. Good boots for the price.", "They seem to be holding up well for the most part. the laces are showing some wear and starting to fray. Everyone will hear you coming when walking on tile floors in these boots. They squeak loudly. I assume its the rubber bottom of the shoe.", "Most Carhartt stuff is fantastic. These just didn't fit my feet that well. If I wore thick socks my heel still slopped around. I usually wear normal thickness socks", "Comfortable to stand in all day, fit perfectly, and fairly lightweight compared to a steel toed boot. They're also fairly water-resistant in my experience. Great boots, would recommend for anyone that does a lot of standing and cares about their toes not breaking. The composite toe is obviously not as strong as a steel toe, but you should've known that before considering a composite boot.", "Great boots for the price. Very comfortable and flexible. I walk miles a day at work in these with no feet aches. They are rather light in weight and offer good protection. Good deal.", "I bought these for my husband and he loves them. He says they're the most comfortable shoes he owns, and they worked perfectly keeping his feet protected and dry at work. They're durable and they look fantastic", "Perfect, same product and fit as before. Just as described. I have a hard time finding boots, and Carhartt wide boots fit me fine. Thanks", "Bought these for my son and he absolutely loves these boots. He says they're comfortable and easy to break-in. He didn't have any issues with discomfort at all.", "The only problem I have with these boots is that one of the loops for the shoelaces digs into my ankle, I have a scar on the inside of my ankle and the backing for the loop is right at that spot, its hurts so bad I can't wear the boots. The boot on my other foot fit perfectly and was really comfortable, if I didn't have the scar, the boots would have been perfect.", "This is my third consecutive pair of these boots. I usually get around 12-16 months of solid use out of a pair of these boots. Comfortable sole, wide the box, good leather. Good insoles too. I use mine in a welding shop and coat the toes.", "Bought these for my husband as he works outside with heavy machinery. He loves them.", "If you tie them snug they hurt your ankles... they are ok for the price ... width is nice ... maybe they be good after break in stage", "Deliver everyday. I got a great deal on Amazon and these boots are very good. They are not 100 percent waterproof but the do a great jod of resisting it. I wear mine everyday they are alot lighter and more comfortable than steel toes. Amazon once again provided the cheapest deal and fastest delivery out there", "These boots didn't last a year. the sole is coming off and the waterproofing didn't last 6months. Carhartt quality is going down the tubes.", "Nice boot... would have kept it but too big. Our fault. We ordered a 1/2 size bigger. Most boots tend to run too small when you put your big thick bulky heavy socks on. Not this boot!! Shipped it back and found another boot here in town.", "pops gets these.. he's tried lots of boots over the years. he gets it in with the boots and they held together and get daily abuse from all sorts of elements and fluids you name it. comfy and he likes them.", "Took these backpacking and beat them to hell and back and they did great. They dry fast and the insoles that come are fairly decent thou I added my own extra padding which was good but not needed. Went about 2 miles up creek to reach our last spot on our trip and these were a game changer to the old boots I had been using.", "I wear a 12 wide, they fit like I expected.....I like my foot to JUST fit front to rear, not much space. If you like a little fore and aft room, they may be a little small. Width is roomy but not floppy. The composite toe is not even noticeable to my feet.", "Fast delivery. Quality - Looks & Feels well made! A gift. Happy with purchase.", "Worn for only a few days so far but fit is very good. A nice pair of boots.", "Fit pretty nice, comfy been wearing them all day. Stiff but still need that brake in period. So I\u2019m sure once they brake in they won\u2019t be as stiff. Fit really well.", "As the picture shows the front of the toe started to come apart. I bought in November put them on the shelf till 1 month ago. I mostly work in the office my other boot was 1 year old because I get a boot allowance every year. The boot is very comfortable and fit right away but I thought I was buying a higher end boot!", "A great pair of boots however after wearing them daily for a few months the inside back of the heel liner/support is starting to pull out with my foot when being removed. Occupation Landscaping and a lot of walking.", "First of all, the curb appeal of these boots is very attractive. As for comfort, I have a slightly narrower foot than a regular size 12 D and I have had cases of plantar fasciitis so I do use the inserts and it makes these boots extremely comfortable for the kind of boot that it is. The price was right and I would highly recommend these to anyone.", "I bought them as a gift for my partner who uses them daily loading airplanes, and he says he loves them and that they\u2019re very comfortable and durable.", "They feel a bit heavy ie-composite toe- but are actually very comfortable installing cabinets all day", "Order a half size up.

No breakin required and they fit perfect with room for all of my toes inside the composite protective area. Love them so I keep coming back!", "Very comfortable boots. I used to have similar ones from Carhartt that go up higher on the ankle and with the steel toe, but I decided to try these this time. They work great for my work around the yard, plus they are more comfortable and easier to put on and take off than the previous ones I had (which were also great boots and lasted a long time).", "Rugged, durable work boots, they fit pretty well out of the box. I dislike ordering shoes without trying them on first. But these fit pretty good, slightly wider than I would like which makes them a smidgen too big overall. Good quality work socks will fix this issue. Overall happy with this purchase, thank you Carhartt for another high quality work product, I love your stuff made for workin people like me!", "Good boot. Keeps my feet warm and dry. Solid on ladders. Laces kinda blow and the toe is wearing out much to soon .may or may not buy again.", "My husband loves these boots for work. Love how they are a littler darker. He says they fit great.", "My husband loves them. He is a contractor and says they are super comfortable. Probably the most comfortable work boots he has ever bought. they were a little bit larger than some of the other boots he has had of the same size but he started wearing wool socks with them and has had no problem with the fit after that.", "My husband felt like these boots were comfortable from the beginning.", "This is my second pair, I walk and am on my feet most of the day, crawl around inside and on top of big tanks a lot, and never had problems with them. They're comfortable, and the first pair lasted a year and a half before I thought I should replace them.", "Not as comfortable as described even with $40 inserts in place. I'm in my boots sometimes 12-16 hours a day so I will be looking for something different next time.", "These boots saved my life . As an industrial electrician I am constantly working on high voltage applications. Lock out tag out got cut off my disconnect and energized while I was working on it. I trust carhartt with my life and as good as these look, they feel like clouds as well.", "My husband has only wore the boots for almost a week and part of the side came apart. For now doing a 3 star because of the material coming apart.", "I\u2019ve worn steel toes for years and tried to wear for about a month and feet were constantly in pain. Tongue has knots on the sides that dig into leg, shoe strings are inflexible, bend between the shoe and the upper never would break in. Will never buy Carharrt boots again.", "Love the boots, except for the fact that I must stop to re-lace and tie them every 30 minutes. The top two eyes are hooks, and they are too shallow to keep the laces in. Once one pops off the others do and the boot is no longer secure.", "Son asked for same pair this Christmas. Lasted all year of him working.", "Garbage boot. Had to return. And still not yet refunded.", "These boots are Very Uncomfortable the toe weights alot and is bulky looking and the ankle area inside the boots rubs bad and boot has no flex at all. Definitely the worst boot I have ever had and all the Good reviews is the reason I bought these.", "I've been using these boots for 60 days an industrial electrician and have really enjoyed them. I swapped out the insoles a couple of days in to better support my higher weight (270lbs). A very flexible, but rugged boot as the title suggests.", "If you are a roofer and deal with hot roofs don't by there junk mine lasted 2 months", "Looked nice, seemed pretty light but I was unable to get the boot tight enough to provide any ankle support or even keep debris out.

It fits as it should, looks good, and it has all the safety requirements covered. I like that it has a composite toe vs the traditional steel one...my toes won't freeze on the colder days. All in all a good buy.", "I wore these for a few hours the day I got them. I wore them to work the next day. I have other inserts added to the ones inside. They were comfortable throughout the day. Great boots for the price!", "Bought these for my daughter in law. She loves them and couldn't be happier!", "Boots are well made as expected from Carhartt. The laces are a bit stiff for the first several weeks. Only negative is that they put a stiched seam just above the heel on inside of the boot that really chafes the back of you foot. Wear boot socks for sure and you shouldn't have a problem. Well made boot other than this one issue.", "My husband loves these, lighter than his last pair. We spent hours searching, reading reviews. So happy we purchased these. Even his brother bought a pair. Love the ladder grip.", "Ordered for my Dad in construction.

They look so sharp that I can wear them out to dinner.", "Very nice boots. Got them as a gift for my father-in-law and he loves them.", "As others have mention, they aren\u2019t waterproof. That\u2019s a minus. They have a lot of room, which is good for winter, but wearing normal socks I feel like I\u2019m swimming in them. They look great out of the box. One day after wearing them in the shop- not so much. The finish shows scuffs very clearly. So, I\u2019m happy, but not overjoyed.", "Live these boots.

Love these boots!", "I will start off by saying these are great work boots. I love them. They are comfortable and are great for my kind of work (standing long periods, climbing up anf down ladders, etc.). The issue that I have with these boots or at least my pair is that after a few weeks of wearing them, a small pebble sized bulge appeared in the seam behind the heel in the left shoe. It is extremely uncomfortable and causes my foot to blister. Its very frustrating because its such a small thing and without ripping the shoes up, it can't be fixed. Without this issue these shoes are great, but I can't rate them any higher because of this.", "Nice boot, but the shoe laces are a little chintzy.", "So far these boots are great.

The composite toe edge always caused severe pain and wounds to the side of my big toe. Even though I do not have a wide foot, the all-over wider boot in this style is not a problem. These do not cause pain, my wound is healing. I've also started wearing Carhartt socks that are made for composite toe boots - boot length, not crew length.

I am a woman, but my coworkers suggested that purchasing male boots and I am so glad they did! The look is great, they are SUPER comfortable, and do the job.

With the (thin) fleece lining they are perfect for cool to cold winter days with no snow, when you are running errands and shopping and don't need a winter boot. Can be worn comfortably indoors too. They do run large, I had to exchange for a half size smaller. The barn red is a nice deep berry, very versatile. I may order in another color.", "Beautiful shoes. Love the red leather! I got the Womens 10, my normal size. They appear to fit well, until I walk in them. Big problem is that the heel slips off with every step. I read about this problem in other reviews but decided to order them anyway. All of my shoes, boots, winter boots and even steel toe boots are Keen's, because historically they had what I needed: wide/tall toe box, narrow supportive heel, and really good arch support. This has been harder to find in recent years. I'll be sad to return these shoes.", "Really like the color of this shoe - a welcome change from black or gray. The shoe fits well - however as with other Keen shoes I have purchased, the heel area is a little wide resulting in a loose fit. Remedied this with a heavier sock/or 2 light layered socks. Even with heavier socks, the shoe still fits comfortably. Haven't tried them out in winter weather yet. My only concern is that they do not \"squeak\" . Had that issue with another pair of Keens (different style) - so hoping that this pairdoesn't develop that annoying little noise - especially since these are an expensive pair of shoes! Time will tell.", "The Kaci Winter WP shoes are just what I was looking for. I bought my first pair of Keens last summer and my feet never felt better.

And actually look good in a large size.", "I ordered these shoes after reading positive reviews. I wear a size 6-1/2 and ordered a 6-1/2 which fit perfectly. They arrived neatly boxed, wrapped in tissue and tissue inserts to maintain the shape. At first sight they reminded me of Dutch shoes. I wanted an outdoor shoe for the yard, but I\u2019ve been wearing them indoors and on walks as well. They are very comfortable, sturdy and well made.

I am a big Keen fan, and currently own 11 pair (walking shoes, hiking boots, sandals). I need good walking shoes and my feet appreciate a wide toe box -- Keen never fails me on my requirements. One or another pair of my Keens are my \"go to\" shoes nearly 100% of the time. I was in the market for a slip on walking shoe and noticed these. I love them so much I may order a second pair of them to keep in reserve. BTW, the fit is completely as expected. I always order the same size and have never been disappointed by the fit.", "I have bought at least 10 pairs of Keen footwear - sandals, shoes, boots, clogs... I just love the way they fit. I normally wear a size 10, and find that I need to order a size 41 (Keen's 10.5) to achieve the proper fit. These shoes are typical of Keen - high quality, comfortable, rugged yet attractive. There is ample room in the toe box. I have a medium width foot with a somewhat narrow heel, so I do slip a bit in these, but they're great with my warm socks. Another win from Keen.", "Purchased these for my mom for Christmas because I have a pair, and I love them! Keep your feet nice & warm without getting too hot. I haven't spent hours outside in these, but what I use them for my feet stay warm. Plenty of toe room for those with wider feet. Very good soles to help with traction in the snow/ice. Highly recommend! The price on Amazon is cheaper than what I purchased my shoes for from a sporting good retailer.", "I had tried these on in a store and knew to order a half size smaller. Even then, they are roomy. Comfortable right out of the box, whether I am on my feet in the kitchen or walking or light hiking. Good for rainy days and I anticipate they'll be fine in the Maine snow as well. Good tread, water resistant, roomy enough for thick socks. Good arch support.", "They are nice looking casual shoes and the fit was true to size. However, the exaggerated arch support hurt my feet and the top of the shoe where your foot goes in was too tight and uncomfortable, perhaps because I have a high instep. I wanted to keep the shoes, but they are too uncomfortable so I am returning them.", "Comfortable, warm shoe with good support. Wide toe box but prob a slightly narrower heel than some Keene shoes. its still a bit wide for me but fits ok. But if you love the way Keene hiking boots fit (wide all over), these may not feel the same. I can't wear the boots but love these shoes!", "Love these! I now have 2 pairs....one for home and cabin. They are a little tight when u first put them on around the ankle. Don't despair. They loosen up and get easier to put on. They keep my feet warm, supported, don't slip off, easy to walk in.

I do not like my toes to be squished and love that Keen's have more room. I am so glad to find these. They were exactly as expected and I am very pleased.", "These shoes are as comfortable as all the reviews have stated. I bought them for a cold, rainy trip to Ireland. Time got away from me and I didn\u2019t get a chance to break them in before going. I have a bad back and arthritis so I am very shoe sensitive. I was worried because of all the walking we would do. That was a wasted worry. They were not only comfortable right out of the box but they kept my feet warm & dry the entire trip. Two thumbs up from this lady!", "Keen makes great shoes and this one is a good one. Has a wide toe box and it took me awhile to get used to it, esp. since I have a big foot! Very well made and will probably last and hold up for many years. A little clunky, but if I had a smaller foot, it would probably not seem that way. Would give it 41/2 stars.", "I LOVE THESE SHOES ESPECIALLY THIS STYLE, EXCEPT THEY ARE RUNNING WAY LARGER THEN THEY NORMALLY DO. I WEAR KEEN ON A REGULAR BASES AND KNOW MY SIZING.", "Almost all of the reviews said they run big, but I found just the opposite. I got my usual shoe size, and they are very tight with my wool socks. I love the style, and I think they would be comfortable, if they weren't so tight. If I can wear these without socks or with thin socks, I may also get the same shoe in a larger size to wear with wool socks.", "They feel a little stiff when putting them on for the first time, and there isn't much padding for shock absorbing, They will probably stretch in time. Although the fit is adequate, there is very little in the way of arch support. I do like the waterproof features. I also like that they have a lug style sole, makes for better traction on slippery surfaces.", "I believe these to be a great winter shoes (Kaci winter). Keens have that great boxy toe for extra room (socks). They have traction for those icy days, and lined for extra warmth. I think I\u2019m going to like these shoes. I wear a size 6 shoe, that is what I bought. They fit great.", "Keens always fit my foot perfectly. These are comfortable right out of the box!

Ordered my usual Keen size. FIt is perfect with thick socks. Nice and warm for the winter. Would be too loose with thin socks. Arch is only so-so, but still okay. Walked 2 miles on city streets without any problem!", "The Keen shoes are adorable and very comfortable. I bought them in red and love the color. My feet stay warm in them and my toes have wiggle room. The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are not quite comfortable and supportive enough for me to wear for serious walking (walking, not hiking). They are fine for normal walking and for the workday, but I still want to change into sneakers for a long walk. Also, I said \"Fit as expected\" but they are on the roomy side. That is probably why I don't find them supportive enough to wear on long walks. But for kicking around, normal walking, etc, they're great.", "I was looking forward to these for the support I have come to love in Keen . This shoe however even with winter wool socks was slipping off because it was too wide. I am trying another size and style and am praying it works.", "These are great shoes. Enough room in toe area to not hurt my arthritis. Waterproofing is amazing. I was standing in puddles, that didn't go over top of the shoe, and my feet were warm and dry! That was a good thing because I had to wear them on several cold rainy days and they did the job very well.", "I was looking for a brown pair of slip on shoes that would look nice with jeans for a decent price and these shoes are exactly what I was looking for. I normally wear a size 8 in most shoes and these shoes were a tad bit loose but overly big. I have narrow feet and the width of the toes were a little wider than I was expecting though. The color is exactly as I have pictured. (Dark chocolate brown). Happy with my purchase so far.", "I needed these to fit a Superfeet rigid insert and to match the height of my orthopedic boot. I chose Keen since my Keen hiking boots are so comfortable and I was hoping these would too. These fit perfect. Can\u2019t wait to wear the left shoe so my shoes will match!", "Great arch support and perfect for winter. Fit perfectly. Looks great. There is just no cushioning. When you struggle with plantar fasciitis your need support and cushioning. Sadly these only meet one of those requirements.", "I kerp buying this shoe bc it's really comfortable and I love the red, in spite of size weirdness. Keens feel great in me, so I've been committed. First bought 8.5, generally my size, too big, but I tried to make them work with a thicker sock; they stretched to WAY too big. Now I'm in an 8 which is still a bit roomy, but I'm OK with it. Definitely a winter shoe based on fuzzy lining and need for heavy socks.", "I tried this shoe for winder wearing. I love Keen shoes but this one was tight on the top. If you have a very high instep (arch), as I do, this shoe just didn't work. It was also very hard for me to get on. Sadly I returned it.", "My feet run between 7.5 / 8 - by comparison, I'm a Merrell 8 - and for these I feel I should have ordered a 7.5. Comfortable though, and they appear to have good tread. Very excited to have these for the winter.", "I own several pairs of Keen shoes and love them. However, these are significantly larger than my other Keens. I wish I had heeded the advice of other reviewers and bought a half size down from my regular size, but alas. The half size down is no longer available, so I'm returning these and am out of luck. :( I loved the shoes otherwise, but am giving just 2 stars because Keen needs to do a better job with sizing to avoid having this happen to customers.", "- very comfortable - I will be getting more Keens - I have foot problems and bought Mephisto shoes that went to the donation bin because they were uncomfortable- pleased !", "I love Keen shoes but this shoe runs very large so I would buy a half size smaller. Unfortunately the ankle also felt large so my ankle didn't feel very secure or supportive...I even tried putting inserts and it still felt big ...ended up giving them to friend with a bigger foot.", "I don't have much to say, since I already own a pair of these same shoes in a different color, but they are great! Warm and comfortable, I get compliments on my light brown ones all of the time, so I am sure the same will be true of these.", "Very comfy, true to size for me the toe area is supposed to be roomy and there nice and comfy snug not big snug. Flexible too!!!", "I do a lot of walking in my job and these shoes are terrific. They have a lot of room in the toe area which keeps my foot from cramping up by the end of the day. I just love them!", "These are the best shoes I've come across in a long time. Very comfortable. Ordered 6 1/2, my usual shoe size, and they are perfect! Love them.", "Love them!! Support could be a little better, but that's not the type of shoe they are. Warm. not slippery. Stylish.", "I've been shopping Amazon for years, and this is my first review. Winters in Chicago are no fun, and I've been searching for something in between my Birks and Uggs to wear that goes well with jeans, and can hold up to the elements as well. Decided to give these a try & LOVE them! Very well made with great traction. The top of the shoe was the slightest bit narrow when I first tried them on, but they felt extremely comfortable by the second wear. Highly recommend these!", "This shoe was all that I had hoped for! Looked great with jeans and I am sure I could have hiked in them as well. I have flat feet and plantar fasciitis and this shoe fit like a glove EXCEPT for that darn heel. It slipped something awful, so much so I couldn't overlook it and I couldn't bare the thought of wool socks with these shoes. If only.....", "I usually order wide. These fit well and are quite comfortable. I do not wear them with socks as they would then be a bit snug.", "They are a bit tight to put on, but once on, they fit as expected. I put in orthotics and they still fit fine. These do not make my feet hot. They are great casual shoes.", "Fits as expected for size. For support, not so much. Anatomical foot bed is quite flat, so if you\u2019re looking for that old KEEN feel, this is not the shoe for that. I have several older pairs of KEENS and they all feel better for support.", "My feet are hard to keep happy and I can wear these around my house almost all day, or out on shopping and errands. Only disappointment was that they weren't comfortable for a brisk walk in town. So, not walking shoes.", "Great fit, comfy and warm. I wear them with heavy socks. The heel slips a bit, but to be expected with a slip on shoe. I LOVE these shoes. I have a Morton's Neuroma and find that Keens are the only shoe I can wear comfortably. Kudos to Keens.", "This is my second pair of these Keen shoes and they've gotten me through the entire winter! I wear them daily walking, shopping etc. They are comfortable and look nice too. I highly recommend these.", "I was hoping to wear these on a trip to Dublin in winter--lots of walking, lots of rain. Sadly, they were too short, from heel to toe, and too wide across the middle of the foot. Fairly plain but cute enough for travel, if they had fit.", "Got these for my wife, who is not allowed to bend for six months while recovering from back surgery. She slipped them and pronounced them perfect, and they are now her go-to shoe.", "I love these shoes. They have a wide toe bed which I need for my bunions! Very comfortable and great looking too!", "I followed others reviews and ordered a half size smaller. I usually wear an 8.5 and ordered an 8. I have not tried them with socks yet, just barefoot and they fit like slippers. love the color.", "Around your angle is tight and top of foot by angle is tight. Rest is comfortable. I debated on sending back or hoping they would loosen up. I did the later.", "These are great shoes, for me. They fit like a glove! I like the style and they will be great for winter I suspect. I have wide feat and a high arch which are accommodated.", "These fit well but I not pleased with the quality of the leather. This does not look like it\u2019s picture and is not a smooth leather like the last Keens snow shoes I had. It looks like (faux) suede to me but I need this type of footwear now so I will keep them.", "These shoes are extremely comfortable like my other Keens. A bit more rugged for winter use (tread) but probably not for deep snow or rain puddles. As a slip-on fan, they are slightly challenging to get my feet into, but they\u2019re so comfortable once they\u2019re in!", "Nice \"winter\" shoes. Good tread so I don't slip on snow/ice. Got these to replace regular sneakers in the colder temps. I can also wear them for casual dining, since they're a bit more \"dressy\" than sneakers.", "I have a lot of foot problems and pain. Usually takes a long time to break shoes in but these are wonderful. I walked three miles in them the first time I wore them. I love them.", "Omg I ordered another par that I couldn\u2019t get on so I returned them. Omg this pair perfect on the first try", "The shoe I received does not look like this at all. My shoe has pretty much an open back end and it is not lined with the fleece lining as shown in the picture. Certainly did not receive anything close to this picture. ????", "I like them, however, even though I ordered a size smaller than my last Keens, they are still a bit loose.", "I must admit. It is a fine looking shoe. Veryet Well constructed. Unfortunately I had to return but I would consider buying them again a 1/2 size smaller!", "I LOVE these shoes! So comfortable right out of the box. This is my second pair-last pair wasn\u2019t waterproof-so glad these are. I live off the beaten path and wear these all winter-highly recommend!", "Love Keen shoes!!!!! These run just a little large, but I just wear my thicker socks! The color is great and they are so comfortable!", "I love these shoes. They are roomy for wearing wool socks and cold proof for long walks to work. I am okay with the way they have stretched a little with 1 month of wear. They are designed large toe box which is comfortable for my foot.", "a great shoe for winter wear. they are warm and good on snowy or icy surfaces. I was looking for a winter shoe to wear instead of boots since I only really need boots in deeper snow. these are perfect, just what i was looking for!", "I have looked for these Keens for 2 years to replace the ones I had been wearing for 8 years. These exceed my expectations. I am very particular about the shoes I wear and these are simply amazing. I am so happy thank you seller!", "The heal sometimes folds down when I put them on. Otherwise they fit and feel great.", "This shoe was comfortable from the beginning. A perfect fit!", "I love these shoes. They fit perfectly and did not need to be broken in. Absolutely waterproof. While they don't look \"delicate,\" they aren't clunky. Great travel shoes.", "Based on my experience with Keen, this shoe met all my expectations, I love them!", "Great winter shoes. Warm, waterproof and GREAT traction. What more could you ask for?", "My wife loves these. Perfect for when you have to be on your feet for extended periods", "I ordered these to replace my loved but well worn Keen Baileys which are no longer available. I am more than pleased with this style and the immediate comfort. Perfect for my fit and needs.", "I have not worn these shoes yet because it is still too warm outside. They fit pretty well and I am looking forward to dry, warm feet this winter.", "These shoes were are comfortable immediately, no \"break in period\" required. Very comfortable and stylish!", "too big, sending them back. Other wise a great slip on.", "I love Keen shoes. They are so consistent. They are very well built. Would recommend highly.", "I like KEEN shoes and am accustomed to the look, but this one was a little too clunky for me. I sent them back.", "I really fell in love with this shoe! I like the extra warm lining in the heal area. Very cozy and warm shoe.", "Keens always fit me the same, and I appreciate that predictability and quality. Nice looking shoes!", "Too narrow of an opening could not even get my foot into the shoe", "Fits perfect - ordered 1/2 size larger to accommodate boot socks. Keeps feet warm and dry!", "I wish I would have bought these sooner. Threw my other shoes in the trash.", "I love the shoes. I only ordered one pair but I got two pair that\u2019s why I had to send a pair back. Thank you.", "Love these shoes. I went a half size down as suggested, & they fit perfectly!

My feet stay nice and powder fresh all day.", "As always, Keen doesn't disappoint. These are well made, sturdy shoes - perfect for winter.", "Sized down half a size for a perfect fit!

So comfortable I can wear them without any foot pain without needing to break them in... best shoe ever!!", "I am glad that I got my shoes a1/2 size bigger.They run a little small. No arch support,but love them.", "Love this shoe except that it fits better with thick socks. This is my size but larger than I expected.", "warm and comfortable right out of the box! can't wear socks that are too thick, as it makes it a bit difficult to pull shoe on, but i think that this will be a great winter shoe.", "I read the reviews that said these shoes fit somewhat large. I am normally a 6, but got the 5.5. I LOVE these shoes. They are super comfy and look great. Highly recommend", "Didn\u2019t like the fact that the back of shoe has been a disappointment", "These shoes seem to be pretty good, they are wide enough so very comfortable,", "Love the shoe it's comfortable all day. Weather proof for our rain and mud. Perfect red color I'm wearing them with everything.", "Most comfortable shoes I've worn in long time. Nice toe box size doesn't pinch toes and insole fits my feet very well.", "The shoes were to big and not warm as reviewed.", "I really like these shoes, they're very comfortable and warm. The only problem was that they run large, so I exchanged them for a half size smaller.", "I have a wide foot. These fit well. Good color and style.", "Nice color and very comfortable. They were a little large. I ordered a women's 10.", "Love these shoes !!! this is my 5 th pair , I think !! I wear them all year !", "Seams are loose and although it's supposed to be a scuffed style on the arch it looks as if they've been worn due to them piling on the inside.", "ordered half a size down and they fit perfectly. love them!", "Usually Keens are spot on. I'm always an 8 in every Keen (and most shoes) I've worn for years but these were really sloppy. Had to return them.", "Love these shoes. I have narrow ankles and they hug perfectly. First pair of shoes I didn't have the break in!", "I did not like the color and they were a little too short. So I ordered the next size up and in the Oatmeal color and I love them.

Perfect \"mudders\" or snow boots; but don't make her feet to warm to wear inside.", "I purchased these shoes because of the way they were made, they kept my feet warm and I'm able to walk comfortably. thanks", "Love these shoes...warm, snug and waterproof so far this New England winter!", "Fit is true to size.

Overall, this long time Keen shoe wearer is very happy with this Amazon experience.", "love my keen shoes! have several different pairs. very comfey", "These shoes are very comfortable.

I have plantar fasciitis and I was able to wear these shoes all day long without any pain.", "Like these shoes. They keep my feet nice and warm!", "I have always been a fan of Keen shoes and these did not disappoint.", "These shoes are designed to fit real feet, meaning roomy enough in the toe!

I'm so lucky I browsed through some reviews before purchasing these shoes. Many people suggested to size down on these, so I ordered a 7, even though I'm a size 8 in every other shoe. The size 7 fit perfectly. They are soft, lightweight, comfortable and they look very nice. The material is very breathable, and the white rubber is easy to clean (especially with some peroxide). I'm definitely buying a second pair of these shoes.", "These shoes are VERY plush, particularly in the ankle and in the forefoot. I use them at the gym for \"boot camp\" and plyometric exercise classes. They would also be great for casual shoes if you like a sporty aesthetic and plan to be on your feet a while. The reason they lost a star for me is because they are marketed as running shoes and they are DEFINITELY NOT for running... They are heavier and foam-ier than I like for running and they get too hot and uncomfortable if you do any more than a 10 minute warm up run.", "The best sneakers I\u2019ve worn in over a decade. I\u2019ve paid $150 and more for good quality sneakers and I did not expect a sneaker at this price point to be so amazing.

Enough room for my forefoot without feeling immense pressure like the shoe is too tight (like in Nike sneakers). My heel is held in place and doesn\u2019t slide around and get blisters. The foot bed has a luscious cushiony feel while still supporting my higher arch.", "Nice shoe, but as you can see from my pictures it runs very large. My toes are a good inch or two from the edge of the shoe. I am a size 10 and purchased a 10, it fits like an 11. Would definitely order a size down.", "These shoes are very comfortable! I work 12 hour shifts and these shoes have been great. They are wider than Nike air max shoes which for me made all the difference.

I bought them about 2 years ago and I love them so I wanted to buy the most similar shoe Adidas had on offer now, and this was it. I ordered the exact same size shoe and the holding the soles together this one is clearly a 1/2 size shorter than the older model of the nearly identical shoes.

I\u2019ve worn clogs for years as a nurse, but had to switch to tennis shoes after having a plantar fasciotomy this summer. The shoe has just the right amount of arch support, that is very cushioning with each step. The color and design is really pretty as well.

If you\u2019re someone who is on your feet for long hours then these shoes are perfect for you.", "These shoes are very comfortable, the fit was great, and as someone who needs good arch support, they function very well, and I haven't had back pain from running in them like I get from other shoes. HOWEVER, the insole began falling out less than a month after purchasing. And I thought it was just the lining and it would be fine, but it's the whole \"CloudForm\" bottom and if I take it out, the shoe becomes very hard and not comfortable.", "The color of the shoes is beautiful, but the design was bad for me. The whole toe of the shoes is mesh, which is awesome for getting airflow. The shoe then becomes a hard plastic right at the arch of my foot. It seemed only mildly annoying, so I gave them a chance. It seems that because of that mildly annoying piece of plastic, I have been putting extra stress on the outside of my foot and it's caused tendonitis. So, I'll be giving these shoes away. I've learned my lesson about buying shoes online.", "I got the black/white combo and the black is more of a charcoal than black, which is a nice for switchin' it up. I walk about 3/4 a mile one-way just to class (at leash four or five miles total) everyday and they keep my feet from hurting.

Very poor quality, will not recommend.", "I am normally a solid 7.5 in most shoes - with Adidas I always go with a 7 and it fits perfectly. I bought these to lightly jog in a few times a week. As an avid runner that used to only wear Mizuno, I can say that these are fantastic for light jogs and tempo training. Make sure you're sticking to road running - these would not do too well with cross country trails.", "There\u2019s a lot of pictures for the White cloudfoam shoes so I thought I should upload some pictures of the black shoes. They are foam-like but it isn\u2019t a squishy layer like the original adidas shoes. That\u2019s probably because they\u2019re for training and any more squish would make them heavy. They\u2019re very comfortable. The insole is removable and the over all design is very nice. The only peculiar thing is the plastic, but it\u2019s a very cool touch. They also come with the signature cute neon green cloudfoam keychain.", "These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I am serious.

My normal size fits and feels very comfortable and supportive without being bulky and large. Love the look very sleek! The only thing is it seems like the toe box of the shoe is meant for wide feet because it\u2019s a little bigger. That\u2019s why I think even if you sized half down it would also work.

Not only for exercising purpose but for casual wear looks great.", "They were comfortable at the beginning, but the material expands so my feet would feel as if they were floating around in the shoe. I couldn\u2019t use my custom made inserts because it would make my feet tilt out and cause more pain. I would have given it a four, but just over a month of use they ripped beside the shoelace. I was so disappointed!", "GF really loved the look, and wasn't disappointed. Feel is overall very comfortable. The only thing that she did not care for is the back somewhat lost it's ability to stand up when she puts them on and sometimes they \"fold\". It's easy just to pop back in place, and she says she's always been rough on shoes, but I have to question the quality a little as she doesn't wear them out much, or use them to work out in. So, overall 4/5 for looks and comfort, but would recommend something a little sturdier if you plan on using them to work out, as they would probably break down super quickly.", "I ordered these several months ago and when I tried them on, they were so tight around my feet. I have never tried on a pair of shoes in my regular size being that narrow. And I don't have wide feet. Not sure how other Adidas shoes fit, but I recommend getting a half to a size up on these. I didn't get another pair after I returned them because I just decided to get a shoe that actually fit in my regular size.", "Very comfortable and unique looking. I got these shoes because I was going on a weekend trip requiring much walking. I didn't have any shoes with enough support, but these really exceeded my expectations. If walking or standing for many hours, I'd suggest adding a sole insert.", "I've probably had about 50 nike Shoes but decided to try Adidas and I usually run 10-15 miles a week. These are not comfortable. I've tried to break them in only for my feet to be sore. I have to wear double socks just for it to be comfortable.

They were a little big but I knew the size smaller would be too small! I love these shoes! Get lots of compliments! I have bad feet from my dads side & these help a lot! I walk my dog about 2 miles a day & they are perfect! I don't run or hike so I can't review about that.", "Great padding around the ankle. The laces start higher on the top of your foot than normal shoes and I think it makes it way more comfortable. You get more adjustment wear needed. I use these for up and downhill runs and outside stair climbing.", "Comfy overall but the toe bed is very wide, sometimes causing me to slip forward in the show as I run. The design looks nice but the material is almost too flexible, doesn't give a ton of stability. For anyone with high arches, you will need to add inserts to these. I have medium arches and after my first run in them my arches were killing me. The inserts have helped a lot. Good for hiking, not ideal for running.", "These shoes are very comfortable! I wear a size 9.5-10 and would say that the 10 is snug.

I also had an unrelated foot injury before getting these and the shoes have been very comfortable and supportive for my rehabilitation!", "I love these shoes. It's like wearing a soft T-shirt for your toes. The plastic side stripes are nice because they provide a tight support for the arch.

Months later they are still in good condition. There is a runners limit, not sure what that would be. I plan to buy more next time I need a pair of sneakers.", "I am a registered nurse and I\u2019m typically on my feet and moving for a good 14 hours during a shift. These are better than any shoe I have ever bought for work. My feet aren\u2019t even sore at the end of a shift. I actually have multiple pairs as back up", "When you wear them, your feet fell so comfortable, they are very soft. But after some certain distance of walking, my toes of both foot feel so pain! I wonder if I should take a size bigger or they don't have enough space at all?", "I buyed a pair for my sister in size 9US. It run a quite strech in the front part, above the toes. Good quality but the sole is a quite hard but not uncomfortable.", "Fit well and are a great workout shoe. The details in the craftsmanship is lacking since there are glue lines around the edges of the sole. If you can overlook that they shoe is a good buy.", "I had to return shoes. It was too tight around the toe area. I have two other pair Adidas size 10 and they fit fine.", "Perfect fit, very comfortable. I hit all the stores within an hour trying to find a new pair of adidas I liked before deciding to purchase these. These were $25-40 less than anything else I found, an much better quality in my opinion. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase!", "The most comfortable pair of sneakers I have owned. Like walking on a cloud. I\u2019m always a 7.5 and they fit perfect", "I love adidas sneakers. They always fit well and last a while for me as im on my feet 40+ hours a week. But these have to be the worst adidas I\u2019ve ever gotten. The backs don\u2019t hold up at all. I have to completely loosen the laces all the way to make sure the back doesn\u2019t collapse as I\u2019m putting them on and even then sometimes it still collapses. Won\u2019t be buying these again", "I'm giving these shoes a low rating for the fact that the soles squeak as if they're wet or something sticky is on the bottom . No matter what surface . I had these shoes for work because I'm on my feet 12-16 hours a day and they are so comfortable! But this pair is so embarrassing because the squeaking is so loud.", "Order a size down if you like these to fit snug; they feel better if they fit snug. They are very lightweight and comfortable", "Not sure why others said to size up but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t! I\u2019m a size 9.5 and bought a 9.5 and they fit perfect. Super comfortable and will be great for a trip to LA next month.", "Love the shoe. Fits well feels nice. Not sure what others are expecting in terms of quality for a $40 shoe. It was intact and a nice design. Already went running in them and they are very lightweight.", "The shoes are made a little more on the cheap side. Even though I paid less than other store offers I'm still annoyed that with wearing them less than a week they're already falling apart and I doubt will last long.", "Runs large. I\u2019m normally a 10.5-11 (narrow) and the 10 fit wide with room to spare. That said, I returned this item because the heel is uneven (lower on the outer edge) and threw me off balance. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a design flaw, but the only time I\u2019ve seen a heel like that is on a running shoe that\u2019s been worn down.", "They're comfy and breath well, but where the white sole is actually 1/2 white and 1/2 black. And the black part runs off easily showing white underneath. My shoes aren't even that old but they look old. Sad face.", "As always, Adidas delivers a quality and comfortable shoe. The design is classic and they keep my feet supported while I am at the gym.", "I usually order a larger size in running shoes but these were way too big. I compared them to the same size Nike running shoe I own and it was bigger. What a shame since they are very cute.", "They were not as vibrant in color as pictured. Other than that they fit great, I wear a size 6 and they were true to size with a little extra toe room.", "The insoles are not nearly as comfortable as I expected compared to other adidas I own - I wouldn't repurchase but perfectly fine product and they look nice and fit true to size.", "Love the cloud, so soft! I purchased a 9.5 because I like space for my toes when I jog or play sports. But 9.5 was huge! I ordered the 9 and thought it would fit perfect, which it does but was hoping for a smidge more room. I really enjoy them nonetheless!", "If you've ordered Adidas shoes in the past, order the same size as your other Adidas shoes and they should fit the same. Adidas shoes have a wide toe box which works for those who need it. These particular sneakers are no exception. They look and feel great. I use them for team sports on asphalt and hockey dek and are comfortable on both.", "Great for day to day wear. Look good. Comfy. Can also run in them.", "I needed these for work and standing long hours during the day (12+ hours). They work and are stylish.", "I was hoping for a more snug fit. I bought ASICS at 9/12, and these feel like the same size at 9. I decided to keep them but won\u2019t likely run in them because they aren\u2019t snug enough.", "I bought these Adidas shoes for walking and they are just right. The Adidas fit is always good for me, just a little roomy, which I like.", "Love them! Wore them more than eight hours, I walked about 15,000 steps and my feet felt pretty good. Usually they feel achy with my other shoes.", "Loooove these shoes especially for the price. The design is sleek but very breathable. It's not the most comfortable shoe in the world, but for it's price, I take them to the gym with me every day and don't have a problem.", "The shoes are nice-looking, but for some reason, the right was smaller than the left. This made them unwearable, and back to Amazon they went.", "The toe box is really wide.... which makes wearing this while running really weird. So I use these just for regular gym sessions or running around town on errands. I would not recommend these for actual running.", "I returned these shoes. The color is NOT at all as pictured. These were ugly and for the brief time I wore them they were not comfortable and they fit small.", "True to size. And the best part of it it's the feel of walking on clouds, that's the best feeling ever. It doesn't make a sound when you're walking with them.", "Had these shoes from Februrary to May, only used while at work, sitting at a desk. Everytime I walk it makes this clicking like sound, as if an air pocket has popped. Super annoying.", "Not as soft as I was hoping for and a little big, but overall great tennis shoes.", "I love these shoes. They are so light and the soles are very comfortable. I have worn them almost every day for around 2.5 months and they show no sign of wear.", "I wanted a bright white pair of tennis shoes. These shoes clean up nicely after washing!", "Very uncomfortable shoe. My feet hurt so bad, just after wearing them for an hour. I had to change shoes .", "Looks slightly more like a \"dad\" shoe in real life than it does in the photo. Very comfortable, but the soles started detaching and falling apart after about 2 months of wear.", "I'm glad that I read all the reviews that advised to order a half or full size down. I ordered a half size down and with socks they fit perfectly. They are very comfortable. I purchased the all white and it looks just like the picture. For $37, a great buy.", "They are light... I use them at the gym. No complaints", "Super comfy...my husband has these in the mens black and he told me how comfortable they were. I bought these to see and I'm not disappointed. Fits as expected. I usually wear a 6 and 6 fits great. Love them.", "I literally wore them for an entire day. I did about 10 hours of walking outside on pavement and some dirt areas; regular walking no climbing or intense working out and they have a small hole now in both the big toes. For the price I paid I am very upset and felt others should know this before buying.", "The inner sole of the shoe keeps sliding and coming out since the day we purchased it. My daughter is really uncomfortable with it. Otherwise this is a great shoe.", "I love these shoes for running. There is plenty of toe room and the cushy sole is fantastic. In most running shoes, I would order a full size up in order to have plenty of toe room, but I do not need to do that with Adidas.", "So far so good! Very cute and comfy for the gym. You see what you get. Usually size 7 in sneakers but went with the 6.5 & glad I did!", "Very cute shoes, but I ended up returning because the toe bed wasn't comfortable on my foot. Would consider ordering again in maybe a half size bigger", "Very comfy and I get compliments on them all of the time. Last night I walked through a muddy area and the mud EASILY rinsed right off of them. Fits as expected. Great product!", "Absolutely love these sneakers! They are by far the most comfortable I've ever had. Adidas rocks!", "Love Adidas's cloud foam. This is my 2nd pair. They're so comfortable.", "I have somewhat narrow feet and am between sizes of 8.5 and 9 in foot length. I bought these in 8.5 and they fit wondefully length- (there is still some room at the toes) and width-wise.", "I like everything about thaws shoes. I work in a facility where I\u2019m constantly on my feet and moving so I need a good shoe with support. This shoe gives me the best support and are also quite stylish. I read some of the reviews about sizing but for me these fit just fine. Overall great shoe with great support!!", "These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had! The cloud insole describes itself perfect. They also hug my foot and stay in place without having to retie. Wish I could afford to by different colors!", "This shoe is very comfortable and supportive of my deep arch. Would def recommend purchasing.", "I\u2019m usually an 8 and got a size 8. Think I should of gotten a 7 or 7.5. It still fits, but just not as fitted as I\u2019d like. Very comfortable and very stylish", "Im a 7-7 1/2 bought these in an 8 due to swellimg when i run and and ankle injury needing to be wrapped. They fit perfectly.", "I am on my feet a lot at work and these feel great. I ordered my regular size 8.5 and they run a little big.", "These shoes didn't have as much squish in them as I expected, and they were a touch bulkier. The model for my knowledge on these shoes was based on a similar shoe that adidas doesn't make anymore. These are still really good shoes though. They are comfortable, and they look good. The colors are so pretty.", "I like that these breathe. I wore them to the gym and was very pleased with my workout. Thank you.", "This shoe fits like a glove! Great for running or just to wear casually with a pair of jeans.", "So I got these for my girlfriend and according to her, these are the best running shoes ever. So yeah.", "Fit was a little small and just wasn\u2019t the fit I expected. Am trying to return now.", "Love these. They are very comfy. My only issue is that sometimes the sole insert comes out when you take them off. But i love them so it\u2019s ok.", "Came fast, super cute, not sure if I\u2019m keeping them because I don\u2019t really need running shoes right now. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with the product", "Ripped after 5 months The original last up 5-10 years", "Nice & comfy. I usually wear a 9 but in these they would\u2019ve been better in a 9.5. My toe is less than half an inch from the end but they\u2019ll work.", "They are very nice shoes, light weigth which I like, they are very confortable to walk, but not sure if they are good to run or jump, since not cushioned enough. But I'm very happy with them.", "I ordered the black pair. Love these shoes! So comfortable and great for working out. Fits true to size.", "Bought them for my daughter and she loves them. She works out in them, runs in them, and even hikes Civil War Battlefields in them. No complaints!", "I would recommend getting .5 a size up, width is great and laces can be adjusted to make shoe fit looser/tighter. They\u2019re definitely authentic and I couldn\u2019t be happier with them!", "These are nice shoes for the price. Im a true size 6, ordered a 6 and it fit as expected. Haven't tested it yet for running, but its very light as there is not much cushion on the footbed. I bought this to replace my old adidas climalite shoes and this is just as comfy.", "Shoes looked used. There was hair in the box. Even the box was destroyed looking. Not a quality seller.", "I normally wear a 7.5. Reading the reviews ordered a 7. I could have went a whole size down since it\u2019s still a little bit big. But I\u2019d definitely order these shoes again. Great for running, super comfy and very pretty shoes", "I ordered the true blue, and received a periwinkle blue. I love the periwinkle, which is why I didn't give these 1 star. But it's not what I ordered. They're very comfortable and true to size. But puleeeease just send folks what they order.", "Love these shoes, they are so comfortable. It feels like I'm walking on a cloud", "Bought these in my normal running shoe size (8). Had to exchange for a 7.5. Runs big. Seems very cushiony so far. Not really good for running, but good for working out or walking. Aesthetic wise, my big toe pokes up through the top mesh (And I wonder how long before it wears through). Wanted an all white shoe for gym...pretty good so far, especially for the price.", "Nice shoes but the size chart isn\u2019t correct at all. Please review it.", "The shoes are comfortable and fit as expected. I'm an 8 and these are a comfy 8. However, they look like they have been worn. There are scuff marks on several areas of the shoes. The glue is also exposed between the shoe and the sole. I guess that's what you get when you pay $60 for adidas. Lower quality manufacturing.", "These shoes have no arch support and they made my feet tingle and go numb within the first five minutes of wearing them even though they were too big.", "These shoes didnt last very long. But i also run alot. However, there was a nail from the bottom that began to pierce through the inner lining of the shoe. I ended up getting a cut on my foot because of it.", "Read comments and ordered makes size and they are too small. Shouldn't have listened to reviews. Will reorder on actual size.", "The back lip of sneaker is going down. Poor quality!! Too bad I cannot return because past my return window.", "DO NOT BUY.

I own 4-5 different pair of sport shoes all diferente brands and this ones are my favorite by far! Super comfortable!", "Great light shoes but I expect them to wear out extremely quick. Very slick bottoms. Not made to be run on any slick surface or for hiking.", "Super soft, love this sole for my cardio days. Color is much more orange then pictured", "I like these shoes however they run big. I should have gotten a smaller size", "Terrible quality! Not even a month of use and the heel notch/Achilles notch, the part of the shoe at the very back where your Achilles tendon is, got stuck at the bottom and I haven\u2019t been able to fix it!", "I wore it as soon as I received it to break it in and as soon as I slipped it on it felt amazing! I love this shoes!!! It's pretty to look at too but on top view it looks big and bulky but I don't really care. I think it's pretty on me and it's so comfy!", "I got one lil spot on them .wipe it and spot turned yellow .tried to wash them? Got more all mesh got yellow only wore them once.waste of money", "Best sneakers I\u2019ve ever owned! These are so lightweight and comfortable! I do Orangetheory and needed a good lightweight sneaker, and these are perfect!", "Had to get used to white shoes .... they are so nice ! And no crussed toes", "I love these.

I normally wear a 9. I ordered these in an 8.5 and they fit great.", "The heels to both shoes are crushed. Don\u2019t feel good. I always wear adidas and never had this happen", "Love these shoes. Perfect balance and they have helped me with some back issues I've had. But definitely order half a size smaller. Addidas cloud shoes run large.", "Very comfortable, and very breathable material. These are not waterproof if you were wondering!", "Love them. Perfect all blk shoe i was looking for.", "Super comfortable specially when working at a medical office. Running up and down the whole day, I don\u2019t even feel sore at the end of the day anymore", "Love these Adidas. Perfect for the gym or every day wear.", "It looks nice outside but the inside looks like fake like they just stitched it.

I ordered another pair, same line, different vendor, and the other pair is better quality.", "Was very excited for these shoes. But they are too tight over the top of my foot.

Very comfortable and light weight.", "Seem comfortable but the color is totally different than advertised. It is not a true blue with black stripes/laces.

Otherwise great shoe.", "I would highly recommend these shoes. They are extremely comfortable and look great.", "I have been searching for a new bootcamp shoe for awhile and stumbled upon these. They are a neutral shoe so if you're looking for arch support these are not for you. I wear a 9 in athletic shoes and this shoe fit perfectly lengthwise. The width is a little wide for someone with narrow feet. And my foot sets deep into the shoe so the padding was rubbing on my ankle bone. I bought a slim pair of plain shoe cushions (nothing fancy, just those cheap flat shoe cushions) and put them under the shoe insert. Worked perfectly. Now my foot sets higher which also helps with the width of the shoe. I would buy these again.", "These tend to run a little on the large side.

Im usually a 9 and ordered an 8 and fit just fine. What I don't like? I have to keep readjusting the laces because they tend to be a little tight around the arch and cramp my feet a little if I don't loosen them over and over. They're also not THE MOST comfortable sneakers ever but they're solid. And for the price, I think it's more than fine. The color is the same.", "Made a squeaky sound after a while even when they're not wet. The shoes are not waterproof either.", "They fit perfectly and are really comfortable shoes!

The size is too big, though. I got a 5.5, it looked like a 7.", "I bought these shoes to use for cross-training workouts and walking. So far, I love them!

Awesome seller to work with as well.", "Loved the shoe until the tread started clicking with every step!", "The fit was true to size for me. The soles were loose from the get go and after a short amount of time that I\u2019ve owned they are no longer in the shoe. Another note, the back of the shoe bends in whenever I insert my foot but only on one shoe. Not a size issue but it\u2019s clearly poorly made. Won\u2019t get this brand/style again", "will need some breaking in, feels stiff, no arch, very little shock absorption. I really think this is also a casual shoe or maybe for people that run less then 5 miles or for work.", "I love these shoes for their comfort and fit.

I am a loyal customer because the shoes have been the best for my feet!", "The shoes feel great and look great but you can clearly see the glue of the soles. I recently purchased some at sports academy and no glue was seen on them. So just be careful when you do order these online.", "This is by far one of the most comfortable athletic shoes I have purchased. The material is very breatheable and does not crowd your feet in the shoe. I have wide feet and bought size 9.5 very comfy!", "i love how comfy they are these are promptly made for running so i love weight lifting so dont wear them for power sets their memeory foam sort of but they are excellent running shoes the only thing us i got the alll white pair and they got dirty sooo quickly but they are easy to clean love them people actualy think they are the adidas super boosts wich are way expensive so the fact they look like a differnt shioe model is prety sick too", "These shoes fit my feet perfectly, the style is stealthy and the foam sole feels like walking on clouds.", "Great product that does not used child labor to be created!! The toe box is large so when you get warm and your feet swell a little, they are still super comfortable. Very light weight material.", "This is one of the most comfortable sneakers I have owned! Love them!", "These shoes are my favorite work out shoes I\u2019ve ever owned. They are so comfy and look awesome they were true to size for me I\u2019m usually a 7 and the 7 got perfect.

They have a wide base for balance and a thicker sole for jumps and running.", "Perfect. First time wearing them, walked 30 mins to the gym to \"break them in\" had a squat session and it was a pleasant surprise. These shoes are so comfortable and flat, perfect for lifting... This coming from someone that uses vibrams fivefingers and walks barefoot whenever possible... This shoe, for me, offer that flat feeling with the added cushion. I like the barefoot feeling, which this doesn't have but I really like them!! I always use 6 on athletic shoes so went ahead and ordered my size and it fits perfectly.", "I love these shoes; they are perfect for Crossfit, including WODs with some running. I even do some light running (up to 3 miles) in them as well. The survey asks how long I can wear them comfortably, but I use them for Crossfit, not wearing around all day like I would normal shoes. The survey also asks if they provide good arch support- well that's not what they are for anyways; so the fact that I answered \"no\", should not be a negative. If you are looking for a shoe with arch support, then these types of shoes are probably not for you.", "I just received these shoes and so far they are great. I have neuromas in both feet and they were recommended to me by my son, who is a crossfit coach. The toe box has plenty of room and I ordered my regular size. It is nice to have a shoe that is the right size and has room enough to not pinch but to support and not have my foot moving around or my heel coming out of the shoe when I do lunges. I can't wait to wear them on a hike and see how they work out in that kind of activity.", "LOVE these Nanos. I just finished Filthy 50 and I felt like I was walking on air. The support is incredible and they really help soften the impact you feel with box jumps. Highly recommend for Crossfit. They run about a half size too small, but ultimately you'd probably be okay with your regular size if you like a tight fit, I however like some breathing room. Also, I saw someone complain about the width in the toe box, but I watched a review on YouTube and that was done purposefully for squatting purposes etc. I suggest looking into their reasoning before returning them.", "I said the arch support wasn't \"good\" but it could just be my feet. I stuck a pair of insoles in them and they're fine. I did order an 8 instead of my street size 7.5 as recommended by other reviewers. That said, these shoes made a noticeable difference when I lift (I'm a newbie to cross fit). I was wearing my running shoes and was rolling up on my toes a lot. I don't think you can beat them for the price I paid.", "I'm an advanced workout person and really put a pounding on my shoes and I love these shoes. They look really nice even though, I only wear them when I'm working out at home. I would get another pair, if I couldn't find anything that was reasonably priced and also a minimalist shoe. I switched from the usual tennis shoe with high arches to minimal shoes and they are working for me.", "While I really like these shoes, I find that the toe area is quite roomy...almost too roomy for me. I've' tightened the laces as much as possible, but I still have quite a bit of room up there. I will probably put in insoles to compemsate. Be that as it may, the shoes are great. Very comfortable and with good support. I may try another pair to see if it's just my shoes or true to all the colors.", "I ordered a half size larger because that is what the other reviewers said to do. They fit me well and great color. They work great for crossfit type exercises. Only complaint is the arch support. I wish there was more support!", "These are a great color, more of a purple then the picture shows. I liked the fit, but the 9.5 was too short for my foot. The 10 is a little wide, but I still like the fit.", "These really are great shoes for crossfit. They are not as \"barefoot\" as one would want from a \"nano,\" but I've discovered they do work well at the gym, especially for those heavy lifting days when one wants more support than the barest of the barefoot shoes.", "This is the second pair of Nanos that I've bought. I love them. I do kickboxing, self defense, fitness, and weightlifting classes in them. I like the way the sole is attached. I had shoes before where the sole would come apart from the shoe because of the pivoting movements I do. Not these!", "Great CrossFit shoe. They are lightweight and very comfortable. Not to mention a good look with your workout clothes:) Only complaint would be they take some getting use too. For some reason they made my feet go numb the first couple times wearing them during a WOD. especially burpees. however I haven't had the issue since and they are a great lightweight shoe. do NOT recommend for long runs though.", "A little stiff the first few days of wearing, but I use them strictly for crossfit. My old pair were Nano 2's and I hated their pattern and coloring. The solid black with a splash of pink is a much more pleasing aestethic for me. The only negative comment I have is the toe box of the right shoe feels differently from the left, but isn't enough of a problem to worry over except for certain excercises, i.e. burpees.", "I knew these were wide at the toe when I bought them, so the weird shape wasn't a surprise. They are ugly! But I've been using them for a year, and they are well-made shoes. I use them exclusively for CrossFit 3x a week. They are fine for all CrossFit activities.", "I LOVE these shoes! I have a wider foot where my foot is the widest and these shoes for perfect. They make me more comfortable and stable during my WOD's and just all over. Would HIGHLY recommend. They are a great look too!!!", "This is my fourth pair...different color. I wear size 9 in all other shoes; this one size 10 fits. The wide toe box fits my feet. I wish the purple color were still in stock.", "These are excellent shoes for CrossFit! Really made a huge difference in my squats since I, not pitched forward by my shoes anymore. A few other women in my box wear these as well and swear by the Nanos!", "SO COMFORTABLE!!!! I recommend these shoes for anything (but running) for! They are so comfortable I culd sleep in them lol. They give you what you need for crossfit, I like the fact I can feel the ground per say when I do my crossfit work outs and I am able to get grip when I do rope climbs.", "I am never let down by Reebok Crossfit Nano's. I use them daily at the gym on weight machines and treadmill. They offer both good support and cushion. While the bright blue color was a little surprising at first, now it's fun.", "I use them with the insanity workout and noticed a greater ability within the workout due to better stability from the shoes. I would definitely recommend these shoes.", "Honestly, I wasn't sure at first! But I've been doing crossfit regularly for almost 3 months now and I'm SO glad I got these shoes!! GREAT starter shoes for crossfit...I'm SURE I'll upgrade with the Reebok's as I get better!", "I love these shoes. These are my second pair of crossfit nano. These are however better looking and sleek. I found them really fantastic so far. The U shape is the same as 2.0, but maybe less evident, making it for a perfect shoe. I also feel like this pair provides better support for running.", "I wear a size 7 so it was a good thing i ordered a 71/2 because there is enough room for your toes instead of cramping them. I love working out in this shoes", "Style seems sufficient for its purpose, but I didn't like the lack of arch support, and the sizing is definitely off. I wear a 5, sometimes even a 4 1/2, and these in a 5 were too short for my foot.", "I really enjoy these shoes. They were comfortable from the moment I put them on, and have enough of a sole that it doesn't wear through with my heavy exercise-walking the way \"naked\" shoes do.", "These are by far my favorite athletic shoes ever!!! They are very comfy and have super grip!!!! I bought the pink and also bought pink boxing gloves, they are a near perfect match. I look so stylish at the gym now.", "My wife's I love with these shoes ! They are her first pair of cf style shoes ! The toe room is great and they are very sturdy ! Must own these !", "Love these shoes! They made a significant difference in my WODS compared to my high end running shoes I wore. Was not sure about size, I wear 9-9 1/2 in a running shoe, 8 1/2 in a casual shoe. Being a narrow width I chose 8 1/2 and they are just right. What is so great about this training shoe is that you can feel the ground underneath you for stability, but enough cushion for protection.", "I bought these shoes for Combat training and plyometrics. I was really disappointed. There is very little flexibility in the forefront of the shoe. They feel stiff, clunky and heavy. They might be a good all around gym shoe for anything that requires stability.", "Love, love, love these shoes. Bought a pair for my mother in pink. They are comfortable and fantastic cross-fit shoes.", "I have a very high arch and been having a lot of problems finding a comfortable shoe to play in. I played 6 hours straight at a family entertainment play center in these and couldn't believe my feet did not kill me. There is no break in period with these either. LOVE LOVE LOVE!! And I really Love the color scheme!! Well worth the money! Will definitely buy again!", "This shoe made a huge difference in my training. I use to struggle for sore and tired sometimes even pain full feet during crossfit training. NO MORE! Great product, great fit, al around a really good shoe for weight training.", "Ok shoe.... would have liked more cushioning. I do HIIT 3 times a week plus muscle and cardio classes, so I am a high frequency user. I liked my Reebok Sharks more, but Nano has better lateral stability.", "Bought these to wear after ear surgery cause my balance is going to be off. GREAT love these. I will be buying more even though I don't do cross fit.", "I purchased these for my wife at Xmas. She loved them. The colors were great and they are super comfortable. She kept bragging about them so I went out and purchased more.", "Great shoe, just order a half size up. The shape of the front of the shoe makes the half size up necessary. I don't do crossfit, but I love these shoes when I am doing my own workouts -- push ups, jumping jacks, etc... I would NOT buy these if you need a shoe for running.", "Great shoes. Along with being incredibly stable while working out in crossfit over a large variety of exercises, they are comfortable enough to wear if you are on your feet for hours. No other shoe I own is like that.", "Absolutely love them and still use them till this day", "Was told to go up a size so I ordered an 8. The 8 was way too big, had to return them. Don't think I will even try getting a 7.5 because I think the toe box was too wide for my liking.", "Bought them one half-size larger than my regular work shoes to allow for my feet to expand during workout. They are extremely comfortable and lightweight and I have a better stance when lifting, yet these shoes are durable enough for the jumping, rowing, running in the CrossFit box. Highly recommend.", "Love, Love, Love! I have the Nano 2.0 also and love those too. I am excited that the 3.0 has a little more stability for running. Great for all my crossfit work outs.", "I bought these shoes to use for Crossfit. They are well made, my only problem is that there is no arch support. I tried to put Dr. Scholls arch support in them, but that makes the shoes too tight. I'm going to wear them only for workouts, but I don't think I will be able to wear them outside of the gym due to lack of support.", "The moment I put these on I completely fell in love with them. They are just what I need for my HIIT workouts, burpees are even easier somehow!", "I am very picky about my shoes, workout shoes especially. I have extremely flat feet and a bad achilles tendon in one heel. These shoes allowed me to jog and workout the first day I put them on with no pain. I plan to buy another pair for everyday use.", "It took me awhile to find a good pair of workout shoes that fit my foot comfortably with a low heel. So far these shoes have been great for crossfit/cross training. Good for the average to wider foot. I can wear a 6 1/2 to 7 and ordered a 7. Perfect size. The only reason I did not give them a 5 is only because I need more time training in them.", "I love this product. There are more room for my toes and of course I have flat feet and they don't hurt my feet at alll because there isn't arch support. If you have high arches this type of shoes are not for you.", "These shoes are just what I was looking for. They are comfortable. They do not hurt my feet when working out which is a total plus.", "Love these shoes. Super comfortable. All I wear to the gym.", "Love the style and feel of these shoes. No issues with chafing or blistering during my first few WOD's.", "Excellent shoes for CrossFit. Provides stability when doing weights. I can also run and do cardio activities in them with no issue.", "These shoes are beautiful, I received many compliments and they fit my feet perfectly. Will be purchasing this shoe again in another color.", "I just love my Crossfit shoes! The price couldn't be beat! They were delivered early and the quality is great! They are perfect!", "great product....classy and gets alot of attention from others at the gym.", "Love these reebok crossfit shoes. I have 3 pair now and they are very comfortable. A great workout shoe!", "I am new to crossfit and decided I needed shoes to match. This is a great sneaker, I feel stable in the movements we do at the gym, whether it's lifting, jumping or running.

They look great and feel great, too", "They fit as expected and I love them. I wear them normally on endudance/cross training days and wear minimalist shoes for strength days.", "The shoes for as expected. They are a wide shoe. Very stable around top of foot.

I've gotten so much use out of them, and compliments! They fit perfect and are so comfortable!", "LOVE! Perfect for running, hiking, jump-roping and cross-fit training. These shoes are very comfortable!", "I wear this for my cross training/circuit classes. Good shoe for squats, lunges, box jumps, not so much for running.", "The shoes are very comfortable and give you the extra strength in your heels you need for lifting and squats.

Have really helped in my training. The flex and grip are fantastic.", "Best shoes for a wod! They're super comfortable and if u get them wet they will dry out very fast", "My daughter and I both wear size 5. The size 5 I purchased are a little too snuggle on my feet, but fits my daughters just right. So I'd say the width is on the narrow side.", "These are great shoes, but they do not have a lot of support. They were not made to comfortably run in. They do the job, but I might switch back to my Asics just so I can run more comfortably.", "I don't do crossfit but am a daily weight lifter. I've been wearing Chucks as my gym shoes for the past year but sad I waited as long as I did to try these out. The are super comfortable, light, and don't interfere with my form while performing squats or deadlifts. The color is great as well!", "Fits well, the toes are shaped like a foot.

Will most likely return them.", "A little too roomy in the toes for me but otherwise a great shoe", "This is my second pair and love the comfort.

Great for crossfit.", "My foot feels more stable now when doing squats I love them", "Super cute and perfect for cross fit. My coach referred me to this shoe and they have worked great for me. I am between a 7 and 7.5 and I'm glad I got the 7.5.", "They fit as expected. So you DO have to order at least half of size of your regular one.

They sent me shoes , but they sent me waist was 5.5 uk 25cm . and I need 4.5 uk 24cm , I get a little big , the color is fine !! roses as they sent me! is there any chance that I contraptions ? They can send and send them when I return these ? thx !!!!!!", "I bought the nano 3.0 for my wife. she is very picky about her training shoes. one workout she was sold! they are good at everything. lifting,running,jumping,and climbing rope. it's because of the break in the sole across the toes for flexabilty.", "Shoes are great for stability, suck to run in but that doesn't bother me.

These are so ridiculously comfortable!", "Perfect shoes for my boot camp classes. Help with my balance and lifting stance.", "Besides the bit-too-small size, this is a pretty solid shoe. Crossfit/high intensity interval training in them feel great. I sweat a whole lot, and luckily, these shoes don't stink up so bad and take forever to dry like their Inov-8 competitor. About the size--honestly, I think these shoes were designed to fit your foot snugly for the type of exercise it was designed for. Some people may find it too uncomfortable and may want to order half a size bigger than they usually wear. But if you like a snug fit so that your feet won't move around so much when you lift heavy weight, I recommend getting them in the size you usually wear.", "I have only used then for two WOD's so far but I can tell a difference in terms of keeping my bakance while lifting.", "This is my first experience with Nanos and I am 100% in love! I use them strictly for crossfit. I was looking for shoes that I could do weightlifting in during the wods as well as ones that I could do the cardio within the WOD and not have to change shoes.

They are perfect.", "The fit was good, I have wide feet and I'm usually a 9, but got these in 8.5 as most 9 training shoes are too big for me, the only thing with them is that my toes touch the front of the shoe a bit uncomfortably. However, I do like the shoe very much.", "My shoes showed up a day earlier than I expected!! The fit was perfect, ordered the same size I would with any other Reebok shoe. Wore for the first time yesterday and I could tell the difference with my stance and form. I've taught weight lifting classes for years and just started Crossfit a few months back. My coach recommended that I get \"flat\" bottom shoes because I was complaining about my balance in low squatting moves. These are AWESOME, I'm always telling my class members to sit into their heels and drive through the leg. I could totally tell the difference of the set of my heel and weight.", "It's cute.

I've climbed the rope several times and have not seen any damage as had happened to previous models.", "I think I will like these better when I get my size 9s...9.5s were just a little too loose in the toe box (length wise) but the width on these is great for my wide feet. Can't wait to try them out Friday for the open!", "My Reebok Nano's fit as expected and I really like them. They feel solid especially when lifting or box jumping. They are a little wider in the toe box then my Innovates. I am also going to look into the Reebok trainer shoes, I hear the toe box is even wider. Great shoe, fun colors -", "Shoes are great.

I love the red and black colors. Cindy", "Love this shoe. Wear them all the time! I got them for my birthday in July 2013. Everyone in the box was jealous and had to get a pair of their own.They have definitely have improved my form and I feel study when I use them. They are incredibly light and the color looks awesome. However, if your are lifting heavy weight I would reccomend some lifting shoes, but if you were to do the regular RX in a WOD they definitely help.

These really are great shoes for Crossfit. The toe box has plenty of room and I ordered my regular size. Love love love my Nanos! They fit perfect! They are so comfortable! This shoe made a huge difference in my training.\n"}, {"entity_id": "B010N5X9UO", "meta_review": "You'd have a hard time finding a more comfortable, better looking shoe for a lower price, which makes the Coudfoam Ilations an awesome deal. The foam insoles and midsoles of these good-looking shoes are off the charts in terms of comfort, plus the mid-ankle cut gives them classic, stylish looks on and off the court Rare reports of sizes being somewhat narrow but most owners rave about them fitting true to size", "source_documents": ["These are great shoes. For me they fit just a tad big - and that's being particularly picky. Other than that these are pretty solid balling shoes. The neutral gray color is quite delightful as it lulls my defenders to sleep as I brick shots in their face all day long. EDIT 2017-02-10 These shoes were great for all about 2-2.5 weeks of playing on them. As one other buyer pointed out the soles on both of my shoes were defective and started peeling back causing a dangerous condition where I would be tripping over the now folded back rubber. I've tried shoe gooing them as well as super glue to no help. Buyer beware of defective soles!", "cloudfoam is pretty rad! these are more comfortable than some double price nikes I had. in fact, them nikes kinda looked like cowboy boots and were tight in the toes, these are the opposite. I don't wear basketball shoes in real life, just at my lame job (cuz they're good for walking and protect my ankles from bonking on stuff) I'm sure they are great for other things too, like pogoing or kicking someone in the nuts.", "Maybe it's just me but I had really bad luck with these shoes. I ordered a pair because I like Adidas and the price is great. On my 3rd time playing in these a large piece of rubber on the bottom of the shoe came unglued. I sent them back and received a new pair of the same shoes (hoping I had a random defective shoe). On my second pair a chunk of rubber completely came off while I was playing, and it was on the first night I wore the shoes! I am giving 2 starts instead of 1 because it was easy to return them for a refund.", "I absolutely love these shoes. Very sharp and stylish, but never mind that. These are the most soft and comfortable shoes i have ever worn. Airmax has nothing on these Cloudfoam Addidas. My all time new favorite shoes period! And the price!", "My husband loves his new Adidas NEO Cloidfoams. At first he thought they were just a regular pair of sneakers until he slipped his feet into them. He noticed the difference right away. He is in work boots all day, every day and he said it was nice to put his feet into something light and comfortable for a change. Thanks l think l got a happy husband, and that makes me happy. And you know what they say about a happy wife.", "These shoes are the best thing I ever purchased. I work ten hour shift walking all day and my feet do not hurt at all. They are so cushioned it's almost ridiculous I highly recommend if you are working all day on your feet.", "These are the most comfortable basketball shoes I've ever owned. They are plenty wide (4E) for my very wide feet and also have sufficient height space for the taller foot shape. The build quality feels very durable as well. I have absolutely no complaints about these shoes even after 5 months of wear 1-2 a week. Another friend I play with coincidentally got the same shoes but in regular (not wide) and also likes it.", "These look like Ross off the racks but they caught me off guard! They are good! I was not expecting a lot because of the very reasonable price. They easily exceeded my expectations. The cloud foam is for real. In fact, the cloud foam is so good that i ran on the treadmill in these! Real talk. I have been searching for a basketball shoe like this! These remind me of the old Avia basketball shoes that were super comfortable and bouncy. Makes me wonder why Adidas doesn't have a whole lines of products based around the cloud foam technology! These are a big win for the consumer in terms of value proposition. Highly recommend!", "I work a 12-hr shift on weekends and these shoes are wide and comfy enough to help relieve any ache from being on my feet during long work hours. No break-in period needed. They were superb right out of the box! update at 18 months: The right shoe is beginning to fall apart. The sole is separating at the front. I have shoes that have held together for a decade, or longer. I don't expect these to make it past a year before they are unwearable. Very comfy, but obviously something about the manufacture or construction isn't up to snuff. Minus three stars for failure to remain intact under modest wear.", "I got couple of pairs last year (Light blue & Gray/Navy Blue-Size 8D) and they were great, soft and fitted it perfectly; however, a year later I decided to get the navy blue-Size 8M, & according to vendor the 8Ds are compatible with 8Ms. Well, the shoes did not fit fine the height in the toe\u2019s area it\u2019s a bit narrow, so they fit a bit too tight. The solution to solve this issue was to replace the insoles for some thin ones. I ended up spending extra $14 to make it fit right. By the way, I have normal & thin feet, hopefully this helps.", "Traction is good. They have a lot of padding and support. At the price range the weight is as I expected. They are super comfortable. And seem stable enough at the start. I need some more okay and pick up games to know their overall quality. I'll be checking for ankle rollability and how much stretch these shoes have during play. Price is great. They look good. I mean you're not buying these to look like Jordans or HyperDunks. But they look clean enough while playing.", "The rubber on the bottom came off on BOTH SHOES after wearing them 4 times. I play competitive basketball, which means I'm planting hard, stopping on a dime, and really pushing the limit of my shoes, so I do end up buying new pairs of shoes pretty often. I thought I could get by with a cheaper pair, but these were by far the worst shoes I've ever purchased. Completely not durable. They may be fine for the average basketball player or somebody who just wants to casually walk in them, but I would highly recommend something else.", "I was skeptical due to some of the reviews that said this shoe might be too narrow. But I ordered them anyway since Amazon's return policy is so easy. My feet are pretty wide so I have trouble sometimes finding athletic shoes that fit well. I ordered one half size up from what I usually wear and these were a perfect fit. They are one of the most comfortable pairs of sneakers I've put on my feet, not to mention the price was super reasonable.", "Much better than I thought. Great value. I haven't played basketball in a couple of years, and wasn't sure if I'd want to get back into it, so Iooked for a low cost pair to start with, assuming I'd upgrade if it keep playing. Have used them twice, not blisters, very comfortable, decent floor grip, and I'm very happy overall, even as a shoe that I'll use until they wear out. Shocked at the value!", "I like very basic sneakers, which are getting increasingly difficult to find. My feet are quite wide, and these fit much better than other high tops (that I had actually tried on at a local sporting goods store.) Very basic, very comfortable, but I'm just wearing them for kicking around. Can't really recommend, or not recommend, for basketball.", "I purchased these for my husband and he loooooooves them. He says they fits very well: 1) They are comfortable and just what he was looking for (an all-black pair of basketball sneakers). He is on his feet ALOT during the day, and sometimes, he has to walk mannnny miles, so I am happy they are still bringing him so much joy AND comfort. He loves them so much that he wanted another pair, so we purchased the black and white one too :-)", "I walk my dog twice a day totaling 3-4 miles and these shoes hold up no matter what. Sun, rain, snow, heat, cold and they keep going for months. I recently wore out my first pair, only because the front rubber edge glue finally gave up, but the sole and leather are still pretty good. If I could find a glue that worked well on leather and rubber together, I'd keep them. Recently bought this new pair and they are exactly the same.", "I bought their Cloudifoam a few months ago, but another model. They were simply the best: soft, comfortable, fit. For some reason, this one is nothing like the previous one: absent memory foam insoles, rather hard surface inside and just doesn't feel right. I will be wearing them, but this pair of snickers is rather dissappointing. Two stars only because the look is nice and because its Adidas, so at least they won't fall apart in 4 months, like FILA.", "the laces deterorated immediately, like they actually tore the first time i tied them. You get what you pay for here, but there are some pros, these shoes are actually somewhat comfortable and seems like they can take a beating on the court, however, I have yet to play on concrete since it's winter and I don't expect them to last long. I will update review this summer.", "Out of the box, they felt very cushy and comfortable, and looked ok. But, within a month or so, it felt as though the \"Cloudfoam\" had compacted too much and wasn't providing a soft landing. I have been able to get ~7 months of moderate use out of them, but have had to add extra foot and ankle supports. My kneeds have been feeling extra tired over the last month or so -- I should have replaced these after about the 4 month mark.", "great fit very comfortable keep making this shoe they are hard to find.", "I bought these shoes in late February and I only wear them a few days a week for indoor basketball. The soles of the shoe have a section with the Adidas logo that came loose. Now there is a piece of rubber on the sole flapping around. This problem happened on both shoes so Im pretty sure its a problem with the shoe and not something I stepped on. Usually I can get a year or so out of shoes before the soles wear down but even then they don't break apart. I would return them if I could.", "Shoes worked great and were comfortable while they held together, after less than 10 times wearing these to play basketball, the sections of the sole under the balls of my feet on both shoes started separating. I got them for $35.99 so I guess they're priced low for a reason. I'm pretty disappointed. Another thing that is unrelated but bothered me a bit is how easily the part that covers the toe gets scuffed. Doesn't affect the way they feel, but after the first or second time wearing these both shoes were already scuffed up.", "Wow...I never new basketball shoes could be so comfortable. I bought them to take to the new basketball court they built near the house...just to shoot some old-man baskets. Fine for that, but now, I realize that these have the foamy feel of a running shoe, and are good as general kicks for wallking. Amazing shoe for the cheaper price. Lace them up tight from the bottom-up, and they fit great!", "I like them. They're also super lightweight. Update: 2 months in and the rubber on the bottom is no longer completely connected to the rest of the shoe. wowzers, fastest I've ever needed to replace sneakers..and they weren't even put through a lot. Terrible quality", "Horribly uncomfortable shoes. It's like wearing a tortured device on your feet. The interior material that is stitched up at the bottom of the laces presses down against the toes as you take a stride. As the sole bends and your toes curve upward when you walk this material is compressed down digging right into the top of your toes. Argh...so painful. The shoe fits, the size is correct, looks great and the leather is nice and strong, but poor attention to the interior detail makes this a horrible sneaker. It's not like you can break them in and the leather will soften over time, this section inside that compresses the toes will always be there.", "Good quality sturdy shoe, with much support for possible sporting type of activities. I bought these Adidas for a comfortable riding experience on a motorcycle while maintaining a stylish appearance. They have lived up to their expectations and more; the toe of shoes usually get dirty while riding motorcycles but these shoes have remained clean due to the easy to clean material. The fit is comfortable whether I want to lace it up tight or leave it looser for a more easy going look while out and about. Great purchase and good quality for a great price.", "Very happy, nice looking shoe and feel soft and cushiony inside. Bought a normal width 10.5 (my usual size) and the fit is perfect not too snug not too loose. The toe area is definitely wide which makes for a better fit when running on the court. One complaint is I don't like the fake leathery texture of the front of the shoe, I was expecting it to look more of a suede than a leathery look. But still excellent value for the price.", "These are very comfortable shoes. I very much prefer the Adidas cloud foam to the memory foam on so many other modern shoes. They are firm, supportive and don't break down in a couple months. The only gripe I would have is that they don't breathe real well in the summer and they tend to shrink when they get wet. But this is the second pair I've bought because I like them that much.", "I use these for basketball. Good fit, lots of cushion, good traction on a hardwood court. The laces are thin and sticky, making them a little hard to lace up. Happy overall for the price.", "The rubber sole peeled off the shoe after about eight uses on exclusively a hard wood floor. It happened on both shoes right under the ball of the feet. Also, when I switched to these I bruised my heel because the support structure is not as firm as my previous shoes. I should have bumped up for a more expensive pair. A number of other people I play with use these and do not seem to complain. But for the aggressive player who is cutting hard they were not up to the task for me.", "I received the shoes in a 8 regular instead of an 8 wide it was a gift , for the most part these shoes have great for arch support but, not for someone whom has wide ankles and feet. Since they came in the wrong width size unfortunately I am not able to produce the most accurate details about these shoes sadly, they must go back.", "These are supposed to be wide athletic shoes. I ordered a men's size 10 and they were not even close. I admit the cloudfoam does feel nice but there are other things such as memory foam that feel just as good. I would recommend either getting an extra wide or buying a different brand that actually makes wide shoes.", "All adidas shoes i have purchased run small and narrow including Neo cloudfoam thunder mid shoes. I order a size up. These run true to size so they are large on me but will do...just winter shoes. Neo thunder seem better made and better cushion in the sole. Couldnt beat the price though.", "My husband absolutely loves these shoes. The word 'cloudfoam' in the description accurately describes the comfort of these shoes. He's on his feet most of the day and these shoes allow him to do so with minimal pain in his feet and back. They fit true to size and we will be buying another pair so he can switch between the two.", "Excellent shoe n feel very comfortable. The only thing is the shoe lace feels very flimsey. Thus the 4 star rating. I was also hoping the side would stick out a little bit near the little toe joint. It seems to help with changing directions when playing basketball. However, can't complain about this pair of shoe because price n quality r excellent.", "My kid uses orthotics so we tend to get the shoes that go up the ankle to help keep them on, and frankly he grinds through shoes pretty fast. These held up well for more than a couple months so are worth a look.", "I bought the solid white pair in size 13. The fit for me is perfect. The insole is like walking on a cloud. I usually buy shoes in a wider width if available, these are normal width but feel like they are a bit wider than normal shoes, which is perfect for me. I'll be buying these in other colorways as well.", "Have been hoping to find a sneaker to help with a diminished fat pad in my left ball of foot . These are about the best I could hope for . They are orthotic friendly as the sides and tops are as comfy as the sole. Don't stop making these please . I have had a knee replaced as well and feel good about wearing these . Price is right too..", "Second time I've fallen for this one. Adidas \"made in Vietnam\" are just made at the WRONG SIZE! Every pair I've ever bought as \"made in China\" are perfect. Point of assembly should be in the listing. I'll never buy another Adidas shoe from Amazon (only brand I wear by the way) I can't trust it without being able to try on and wear. Returns were easy and just fine, but I'm DONE", "The toe box is a little big, but other than that these were really comfortable once broken in (3-4 uses). Decent traction and the upper feels solid. Unfortunately, the tread is coming apart (6-7 uses INDOORS). Since I've only had them for two weeks, I will try to return them.", "Great shoe for a great price. My son found them in white at the store and said they were the most comfortable shoes he has had in some time - and he's worn much more expensive sneakers. Had to go on-line to find the black, but well worth it. My teen son stands a lot at his Home Depot job so really appreciate a comfortable, supportive shoe and this fit the bill! The price was just an extra bonus!!", "Fit perfectly,size 10 is a size 10.The foam is amazing,fits like a house slipper.The pure white will probably get me an ass kicking at work though,but that's what I ordered.", "Warning!! Purchased these shoes for my son and after only a few months of wear. They have melted after just one day left in the trunk of my car. It defies logic. We have often left a gym bag of cloths/ shoes in the trunk for use later in the evening or following school or for evening sports. The toes of these shoes curled & harded and the entire shoe both mind you are now completely stiff. I would not recommend at all!", "Had the shoes 3 months playing once a week on an indoor court. This is the second pair I have owned (1st pair purchased from another venue) and both have done the same thing. The tread on the shoes peels up. This time it peeled up on the left and right shoe", "My son is happy now, because in the different stores doesn't has any shoes with size 11, WIDE. He is where shoessupport, that is why he need to buy wide shoes. Thank you very much!", "wear these for work and still going strong I am on all different types of surfaces. I work in construction so there are mud dirt rocks concrete wood and they are holding up well", "That Adidas NEO Men's are beautiful color, comfort and quality. My son and my husband are happy happy with those shoes for your comfort and quality, color. We recommended those shoes. Thank you so much Amazon.", "Took them out the box and was pleasantly surprised in the quality. Then I put them on my feet and they felt amazing! I have bad feet to begin with...and this truly felt like walking on cloud nine \u2601 Gr8 shoe! Buy! Buy! Buy! Worth every dollar!", "I find this shoe a little tighter than I had expected. I think it is because the upper is leather and I like fabric. Shoe is well made and comfortable cloud foam .", "I sent these sneakers to my son He has a 15 minute walk to work 5 days or more a week. He called to say that these sneakers are starting to separate already! I decided to replace them with timberline boots on amazon Good price and soon he will be walking in inclement weather", "Very comfortable i been buying this shoe for almost 2 years now and they hold up pretty good.", "Purchased the Adidas Neo Cloudfoam for my husband's 66th Birthday! He has a really bad ankle that needs the support of high tops. These are great, very light weight and comfortable. He loves them! And Adidas is always true to size.", "These shoes are great, They've lasted me about 6 months now.I haven't played basketball in them, I read other reviews saying that they fall apart easily when playing basketball, however I bought them for just regular every day wear, and I do participate in backyard basketball/football every now and then and the shoes are still fully intact. Good quality shoes and durable!", "Bought for my husband. He's very picky when it comes to his shoes and he loves these shoes. But he does not play basketball in these shoes, sooo they lasted about a year before anything started peeling. Overall we are happy with these shoes and ordered a seconds pair.", "This is not the quality adidas normally delivers!! Flimsy material and no real connection from the sole to the actual shoe. I strongly suspect these are cheap fakes. I own about 25 pair of adidas shoes, all great quality. Very disappointed with this product.", "Regarding the shoes, they looked decent in the photo, but when they arrived, they look like prison issue, don't ask how I know !! You cant even tell they are Adidas. With my particular order, the box came smashed, (shipped in envelope) and the right shoe was used !! OOPS Really Basic and Boring", "Very neat looking shoe. The size is just what I hoped they would be because a lot of shoes run small and narrow even though they are labeled medium or average width. I do have to admit adidas does run slightly larger than the average shoe.", "I was very disappointed to find the top of the sneaker the front had a sticker mark on it I tried washing it off with a magic eraser and it is a big stain on the front of these black sneakers why would somebody send them to me I wouldn't buy them like this in the store what makes you think I want to give them as a Christmas gift like this it's damaged merchandise and now I have to go through the trouble to return this product I'm very dissatisfied I don't know how the fit yet because it's going to be a Christmas gift but now I don't want to give it because they are stained up", "Most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn. Looking for another pair right now.", "Very nice looking shoe. Very comfortable. Did not hold up well to water. Separation of toe cap and sole. Tongue stitching was coming loose about 3 weeks in. I will say they were very very comfortable, cloudfoam lives up to the hype, but a more durable and weather resistant shoe could probably suit most needs better. Likely great as a good weather walking around shoe.", "My son has wide feet and most shoes are fairly uncomfortable to him at least until the break in. Wide sizes have never been easy to come by for a child. Now he can wear men's shoes and he absolutely loves these. He said they're the most comfy shoes he's ever had.", "Fantastic sneakers! I wear them to and from work and they are very comfortable. Breatheable and really lightweight. Great buy and fit as expected (though I did try on a pair in store to check the fit). If you need an 8.5, I\u2019d order a 9.", "I had my doubts, but this was the only basketball sneaker I could find in 13W. So far, 5 games in and the sneaker is holding up well. And since others are having trouble with a slippery floor in one gym and I'm not, seems to have a good grip", "Super comfortable with decent ankle support! Basic entry level gym shoe so not expected great longevity here. Wearing during the colder months of the year mostly. If they last me a year I will be truly pleased. But wow the comfort - very nice! Bought a second pair. Will stick with Cloudfoam Adidas from now on - not just another gimmick.", "I only wear them at the gym for weightlifting spinning and aerobic machines. They work very well and are very comfortable. I need high cut sneakers for bad ankles", "Don't buy it.It is not a true Adidas. I've received my order, and it was used sneakers inside, in rugged box and wrapped with unknown paper. Quality of the sneaker top is cheap, and not a leather.", "Great shoes the sole feels great without the need for an insert and have great ankle support. I was looking for a nice pair of shoes and these exceeded my expectations.", "Great shoes for the price. I've been hooping and balling in them since day one. Still can't dunk... but I can't blame the shoes for that! :-P", "How are these only $45? If you have been buying overpriced sneakers, it is time to be realistic. Not only are these serious steal, but they look and feel even better", "I do not play basketball regularly. Since the time I bought these less than a year ago, I have probably played less than 10 times. I started to notice that when I would plant my foot, the rubber sole seemed to move. I then realized that it was because part of the rubber sole was tearing off. See picture.", "The shoes were purchased for my son but we ordered two styles to allow him to try them on and select the best for him. He chose the Nike brand and when we returned the shoes we were charged a restocking fee. Not expecting that for shoes which often require trying on before finally deciding on the right pair.", "The Shoe seems like a Good Shoe however my body size it is hard to match shoes to my Small Frame/Long Feet... I find it hard to find any shoes that do me justice... I have 2 more coming soon hoping for better luck...", "I had the same problem other customers are reporting. The strange design of the sole + poor quality glue means that within a few weeks of indoor play, the soles began to peel right under the balls of my feet. Awkward to move laterally or stop short. In other words, not a safe shoe for basketball. I've been happy with previous Adidas basketball shoes, but I can't buy them again after this experience. I don't know why you'd make a basketball shoe where the sole wasn't one solid piece.", "Great shoe, unlike many nice and wide! I don't know how long it will hold up but the coudfoam is not a gimick. Very comfortable. Also very good price. Will buy again (and again).", "These are nice shoes my daughter loved them and they lasted way better than other brands.", "I was surprised how a $44 shoe would feel this good. I walk 40 minutes a day on my treadmill and the shoes are fine. I did not expect that from a $44 shoe", "My old basketball shoes were falling apart. These are very nice sneakers. They provide good support for several hours a week of hoops. Sometimes wear them all day with no problems. Seem to be wider than standard shoes- but that's okay with me.", "The sole has started to separate at the toe area. I love the comfort of these shoes but the glue is failing. The shoes are 8 months old so the vendor will not replace/refund the shoes. There is literally no wear other than the glue failing.", "Great shoes for that price and I found them comfortable.", "My Husband love his shoes....he said they are very comfortable.", "I love them and a bunch people say wow where did i get them so i told them here the place thank you lee taschner", "I like the shoe, especially the exterior design. However, the same part of the outside sole has came of twice on two pairs. It might be that I put a lot of pressure on that spot, or maybe the bottom part of the shoes is just poorly designed.", "For the price these b ball shoes are amazing feel great and look great too", "Ive had 2 pairs of these previously bought from addidas store. These seem like they're knockoffs.they are much more narrow and the material feels alot cheaper.also the holes for the laces on the top are not lined up.you have to play with the laces to get through the holes properly.", "This shoe is really comfortable. The cloud foam takes a lot of stress off of my legs; however, the sole is segmented and some of the panels came off after a few basketball games. I'd recommend this shoe for everyday use, but I wouldn't buy these for sports.", "I have only used them once so far and can't really complain so far... I'm glad I ordered a size down because it is still a little more roomy than I would have hoped but for 25$ and under 32$ with shipping I can't complain at all... cheap shoes is my goto because I destroy them anyways and depending on how long these last I may go for another pair at some point but we will see.... I strongly recommend for the once in a while basketball player definitely wouldn't last for a daily play but for now they are ok", "I liked them at first, but after a couple months playing the good traction disappeared, felt like the shoe stretched in size and bottom started coming apart. Not worth the money.", "These shoes are extremely comfortable, but even after inserting Dr Scholls on top of the regular sole, it still is a bit wide and I can feel my foot moving slightly. You can only get them so tight. I might have to insert another insert in there to make it more tight.", "Shoes don\u2019t let feet breathe. Material is much cheaper then it shows or they say", "These are really nice shoes. They fit my son as expected, not too small or tight. Good quality, they are really holding up well, and he is definitely not easy on his shoes. Very trendy looking style as well. He likes them a lot.", "I previously bought the adidas isolation pros in the same color. These are MUCH better. Very comfortable. Excellent for indoor and outdoor activities. I have very wide feet. I have to wear 10 1/2 just for my foot to fit. This shoe in 10 1/2 is a perfect fit. I don't have any pain \"breaking in.\" I have bought so many bball shoes. These are undoubtedly the best so far.", "Bought two pair for two grandsons who are eight and ten. They like them and comfortable. Also ata reasonable price. GREAT PRODUCT", "I bought them for my 12 yr old grandson... he wanted a all black pair and I wanted them to look good have the same quality as Nike (which he picked out for $125.00) and look good on his feet for a great price .... I got all the above and some and he liked them as well", "My son loves these shoes for basketball. He is 13 and plays basketball. We got the first pair for the season last year. He loved them. After the season he wore them as his everyday shoes and one year later they have held up and still look great. We reordered a new pair for this season.", "This is my second pair of cloudfoam shoes from Adidas (same as my previous pair, but in a different color). The first pair I purchased was eye-opening in its level of comfort. The soles of these shoes are so soft and supportive. They make you want to walk in them.", "Fantastic! Best value for a good shoe! No pain or time adjusting. The excellent grip of the soles allowed me to work my ankles a lot more than the running shoes I played in would allow.", "Good shoes, but the sides in the photo show the 3 stripes as embossed, but the shoes I have they are painted on (side is smooth to the touch). Embossing looks better - not sure if I got an old version or if it's a newer version that they went to and stopped making them like that.", "Pretty shoes but horrible fit. My son uses an 8 1/2 but that was really too large for him in this shoes. I live in the caribbean so return was out of the question. Had to give it away. Money wasted", "I mean this is the definition of an amazing shoe. Its comfortable, its durable, It looks amazing (picture does not do it justice). I have big feet and they fit great. I wish Adidas would take a page out of this book and make more shoes like this! They shine in this department!", "Only used them a few times for playing basketball... so far so good, they are a little larger than expected. I ordered a 9.5 and I may have been fine with a 9.", "I got a great buy but wish they were cut a little larger", "First online shoe purchase. Fit is great, looks great and many compliments.", "I bought these for my 12 year old son and he loves them. He says that they are super comfortable. After his basketball season was over, he started wearing them as his daily shoes because he likes how they feel. I will buy the same ones next year for next season. Very good buy!", "Most comfortable shoes imaginable. You will want to take long walks. A little soft for basketball but excellent for cross-training at the gym. I got the black with red stripes which look very cool. Normally an 11, I needed an 11.5 in these. Great arch support and roomy in the toe area. It's been hard to want to wear my other shoes since I got them.", "Wonderful foot padding, even better durability. These can last me a year and a half (through snow season) in some harsh weather. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy quality sneakers", "My husband is very happy with these sneakers, said he didn't even have to break them in, they were comfortable right from the start.", "The cloud insole is really nice. I just wish I could keep them clean, but they are white which is what I wanted. Hard to find non-neon shoes anymore.", "My teenager adored these shoes, wore them the entire basketball season & part of the next year - until he outgrew them. No issues at all.", "like this wish i got a half a size smaller but my other pair was 9.5 so i got the same with these but i should have gotten a 9.0", "I am disappointed with the shoes.

The kids complained about it being too tight, although I had already gone a size up (as recommended in other reviews).

They fit her, a little extra room for another pair of socks. They might fit next year, you never know how much a child's foot is going to grow. She can walk in them fine, no tripping.", "Great quality at a good price. My son says they are comfortable and never complains about cold toes. They are waterproof all the way up and you can use the string on top to keep snow out. IF you do get the insides wet, the liner is removeable to dry. And with older boys, the ability to air it out is nice.", "I ordered a size bigger for both of my kids considering the snow socks that would go inside, they are super amazing quality and it comes w a removable insole, easy to put in and out for my 4yr, for my 2 yr still working on that... but over all super satisfied", "Seem to be well made and the fit is great, but they are definitely not waterproof. Our daughter manages to get her feet soaking wet playing in heavy snow and slush.", "I can\u2019t believe these boots! My 7-year old came home from school on the first day of wearing them during recess (in the snow) and the liners along the sole of his feet were soaked! I\u2019m so upset after spending a good chunk of money on what I thought were water proof boots.", "Grandkids had this brand before and it worked out well so I ordered them again, based on our prior experience. They fit well, keep their feet warm, and come up high enough to keep the rain/snow out. My grandson wore them for a season, turned them over to his sister for another season and now she\u2019s outgrown them hence we have re-ordered", "This is our second pair die for my son, love these boots! Warm, dry and easy to put on and take off. Love the height too when using in deep snow.", "Happy with purchase. Seem to be holding up to an active 7 year old in a Wisconsin winter. It's been in deep puddles with spring thaw, piles of snow and slush. The boots do not come home with wet liners thankfully, the outside surface may be wet, but doesn't seem to affect the inside. Appreciate that feature for a kids boot. Also so far happy that the liner has not worn out as they always seem to do. My child is also pleased with non-wet feet after recess. Would consider again when the feet grow.", "We received the boots before a ski trip and while away, I kept asking my son if he had his boots on the right feet. Come to find out while away and trying to wear them, the company made a boot with two left feet. It was somewhat difficult to tell just looking at them but come to find out, they were defective. The fabric of the boot that went up his leg was sewn on another left boot. Needless to say, they have been returned.", "I ordered both the size 6 and size 7 US Big Kids' boots to see which was better. I usually wear a women's 7 or 7 W, but in boys' shoes, a size 5.5. The size 6 boots are a little bit snug with bulky socks on, but the size 7 was too big, and my foot slid around. Went with the size 6, and wore them for a hike in the forest recently. I think the inner pad in the smaller size will mold nicely to my feet after a few wearings.", "Love this make of boot....they last and last (each pair last long enough to be pasted to all three of my children) and keep feet warm and dry through a Wisconsin winter! Could improve their look....lacking in style and good looks, but hardworking", "Easy for my kid to put on himself. Removable liners are a nice bonus. Good quality materials as always with Kamik. This is the 4th or 5th pair we\u2019ve bought for our son through the years and are never disappointed.", "These are the kid boots I keep coming back to. Waterproof, warm, traction and they\u2019ve worked in Alaska and Wyoming. Spendy for us, but they have lasted through 4 pairs of boy feet. Excellent.", "We love Kamik brand of snow boots. My oldest son needed new ones this year and we got these. They are well made and look nice. My youngest son is wearing the Kamik ones my oldest had when he was about 6 or 7 yrs old and they have lots of life left in them.", "Great kid boots for a MN winter. I have had two kids in these for two years, they never complain of cold feet. They play outside for recess almost every day here, and usually after school too. Lots of time in temps between 0 and 30F.", "Can not say enough about these boots and this brand. Great fit and my daughter did not even complain once when we were in New Hampshire in - 10-degree weather. She loves these so much she wears them anytime there is a hint of snow.", "Was so happy to have it in the closet when the first snowfall hit early in November. Kids spent the whole day outside wearing their boots and playing.", "I bought these for my 2nd grade grand-daughter and a pair of pink ones for my 1st grade grand-daughter. They are easy off and on and the toggle closure at the top cinches them in simply and without the need for tying any laces. These are excellent quality boots, very warm, and will keep their feet cozy and dry!", "These are great toddler snow boots. Fit true to see, easy on and off and a handy pull tab at the top to tighten the boot around the leg to decrease the amount of whining you might here if snow or ice were to accidentally find it's way down the boot!", "Our daughter said that the boots squeezed her feet. The liner made her feel uncomfortable", "This is the 4th type of winter boot I have tried for my kids, and so far these have been the best. They were recommended to me by a friend and she said this is the only kind she buys for her kids, so I thought I would give it a try. My kids seem to really like them. Comfortable and warm. Going forward this is the brand I intend to order again.", "I ordered one size up (10) for my 4yo and they were too small, I think it was mostly the width. In desperation of up coming snow I bought her a pair of second hand sorel boots (9) and they fit perfect. But they seemed like really nice boots otherwise", "I liked the boot very much , except it says Girl boot, and really should be advertised as Unisex, as my 10 year old grandson is the one that they were purchased for, nothing that suggest it is a \"GIRL\" THING.", "These boots were absolutely too small! Not just a little but 2 sizes smaller!", "Kid's feet are always warm and dry. Liners are removable but never had to take them out. We ALWAYS buy Kamik boots for our Minnesota winters.", "Bought for grandson who lives in VT. He loves them!", "Good fit. No issues with the cold weather or snow. I\u2019d purchase more when my boys need a bigger size.", "Good boots. Easy to get on and off. Warm and dry.", "Great boot! Warm and waterproof! Kamik always a good buy!!", "I love these boots My daughter loves them too \ud83d\ude0a These boots are super warm and have a removable insulated inside so u can wash them or dry when they get wet inside (my favorite part). The colors are pretty and I totally would buy them again. These are a great buy.", "Kamik boots are the best kids boot for a reasonable price. East to take off and on. They stand up to Buffalo winters.", "Great for snow and just the NY cold weather - insulation can be removed and you have a rain and cold boot. color is prettier than the picture", "Perfect snow boots! We live where there is snow flon the ground for at least 6 months every year. Good snow boots are very important. These are perfect and keep feet dry and warm. They are worn everyday and are very durable as well! Love Kamik!", "My son loves these boots! Drawstring too helps keep the snow from going in their boots.", "I have these for my boys, they are the only boots that can last several seasons and still be passed down to younger brothers. Many other brands fall apart with one season. My boys wear them most every day in the winter.", "Nothing better than a good warm pair of boots. Fits as expected. Keeps the feet dry and warm.", "Great boots that kept our sons feet toasty and warm while out playing in the snow in the Cascade mountains. They fit true to size, keep the wet and cold out and aren\u2019t too heavy. Would buy again!", "Very good and very comfortable as my 4 years voy told me.", "My son LOVES these!!!! So far they have been keeping his feet warm and dry.", "Order these same boots for years different sizes. Love them", "The 4 stays on but leaves room to grow. I ordered this boot for both my boys and they are absolutely in love with the comfort of the insert, and the ease of putting these on, and the warmth. They are withstanding the Mountain snow well in their first week.", "Kamiks are our go-to boot of choice. 5 out of 6 of our kids have them, and when the littlest is big enough next year, she will have them too! They hold up extremely well and have been easy to hand down to our children.", "I bought 4 pairs, 1 for each of my grandkids we had our first snow fall the past 3 days and let me tell you their feet stay toasty warm and dry in these boots.....if you child has a wide foot order a size or 2 larger and thick winter socks so they fit all winter long and into soggy muddy spring thaw!", "Kamik seems to run a little big but don\u2019t get a smaller size then planned. Wool socks offset that difference. So far good, easy for the kids to put on themselves.", "These say girls but they are boys. He loves them, they keep his feet dry and warm. This is our second pair and I will continue buying Kamik!", "Great boots this is third pair I have bought for Kids Easy on and off for younger kids plenty warm for a day out in snow", "My husband only buys our kids kamiks in the winter because they live up to their reputation and seem to last forever....handed down through many children.", "Our daughter wore these through a Maine winter this year and they worked fantastic. They're still in fantastic condition so we plan to hand them down to our younger son, as we bought gender neutral black for this reason. Very excited over their quality!", "My 10 year old daughter loves them. They are solid and warm for Minnesota winters.", "I got 13size for my 5years old son! Little large but i hope this will fits with thick winter socks!", "Bought for my grandson who is really picky and he LOVED them.", "Excellent boot that keeps my kids feet warm and dry!!! The only brand of boots we\u2019ve ever purchased for our kids. They last multiple seasons and can be passed down to younger children.", "Great fit and keep my daughters feet warm. She says she wished they were softer on the inside but overall they work great!", "We buy these boots every year. They are incredibly warm, functional and durable. A bit like Patagonia products, we can always count on handing these down to our younger child when our older son outgrows them. Love Kamik!", "Comfy, no break-in time, waterproof. What more can you ask?", "Tho they are bigger than anticipated I love them. Gonna save for next winter.", "These are narrow at first, but they do stretch out. Absolute ONLY boot ice found that does.not.leak.", "I bought it like new boots, but came without labels and without a box.", "Great boot she loves them and priced right. Came earlier than expected.", "Excellent. My puddle loving, snow pile stomping 2 year old lives in these!", "My son hasn't worn them yet in the snow but so far so good.

Durable, warm and water proof.", "My growing daughter gets a new pair every winter for the past 5 years! Love the insulation and drawstring top to keep out snow.", "Bought a pair for each of my kids.

Warm and have great construction. This is our second pair as the kids of grown. Quality brand.", "He used the boots to go snow tubing and they worked perfectly.", "Unfortunately, they were too small for the son I bought them for.

It's so bad that if I rub a paper towel along the side of the shoe, it will also turn black. Very poor quality, bought just over a month ago for school that started this week, and after one day of wearing they're going to be donated! Might wind up calling Stride Rite directly, to see if I have any recourse.", "DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. PAID $40 FOR THIS PIECE OF JUNK AND THE AMOUNT OF SCUFF MARKS WITHING THE FIRST 2 WEEKS OF SCHOOL ALONE WERE DISGUSTING. I tried shoe polish on it afterwards but to no avail. This is very cheaply made and poor quality. I had to get another pair off Payless for my daughter a month later for half the price. They lasted the balance of the ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR (2 and a half terms) She can probably wear them again this year, but i like her wearing new stuff first day of school. DON'T BUY THIS!!", "In just a few weeks of school and the shoe color is fading and seems as if they have been used for the entire year.", "Four months and toe broke open. Not happy because these aren't inexpensive so they should wear better than that. Also I had to polish often because color fades fast. I won't get these again and I'm disappointed in stride right. This isn't the quality I normally get from them. I don't recommend.", "Like many other reviewers have experienced, the blue Mary Janes fade out very quickly and are overly prone to scuffing. Coupled with unreasonable sole wear, they look trashed after a single week. I'm debating on whether it is worth the hassle of re-dying them a darker color or tracking down navy blue polish, but for $50 I expect a little more.", "The black finish is holding up much better than the blue did last year. The shoe itself holds up well to daily school wear. It's comfortable and secure while dressy enough for her school dresses. Last year we got the blue and most of the finish had come off the toes by the end of the first day...and finding blue shoe polish proved impossible...every order of it just got backordered over and over. We will order black from now. We will order again each year as long as our girls fit in them.", "These are perfect for a school uniform. Our daughter, however is rough on shoes apparently or these don\u2019t hold up that great. One week in and she\u2019s totally scuffed up the front of these. For the price, I would have expected them to hold up better. They do have an adorable style to them, look great upon arrival, and she says they are comfortable. They have an adjustable Velcro as well.", "These shoes need shined, as they are real leather. But our daughter loves the shoes and wears them all the time! The last pair we ordered a little big, but they lasted about a year and a half. She finally scuffed up the front top when playing and we decided to order the same pair again! Kudos to Stride Rite for making shoes that hold up to kids.", "These have only been worn for a few weeks and only Mon through Fri - seriously... Very disappointed that the material does not last... Last school year, this is what her uniform shoes looked like after nine months...!", "These are not as durable as the Sketchers mary janes, but it was the best I could find for my daughter at the time. The leather starts to show wear early, but they hold together well. The soles are better than Sketchers, so that part has lasted the longest....at least until she grew out of them. That is saying a lot, since this kid really tears up shoes by climbing trees and running with the dogs in the mud.....not a girlie-girls, this one!", "As usual, Stride Rite provides an excellent quality shoe, but Amazon provided an even better price! I paid less than $15 for these shoes. These shoes are high quality leather mary-janes with a rubber sole. I purchased them as uniform shoes for school, and they did not disappoint. They have a thick rubber sole to provide comfort and stability, and a supple leather upper to withstand everyday use and roughness to the shoe. The inside has a soft, cushiony lining. I expect these shoes to last through the school year and still be in great shape for my younger child to use as a hand-me down.", "We ordered these for my daughter who has wide feet. She normally wears See Kai Run canvas Mary Jane-style shoes, which are just wide enough, but we were looking for something a little wider. The 1.5W in this shoe is actually quite a bit narrower than the regular 1.5 See Kai Run shoe and much stiffer. My daughter found it too uncomfortable to even try both shoes on. I suggest ordering a double wide if your child has wide feet, or skipping entirely. The length seemed correct.", "Stride rite does not disappoint. This is the second year I purchase these rugged yet adorable shoes for my 6 year old. They allow for running/jumping as well as matching her uniform jumper. Do not be dissuaded by other reviewers about the color fading. These are genuine leather shoes. Good leather shoes need a shoe polish every now and again. My daughters shoes became faded and such, too. With a bit of navy shoe polish they look as good as new... but already comfortable and shaped to her tootsie.", "These are great shoes for my kid to wear all day at school. The bones of the shoe are durable and seem to be comfortable for my six year old. The only negative thing about these shoes...do not expect them to keep their color. After only a week of recess time outside the black rubs off on the toes quite quickly. We had a dark blue pair before and they started to look horrible, as well. The only reason I bought a second pair is because of the comfort it provides my kid, which to me is more important.", "Love these shoes! I got these for my 3 year old to wear to preschool. She loved them so much that they became her go-to shoe for everything! A year later, they barely look like they have any wear and tear. I also love that they come in wide sizes - and it doesn't hurt that they are adorable!!!", "I have been buying this brand and model for my daughter since she was 7 and know She's 12 . This is very wel made pair of shoes and man they are resistant !! I have change them only because her feet grows every year but she barely scratches them after a whole school year . I am very pleased with the brand and model , it's a shame that she has grown up and this brand is only for kids", "Very comfortable shoes and perfect for school uniform. The color will fade in front if teared by the harsh use of kids during recess, but using a navy blue shoe polish will save it easily, as it did for us. My daughter tried different brands and they didn't last longer that this one and were much less comfortable. She always complained on other shoes about the top front that was too tied and she loves these shoes. She even told me that she can run \"super fast\" with them...", "Bought these shoes as part of a school uniform. The shoes cute and comfortable! My daughter has been wearing them for two weeks (not daily) and shares that she likes them because they don\u2019t hurt her feet. The only downside is that the front of the shoe is peeling. It hasn\u2019t happened yet to the other shoes she\u2019s wearing (another brand) so I am not sure if this is a fluke or if they are sensitive to everyday wear and tear. Overall, they look old and it\u2019s been about two weeks of using them, again not daily. Again, they are great shoes for comfort. Durability not so much. This is our first purchase.", "These shoes are adorable. BUT they run somewhat narrow and after seeing how easily the unprotected toe area of the shoe shows wear and literal tears, I couldn't justify keeping them (plus the size I ordered was larger than expected even though I went by our current pairs of Stride Rite shoes). I have learned after four children that in order to get full use of our investment in Stride Rites, it is smart to only order shoes with the rubber toe... Except their suede or nubuck boots. They are pretty durable in the toe area.", "3rd grade, One pair every year.. I order them in November, December every year going up one size... One of my twin girls has a more narrow foot and my other little one has wide.. order accordingly!.. I love these shoes with their school uniforms and they are worn daily. when they become a little scuffed, old school military black shoe dye and shine work wonders, you can shine these up to pass any inspection!", "I have purchased Stride Rite Claire Mary Janes for my daughter for several years. This is a cute, comfortable, and sturdy shoe that she can wear with her school uniform during the week and to church on Sundays. Even with almost daily wear, the only reason that I have to replace her Mary Janes is because her feet have grown. I highly recommend this shoe.", "I have bought these more than few times from Amazon, and definitely there are definitive quality difference between the store bought stride rite and amazon. I do not recommend unless you are getting a deep discount and fine with constantly dying the shoe.", "Purchased these in August (back to school purchase) for my very active five year old. It's December, and they're holding up beautifully. Very sturdy, tough, well-made shoes. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to purchase these, when she outgrows the current ones.", "The 2nd turned out better than the 1st time. My daughter is currently in 12. I purchased a 13 Medium width and she complained that it was snug bith in the front and back. I returned it to get 13 1/2 Wide which is perfect. Hopefully, the leather does not fade as indicated in previous posts!", "This is our 2nd pair of Claires, as my daughter is just outgrowing the last pair. They're very comfortable, as comfortable as sneakers, and my 2nd grade daughter can wear them to school all day, even for PE class where she is required to run laps. The leather is not as durable as on boys dress shoes, though, and gets scuffed up, especially in the sand box, but that may be true for all girls dress shoes; A little polish and they're OK again. And they're velcro, which at size 3, is hard to find in comfy shoes, so they're quick to get on and off.", "These are great Mary Janes for school. Very nice, quality leather that holds upwell over the course of a year though the shoes take a beating. Bought two pairs this time so she can just go from one pair the next. I particuarly like that the shoes have good support and a solid sole. Can't get a better school shoe. Update: Just got two more pairs. She's going to age out of these at Size 5 :(. We will miss them.", "The product fits well as most Stride Rites do, however after a week of wear, the shoes are horribly weathered. She got a pair of uniform shoes from Target too and they have held up better. She does wear them on the play ground, but I\u2019m very disappointed in the quality. If amazon will let me return them I absolutely will.", "Where the strap attaches the sides of the shoe come up so high that they cut into the foot when you affix the strap to the velcro strip. Am hoping they will \"soften\" up with wear so they don't cut into the foot quite so bad.", "Love the shoes. For a size 1 they were slightly small because we bought half size bigger than the normal size, thinking the child would have the beginning of the school year to grow into them, but they fit perfectly right now. We are keeping them because school starts this week but I was surprised about the sizing. If I had known, we would have bought size 1.5. Its still a great shoe, comfortable, and looks durable.", "Bought for my 4 year old for her first pair of school shoes. You can't go wrong with Stride Rite shoes! She has just outgrown all her size 9 shoes and size 10 is still too big. I bought these in an 9.5 and they fit her perfectly with a pair of socks and she has a little room to grow in them too. She loves them, they are comfortable. They are super durable and very well made, and I love the dark colored sole on the shoe - it won't show dirt from the playground easily.", "The only reason I am putting 4 stars instead of 5 is because it gets scratched pretty fast. But the durability of the shoes as such is amazing ! My little one wore it for a years. It did look scratches but she never complained about the shoes bothering her .", "I bought these as my daughter's school shoes. She's in preschool. I love them. They're soft inside and I think comfortable because she has not complained about wearing them and it's been a month. I will definitely purchase another pair when she outgrows her current size.", "Great Quality! Fit as they should, comfy. And she can easily fasten. Look good for school, and dressy too. Versatile. 4/1/2016 Worn almost daily to school, and are also worn as play shoes. She wears them all the time because they don't hurt her feet. As to wear, the soles are intact, no significant wear. The tops look good after a coat of black shoe polish, from time to time, the velcro just needs spiffing up - I use a pin to de-fuzz. These have a good year left in them, but are outgrown, that's why the addendum, I am on here as I just now bought a new pair.", "These shoes were perfect. Needed navy shoes for school uniform policy. These were exactly what I needed. Fit slightly big, and that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to get the full years worth out of the shoe. Easy enough for my daughter to put on herself and are made very well.", "This shoe shows more than normal wear and tear. It is meant for a preschool aged child, which should be more durable than it is. I have had to use shoe polish every week for the past month and the shoe has only been worn for school since August. For the money spent I should not have to use corrective measures.", "My daughter is horribly particular about shoes- and these, she LOVES. She has a pretty wide foot for a 5 1/2 year old and most shoes are too narrow. These shoes are great- I actually bought a second pair. They are sturdy, hold up to her rough play (which most haven't), and she isn't quick to take them off the second she gets home. She puts in a long day (attends private school). Unlike other kindergarten schools, she goes from 8-3 with an after school program until 5:00- so she is in these shoes ALL DAY. Highly recommended!!!", "These are the most solid uniform shoes I was able to find for my first-grade daughter. They didn't quite make it through the whole year before she outgrew them. I tried a different brand to replace them and those scuffed and looked awful within a week. So I'm right back to Stride Rite! These shoes take a lot of use, but they are expensive to replace when your kid outgrows them so fast!", "The best shoes ever. I had first purchased ones that I thought would be good, just a little cheaper - after 1 week they fell apart. I replaced them with these and they not only lasted the entire school year, but a little polish and they look almost like new. I ordered a new pair for this school year. They are the best and well worth the few extra dollars.", "Mine was stollen from my porch but I have had these before and they are well worth the money . You will only need two pairs if your child is ruff .. they are build great .", "MY DAUGHTER SAYS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE BUT I got them for school in September and its October and they look like she been wearing them for years lol smh but in all fairness she does play rough", "Strong enough to withstand the trauma of a very active child! This shoe lasted the entire school year which is pretty impressive.", "Super cute MJs for a young girl. My daughter has super small and slim feet and the size 8 fit OK (with socks). She is 5.5 years old and has almost flat feet so nice to see a little arch support. Not a ton of support but a little plus very durable leather which helped as well.", "These are a great chapel shoe! This is our second pair of stride ride Mary Jane shoes. My 8 year old has very large feet for her age and I am so impressed and thankful that Stride Rite makes well-made shoes in her size. We ordered her usual 5 and they were a little big, but she will grow into them. I love how well made the leather is and how well they have held up in all conditions. Definitely a great purchase if you are needing a nice, comfortable dress show for a girl of any age :)", "These shoes are unfortunately very poorly made. The fit is great. They look great. They didn't last one month of wear. The inside started breaking down, and that's not acceptable for the price paid. Don't waste your money on these shoes.", "Purchased in the same size to replace her current pair which she badly scuffed in the toes. Not the shoes just her tom boy playing. Would purchase again and recommend to others. Had to order the next size up upon receipt. Same impeccable service and packaging. The return was stress free.", "The shoes came right on time, looked exactly as I expected. The box came completely smashed - I usually reuse the boxes to hold the shoes once they're outgrown till the next kid, but this box will have to be tossed because it was in such poor condition. The shoes were not affected.", "These shoes last forever. My daughter wears daily for school. Her school allows only black shoes. A comfortable black pair of shoes is hard to find. They last her the whole school year plus the beginning of the new school year. Just clean and they look like new.", "Bought these for my granddaughter last year and she wore them most of the school year, she attends a private school, so wears them every day. Well, those lasted, and she never had a problem. Hope these do as well, as they are the same as those.", "Love this shoe as it can be worn for a tennis shoe for PE but is also both dressy and casual. Good quality shoe and I believe Is worth the little extra money. It should last. Very pleased with this purchase.", "My daughter can ruin shoes faster than unbroken puppy, but these things seem to be indestructible. Good leather and made to last. They have gone through gym, recess, snow, kick ball...you name it. I will by these for all of her uniform needs.", "These shoes are holding up great after 2 months of almost daily use. They are comfy for my daughter whom has wide feet and true to size. They are not scuffing up on the tip like the black ones do. Possibly because the brown is less obvious. These are basic uniform shoes that any little girl should be comfortable in. I've been getting these for 2 years straight and love how practical they are. Plus they are at least $10 cheaper on Amazon.", "Worth the money! My daughter wears shoes to the ground at school and with her slim ankle these are the only ones that have lasted months and months. Don\u2019t bother buying cheap ones. Stick with Stride Right, you won\u2019t regret.", "I was afraid they would be too stiff and hurt my 6yr olds feet when new but she wore them all day right away and loves them. They are sturdy and great!", "I like the shoe and decided to keep. I know that one the shoe is \"broken in\" it will be fine to wear. However, the leather shoe fit a bit large for size ordered. The blue dye has already faded after less than 10 wears-no water. My daughter complains that the shoe is rubbing her foot a little.", "This shoe is very sturdy and good quality. I have been purchasing this every year for her school uniform. The only reason we get new ones is because they don't fit her anymore. The shoe is still in very good shape after almost a year of use. Love them.", "These shoes are comfortable and good quality for my children\u2019s school shoes. However, I wish they wouldn\u2019t look so worn so quickly. My kids both have these shoes that were bought new in September and already look very worn out on the top. They still fit very well and are good quality so I\u2019m keeping them and would buy them again.", "Very comfortable shoe for my 1st grader. I got these last year for her uniform she needs to wear. So i went with these again this year. The uniform shoes left her heals sore. These are comfortable and no complaints...", "I've been holding on to these for school to start which was this past Tuesday. I took this picture Wednesday night. I can't believe how scuffed they already are on the toes. She's in pre-k with no major activity other than 30 minutes outside....two days!! A little disappointed especially for Stride Rite shoes AND the fact they are $45!", "I buy these quite often as my daughter tends to drag her toes on the ground. Even with that being said, the leather is thick enough that I can add some polish and clean them right up. These are a great choice for school shoes!", "I like the shoes, but already showing some wear after the first day of use. My daughter likes the shoes and calls them her bowling shoes. I found that the shoes seem to fit a little wide, because they will pucker on the sides a little. I like that the shoes are flexible and not stiff. The bottoms have a nice rubber surface which makes these okay for wearing for a few hours a day during play and at school.", "This product was brought for my granddaughter. It fits well and looks great. I been a stride rite customer since I has my kids back in the seventies.", "I was a little worried that these shoes would be harder than the last pair I got for my daughter which were the pedi pedi flex mary janes. But there have been no complaints and they aren't getting scuffed like the last pair. I am pleased.", "Shoes were a gift and I didn't get to see them with the recipient until this week-end. They are too big and the smell of them is terrible. Smells very chemically. Now it seems that I missed the return/refund period by 2 days? I didn't know that was possible? I will be talking to Amazon about allowing these shoes to be returned and putting the charges back on our credit card.", "These shoes are very comfortable and fit the bill for uniform shoes. They last a full school year assuming your child's foot doesn't grow. My daughter will not wear anything else to school. They have made it through snow and rain and dry quickly.", "Soft leather, flexible sole and the size runs true. The strap is Velcro which is easy for little ones to adjust on their own.", "I purchased these Mary Jane shoes to replace a pair that my granddaughter outgrew. They are durable and scuffs can be polished and buffed out of the leather. I will definitely order a larger size when she out grows these. These are a perfect match for her school uniforms.", "These shoes are so cute and so sturdy. The wide size is great and roomy. The only complaint is that even though they are her size, they still pealed the back of her heels. Once broken in they are great and easy to put on and take off. They have held up very we since the start of the school year. The bottoms are not worn there is only minor scuff at the front near the toe area.", "Within the first week of school the color on the front of the shoes had totally warn off. My daughter says they are comfortable but they look awful.", "This shoe did not last at all. The front part is completely torn up. They only lasted about 4 months. I will try and add a photo update. I have purchased from Stride Rite before and haven't had a poor quality shoe before, so not sure what happened here. My daughter wears them in school and does have a 15 minute recess to play outside, but expected a little bit better quality. Then again they were on sale, I paid 23 for them at the time.", "I bought them for my daughter. Her school dress code requirement. She wore it only once. we Like it so far.", "Today was my daughter's first time wearing this shoe. To my surprise I could see white stitching on the inside. I grew up wearing Stride Rite shoes so my expectations where high. I'm truly disappointed.", "I bought these for my daughter to use as school shoes. I recommend if you purchase to buy the next size up", "Bought a a school shoe for my kindergartner. Fits well. Has lasted longer than most other Mary Jane since it stood up to school yard recess games. But like most Mary Jane the life span in finite - they don't usually last the entire school year. I think this likely due to the the test it is out through in the school yard.", "I bought these shoes for my daughter to wear to school with her uniform. The shoes seem comfortable and sturdy enough but the front of the shoes especially is already looking worn and old after only 2 months.", "Great kids school shoes. Kids say they are comfortable and my kids outgrow them before wearing them out.", "These shoes lasted my daughter ALL year! They exceeded my expectations!! I have a very active 4 year old girl. I was expecting to have to get a new pair mid year from wear or from growing. I bought one full size up to start school. The shoes lasted the whole year. They did not fall apart but were definitely worn.", "Excellent shoe for school wearing on Chapel day. Great for a lil kid that can\u2019t tie or buckle shoes", "These shoes are perfect for school uniforms. My daughter has had them for 4 months now, and a little black shoe shine and they're back as new every time. She will probably grow out of them before they get worn out, and that says a lot for a very active 5 year old...", "We have been buying this same shoes in different size for the last two years for my daughter\u2019s school shoes. They are durable and she described them as very comfortable.", "Best school shoe ever. This is the second pair. The first one lasted two school years but don't fit her anymore so gave them to another child and got this pair. Update. 4.5 and 5 are exactly the same shoe. See pictures. Still best shoe ever just watch for size.", "12s were a little large but I decided to keep them because I love the shoe that much it\u2019s well-made and my granddaughter\u2019s foot will grow I ordered a half a size smaller she loves the shoe and so do I", "Stride Rite shoes are our absolute favorite. They are high quality and last until out kids outgrow them. The ability to get these in a wide size makes these an easy choice for parents of kids with chubby feet. I find that stride Rite run a little large, but it's easy to size down a half size to compensate. My only complaint is that these and another pair ordered were shipped together in a flimsy polymailer. The box arrived crushed and basically destroyed and part of the shoe had been bent in. Amazon was very quick to fix the problem.", "Second pair bought for parochial school wear for granddaughter. She request again for current year.", "Strap broken 1 week into wearing. Called company and had to send them pics and proof of purchase. To my surprise the sent out a brand new pair free. Down side took 15 days to get the replacement.", "This is the second pair I've ordered for my five year old daughter. She wears them to school with her uniform every day and loves them! They are comfortable, maintain their shape and color after being broken in, and are easy for her to put on and take off on her own. I'll be ordering another pair when she grows out of these. Excellent shoe!!", "My niece liked the shoe. She said it didn't rub the back and felt good. I'm happy! :)", "Love Stride Rite.. My 26 yr old wore them.. Now my 6 yr old wears them.. Wonderful workmanship and wear like REAL LEATHER, not the fake stuff so many other shoes are manufactured with! Will continue to purchase as she ages and needs shoes for school uniforms.. These are the best!", "These were great for my kindergartner to wear all day at school. She never complained that her feet hurt and they last the whole second half of the year. The only issue is that my daughter loves to play on the ground so the leather on the toes began to fade, but nothing a little black shoe polish couldn't handle. They are cuter on then these pictures show.", "The Good: These shoes fit school dress code, always fit without a break-in period, and do not fall apart before they are outgrown. The Bad: The shoe is not dyed well and the toe does not hold up to Kindergarten recess. Go ahead and throw Tarrago #116 (Deep Brown) shoe polish in your cart. You will likely need to use it every few days.", "it fit as expected my daughter was happy after she tried them on and the price was unbeatable.will buy again.", "It is a good shoe for dresses and school. I like the materials and seems much sturdier construction from Stride Rite (SR). Lately, Stride Rite shoes have been \"falling apart\" before a growth spurt. Being leather, I don't have to worry about the fabric ripping (yes), staining or peeling off as I've witnessed from other SR shoes lately during normal wear. They are accurate for size too.", "These shoes are great! Excellent quality, and have been very comfortable for my daughter. My kindergarten daughter has worn them all year almost daily for school and they are still in great condition- slightly faded, but nothing a little shoe polish can't help. I would expect some fading with 10 months of wear on an active 6 year old. I will be saving these ones for my younger daughter and buying new ones for the older for the new school year. I highly recommend these shoes!", "Lasted all school year. My daughter wore these everyday as part of her uniform. Still in very good condition", "These shoes are really nice. They seem to be made well and my granddaughter loves them and she said they felt good.", "Grand Daughter was over the moon to get a pair of Mary Jane's. Locally they are twice the price and the same doggone shoe. They fit perfect and incredibly well made.", "Still holding strong in the school year but she doesn't wear them everyday.", "For the price of these shoes, I expected them to last a little longer. The front of the shoes are destroyed. Picture included to show the utter waste of money these are. Purchased out of desperation because most stores were sold out of this style. I don\u2019t recommend.", "I love this shoes I have buy it for four years my dauther love them they very comfortable looks great last long 5 stars shoe", "Nice looking and comfortable shoe . You will need a shoe buffer in the color to keep the leather looking good, but that is no big deal. The child can even do and learn to look proper for school.", "Very resistant to the treatments submitted by the child, they were not mistreated with rainwater, if I forgive some color, paint it again, very good shoe for an all-terrain child", "We were looking for white or navy blue shoes for my daughter's school (uniform code). My 4 year old has fairly wide feet and we were having trouble finding shoes that fit right. These are perfect! They are cute, simple, fit the dress code, and - most importantly - they're really comfortable for her. Thanks as always, Stride Rite!", "I thought this shoe might be too plain for a 6 year old but she loves them.", "Cute shoe, too small for my daughter and wasn't a fan of the color it's not a true navy it's more blue/green.", "High Quality shoes. Prompt delivery. I have always bought this brand for my granddaughter and the quality makes them very durable for a child. Highly recommend", "These shoes will be worn every day, so need to be super comfortable......and they are!", "Glad to see that Stride Rite is still making comfortable, traditional shoes for school. My niece, who runs barefoot most of the time, loves them. They look so nice with her school uniform, either a jumper, skort or pants. The style of the sock she wears changes the look for the outfit too, all with the same pair of shoes. Highly recommended by a 6 year old!", "Lovely. Bought this for my daughter, she loved it. It was the perfect fit. Seems strong, she wears it to school. Looks good. I would buy it again if I needed to.", "Daughter complains her feet sweat in these shoes and causes the heels of her socks to get rubbed resulting in fuz balls sticking to the back inside of the shoe. Would not buy again.", "This \"Extra Wide\" shoe was not as wide as hoped. A pair of New Balance Extra Wides is comfortable, but this Stride Rite Extra Wide squeezes my feet like a vise. Mind you, I'm an adult with very hard to fit feet- wide with a high instep. ...When I discovered that the Big Kids extra wide New Balance shoes are comfortable, I had high hopes for these Stride Rites. I will see if they fit my easier-to-fit sister, and if so, give them to her.", "I really like this shoe. Well made. Purchased it too large on accident, but she wears them and likes them. She can get them on by herself and her sister will be able to wear them too. I would imagine you could run three kids through these shoes. I don't know about arch support. She never complains about them.", "My 9 year d daughter has been wearing these as a part of her private school uniform since she was in 1 st grade and they are comfy and hold up well", "Very nice shoe...bought it for my grand daughter for School in Jamaica. Very durable for the rough terrain, good quality leather....can't lose with Stride Rite!", "These shoes are the perfect comfort for my daughter to wear to school. They look and feel great. I bought this as a back up and can't regret it. I'll definitely continue to use this brand for next school year.", "I wasted money by buying cheap shoes and in less than 3 months they are of no use. These are worth the extra spend. I bought them big so she has some wear in them.", "I feel that the shoe wears very easily. Looked old after just a week, though it is actually fine. Now my little one does not want to wear it.", "These shoes are the bomb!!!! I purchased these shoes for my granddaughter to go with her school uniform. She has now worn them for two months without needing any polishing. They are outstanding! No signs of any wear or tear. Her foot has grown from a size 12M to a 13M since school began two months ago. So, I was glad to purchase a used pair on Amazon for $23.06 (\"Used\" mean the shoes have only been tried on, but not worn) instead of the $40 new price, although I would have!", "Bought it some time ago and bought it again. Just great.", "bought second pair of these. First was great, second time I bought these the shoes were worn out after only a week. They look old and dingy. I am going to try it in another color", "great shoe I absolutely love it I actually sing the shoe in the store before I purchase it online only reason is they didn't have my daughter shoe size great shoe good fit nice support I recommend anyone buy", "Great shoes, my daughter has been wearing them everyday as part of her school uniform for the past 2 months. So far they have held up well a few minor scuff but the great thing is they can be polished. She is normally very hard on her school shoes, she had a pair from kohls that I was embarrassed to send her in after a week of wear, so I am super happy with these and expect them to last the rest of the school year.", "Granted my daughter is rough on shoes, but you can barely tell that they were leather shoes. The leather is worn/scratched off 75% of shoes. Usually love stride rites but these were disappointing.", "Fit was good, product was as described and they bridge the gap between the uniform for class and play shoe for gym time.", "Scuffs up easily, velcro doesn\u2019t hold up. I have bought multiple ones and it has nothing to do with this seller, it\u2019s the shoe itself.", "The color is \"off\" and the fabric wore very quickly. Daughter only used them for school because they looked nice with her uniform but had to but new ones two months later. I still have them as \"back-up\" shoes, but they looked weathered.", "As expected, was not disappointed with this purchase. She loves to wear it everyday.", "I bought these shoes January of this year. I tried one show on but it was too big. I put them in her closet to save for this school year and to wait for her foot to grow. Much to my surprise I took both shoes out and the were both right foot shoes. In addition, one was an 11 and one was N 11.5. They are brand new and I can\u2019t use them. I am hoping the seller will exchange them", "I purchased these shoes for my daughter and fit well! They are sturdy and appear comfortable. They look cute with both her school uniform and play clothes. This is actually the second pair of this style I have purchased, when she outgrew the other pair I liked them so much I did not bother changing styles.", "This shoe is very comfortable, I bought them Wide. My daugther has a wide food and it is a problem trying to find her the right shoes. She loves this shoes, they are very comfortable and look great with her school uniform. They don't look bulky at all. I will buy another pair when she outsize her shoes.", "I purchased these for my 5 1/2-year-old (size 11) and it was a perfect fit! She did have to \"break them in\" for the first couple of days, but I think that was mostly due to a new shoe and not the design of this shoe. She is tough on shoes! 2 months in and still going strong. She is a kid playing on the playground and in gym class - so some wear is to be expected. Going to buy another pair for second semester when she grows out of these.", "Defective Workmanship - Shoes fell apart. On August 17, 2016, I purchased these Stirde Rite Claire Uniform shoes for my granddaughter at the beginning of school and the stitching for the top of the shoe has come off leaving a hole on top of the shoe.

I'm not a happy customer!", "Fits true to size a cute shoes to wear with school uniform", "The fit of the shoe was great for my daughter who is extremely picky. However I was very disappointed that after the 1st day they looked like she had been wearing them for the whole school year. I expected more for the brand and the price of the shoe.", "Excellent quality. Sole of shoe is thicker than some and provides adequate support. Fits true to size. Would definitely purchase again", "Maybe I should have bought shoes that were a bit more feminine looking for my daughter. I don't love the style. I'm still glad I bought them. Just not sure I would buy them again. They are doing the job. They seem well made. They fit.", "They fit my daughter well. She's six, and I expect they will need to be replaced sooner rather than later. She's tough on shoes so we shall see. So far so good.", "The shoes are very cute, and comfortable, my daughter love them.", "My third-grader wears these on days that she won't have to do much running at school. She CAN run in these, but her tennis shoes are more comfortable for that purpose.

One last year and another pair this school year. Well worth the price!", "Well made with sturdy leather. I bought a similar pair last Christmas and they lasted my granddaughter almost a year! Easy for her to get on by herself and the velcro band holds up well.", "Although the product came super quick, one of the shoes looks like it was a returned item. It's scuffed and looks worn. The other shoe looks great. Wish I had time to return and get a new pair, but need them soon.", "The shoes very very comfortable. Inside leather lining is very comfortable. The only issue I found is that outside leather absorbs dust and require constant polish, otherwise it will look dull grey (comparing to other leather shoes we have, which looks perfect all the time).", "I bought these for my 12-year-old, and she liked them so much that I bought them for my 8-year-old too. My girls have flat feet, so arch support is really important to me. They're comfortable and sturdy enough to wear all day at school. The shoe's material is very sturdy and doesn't scuff, so it looks good day after day.", "My 8 year old daughter LOVES these school shoes. She has been wearing the same brand and style (Stride Rite Claire Flat) for three years now. Super comfortable! True to fit and size. I paid around $30 on Amazon during a shoe sale - - much cheaper than in the stores!", "I like that they have sturdy construction but the quality of the materials leave much to be desired. My 4 yo has been wearing these for around a 1 1/2 mos and thaey are pealing and faded. The shoes look as though they've been worn every day for one year!! She doesn't even play in them. Definitely didn't get my money's worth, and it's a shame because they're cute and comfy.", "True to size. Nice quality. The black looked much nicer than the navy and wore better. Loves these- 5 pair between 2 kids", "Nice, sturdy, and kiddo approved comfortable. If you polish these, they hold up to the elementary school playground and a child who likes to kick rocks.", "Great catholic school uniform shoes, comfortable and durable with great no slip soles.", "I bought these for my kindergartner's dress school uniform. After one day, the toes are so scuffed that I will have to buy navy shoe polish. We have had lots of black Stride Rite mary janes, and none has scuffed up so quickly as these.", "My daughter has to wear these shoes for school. Of the brands we can choose from, this is by far the best and the price was right. Typically, we can get through a whole school year with these, whereas other brands have completely worn out by mid-year.", "Nice looking shoes but somehow the fit is not right. After just 3 hrs of wearing them my 5 year old had blisters where the shoes rubbed her just under the side of her ankle. Too bad, not sure what to do now. I suggest the Kenneth Cole reaction rock a fly 2 Mary Jane's. They are real leather and super comfortable.", "I bought these for my daughter to wear with her school uniform.

She is tough on shoes and these stood up. I polished them to keep the leather in good shape.", "These are great shoes. I purchased these as school uniforms shoes for my oldest daughter and they really held up. Children can often tear shoes apart but these shoes lasted for several months of EVERY DAY wear. They were comfortable on day one and I never had any complaints.", "These are great shoes; however they seems to run really narrow. I reordered the wide and they fit great. My advice if your child has a narrow foot the medium width (M) will fit great. However, if you have a regular width size foot order the wide.", "Awesome shoes!

Easy to wear for kids and wipe it with a wet towel and they are clean. Great for school wear.", "Very disappointed in quality of this shoe. After just 4 days the top looks horrible. It appears to be thin leather that wears away easily. But after 4 days of wearing they look much older. Very disappointed.", "These are really cute, and my daughter found them comfortable.

In fact, she's outgrown them, but they're still in good shape So I'll probably donate them.", "Comfortable, classic and sturdy - great for the classroom or playground!

She's very rough on shoes and they are not showing signs of it at all after over a month of continuous wear. Work great with school uniforms with the tennis shoe bottom. These are perfect and reasonably priced.", "These are fine, they fit well, and my daughter likes them. I've been spoiled because we've always bought her Keen Maryjanes which wear exceptionally well (but don't come in navy). These are uniform shoes for us and have heavy wear.

Highly recommended for toddlers!", "Got them for my Grandaughter, she has a little growing room and she loves them. She wears an 11 and I ordered an 11.5.

Maybe not quite as up-to-date style-wise for a 10 yr old (this style looks more like for a younger child 5-8 yr old at tops) but still it's a durable and comfortable shoe.

Made well so will stay nice regardless of children's activities.", "my go to every year. I should have just bought all the sizes going up and stocked it...", "Beautiful shoe.

Its Mary Jane-ish style also won the adoration of many female wearers. Even though there were several complaints about the arch support and the strap, they couldn\u2019t outweigh the amount of positive feedback. A considerable number of buyers recommended the Ryka Kailee as great walking footwear for summer. A vast majority of buyers marveled at how comfortable the Ryka Kailee was for long periods of walking, commuting, and running errands Many wearers lauded the shoe\u2019s underfoot support and cushioning The footwear was deemed lightweight by most users It offered a breathable in-shoe experience, according to a good number of reviewers The style of the product endeared a lot of purchasers Several users emphasized the shoe\u2019s roomy toe box as it was able to accommodate bunions The price was generally considered reasonable Some people wished that the Velcro layer on the strap was longer it was not enough to tighten up the fit Several customers griped about the arch support: they found it to be too high and misplaced", "source_documents": ["Better support and cushioning than I would have expected from this type of casual shoe. I can't imagine a serious athlete would consider this a cross-trainer, but it's great for doing a lot of city walking. The toe box feels just a tad longer than my other shoes, but it fits fine. I need a wide toe box and have trouble finding shoes that fit the toe but don't slide off the heal. These worked for me. They look nicer than a traditional athletic shoe. A tad pricey for what they are.", "This sneaker/sandal is a great shoe, comfortable and has some arch support also. I originally ordered a size 10 but sent it back for a 9.5, my usual size. Good width in the toes box, and you can adjust the straps quite a bit. May be a challenge for a narrow footed person to get these shoes tight enough though.", "This shoe is the most comfortable shoe, right out of the box. I have arthritis in the bone right where my big toe bends and I can't stand any shoe putting even the slightest pressure on that point so therefore I have to order a wide width or size up. Kudos for Ryka offering a wide in a totally adorable shoe. Another perk...these make your feet look smaller.", "I have lots of foot issues, and these shoes fit great and are comfortable. My only complaint is they don't last. I've owned other similar shoes for years without having to replace them; these were worn and trashed in about 7 months, and that's with wearing only 2 - 3 hours a day and on weekends. I have the light grey/pink version, and they soil very easily. I tried washing them but it only improved the look slightly. Still, the comfort outweighs the constant replacement issue so I continue to purchase them.", "I usually buy a size 9 m in this type of shoe. This, however, ran small. I have exchanged them and since recieved the 91/2 m which is a much better fit. There is some arch support but not enough for me. I will use my own inserts. I have no problem with the straps--they are long enough for me. The sides of the heels are high on my ankles. They are not padded like the tie versions of cross trainers. They wili require some breaking in.", "These shoes are miraculous! I suffer from footpain from tight tendons and muscles. These shoes are so wonderful that I ordered another color! I am reluctant to take them off! Feel better than my very expensive gym shoes!", "Wanted a comfortable walking shoe that was good to wear with slacks or dress and these fit the bill. I am going to buy a second pair in another color! Love them!", "I bought this shoe in a different color at the end of last summer from a TV shopping channel.

I could go down a size in these. I\u2019m already wearing them so I can\u2019t return them. Also I expected some grey color however these are Army Green. Nice but not what I thought I was getting. I love these shoes I just don\u2019t understand how they can vary so much from color to color. update: after wearing around the house for an hour I realized they wouldn't stay on my feet they were so big. The strap is just way too long. I had to return them.", "The previous Ryka maryjane athletic shoes had an enormous amount of arch support and comfort, but had lacking velcro attachments. This style has little or no support, and my experience is that the ankle feels slightly collapsed. Also, the heel is too low, it could be a quarter or half inch higher. This is not a running shoe, so it need not be so flat. I only wish that Ryka would revert to the previous structure of older models. I don't recommend this shoe.", "Love Ryka shoes. I have a lot of them! Ordered these in coral from QVC. Ordered my regular size of 7M. They are really too short. My toes are right at the tip of the shoe. Good arch support but runs slightly wide too. Great price here on Amazon so I ordered the black in a 7.5M. Fit was better lengthwise but heels slipped up and down. I won't be wearing socks with these so I sent them back. Putting a heel pad in where there's already padding would've been too much. Heel already sticking back out too far. Made shoes look too big. I returned them. Shipped in Prime time. Return was easy.", "Fit is good. Look good. I have a pair in gray and one in black. Very comfortable.", "I wanted a walking shoe that did not look so 'athletic shoe'. It has a nice wide toe box yet narrow enough heel that it doesn't slip. The insole is removable so I could use an orthotic insole instead. Only thing not positive was that the ribbon is not elastic and the velcro closure needs a little extra care to be sure it is lined up. That is a pretty easy adjustment.", "I absolutely love these shoes! This is my 3rd pair -and 3rd Colour! They are so comfortable! Would highly recommend them.", "I love the shoes! Great support, don't require the use of inserts. Sizing is a challenge when ordering online. I have a pink pair in size 7.5 that fit great. I ordered the black pair in the same size and they are too small. I gave them to my daughter who wears a 6.5 or 7 and they fit. I ordered a size up, so we'll see how they fit!", "Mashes down on my toes. Not enough room, unless your toes have been flattened by a truck. LOL! Last year's Kailee model fits much better that this year's new model. Not recommended. Returned them.", "The ball of my foot is wide but my heel is narrow and this shoe fits perfectly. The toe box is roomy and the heel fits snuggly. The straps are not bulky like some that crossover twice but they hold the shoe in place comfortably. The shoes are very cute to wear with either a skirt or pants.", "This is the second time I have purchased the exact shoes. I First bought a returned random pair at Kohls. Then I could not find them in any other store. I Found them on Amazon and ordered 2 pairs. I am on my feet all day and these do not hurt my feet at all. Used to have plantar fasciitis and these shoes did not heal it, but keep it at bay! Love them!", "As usual, Ryka fits! These are comfortable for short periods of time, but after several hours the top of the shoe seems to dig into my foot. Loosening the strap doesn\u2019t help. They are pretty and good for a couple of hours.", "Strap doesn't stay closed. When foot is flexed , strap pops off!!!!", "I really like my Ryka Kailee sneakers because they fit well, have good arch support and are comfortable to walk in all day. I am a older women who needs the extra arch support so this has worked out nicely for me. I would highly recommend them. They also have adjustable straps on the front of sneaker to make your fit more comfortable.", "Very comfortable for someone with a bunion. Love the wide option in all their shoes. I wear an 8 wide in their athletic shoes but had to exchange these for a seven and a half wide. They are still a bit loose.", "I love Ryka . I-have several pair of sandals and boots. These for some reason, did not seem to have the support I usually find. Not for me.", "I have this sneaker in every color now. Wish Ryka would bring it back in new colors. The fit on this one is so much better than the Kailee Palm. The insert is thin and flexible, but with the help of the cross strap gives decent arch support. The foot bed and sole are light, thin and flexible too; not much shock absorption If you have foot issues this would not work for a day of sightseeing. But I can get through the grocery store without my orthotics.", "Love love love these shoes. Bought them in navy as well. I have severe bunions and these are the ONLY shoes that are comfortable to wear all day long with zero issues. They probably could use more arch support for those who need that, but they are perfect for me. I hope the always sell these. I am hoping to find a reasonably priced, no frills winter water proof walking boot by Ryka in 9W also", "I know these are meant to be worn outdoors but I use them as house shoes. They have a roomy toe box which I love and are cool and lightweight. Great value.", "I love these shoes. Bought my first pair at a discount store. They're pretty much the most comfortable shoes I own. So, when I found them on Amazon for a great price, I got a second pair.", "I love these summer shoes and would have given them 5 stars except the Velcro isn\u2019t long enough. I had to sew a piece of Velcro so I could make it tight enough to wear comfortably. I had a bunion and these shoes don\u2019t bother it at all.", "Old fingers don`t do tying shoe laces easy any more so the velcro fasteners work much better and the shoes stay fastened and don`t flip/slip off. YIPEE!!!!", "I bought these when by previous Ryka mules bit the dust. Although these do not have the support that my previous Ryka's had (the previous pair were more like actual athletic shoes), they do the trick. I use them for casual wear, and they are comfortable and I like to have some shoes that I can slip into without the hassle of laces sometimes. Good shoe for the price point.", "I purchased this shoe in the black and I loved it. So comfy for my bad feet. I immediately ordered another post in the navy. IT ARRIVED ALL STRETCHED OUT AS IF IT WAS WORN AND RETURNED. The good news is I returned them and immediately received a refund. So the 5 stars are for the first pair.", "Straps across the top of foot barely reach to other side to attach to Velcro closure.

They are cute and fun.", "Though the toe box fit great and the arch support was good, I had to return to the shoes because it was met for someone with a much larger ankle. Wide do not equate to large ankles always so it would of slipped right off my foot.", "The style of these is a little dressier than typical athletic sneakers, but they are lightweight and comfy enough for all day wear. They would be great for travel especially if a lot of walking was on the agenda.", "I have these in another color - like them very much because they are easy off/on and they are comfortable for walking in the city. I bought the coral color for the spring and summer months. Very cute !!!", "These are pretty but not as sturdy as other Ryka shoes I have. I am looking for a walking shoe but these are not sufficient. I'm undecided if I will return them.", "Strap is not only too short to close, but thin flimsy material.

Perfect for summer!. I'm afraid they're discontinued, that's why I ordered 2 pairs at once.", "The wide is wide and they fit great, but almost no padding under them. Especially hard on ball of foot.", "I bought these shoes to wear at the exercise gym. These shoes are very light and comfortable. I have a narrow foot and was hoping the strap would tighten it enough, however the velcro didn't extend far enough, but I was able to sew the strap so that it is shorter, and they tighten enough now.", "Love these shoes for everyday. I sometimes slip them on, but that has broken the heel support. It doesn\u2019t affect wear, but I\u2019m sure weakens the shoe. Have gotten lots of compliments on them.", "These sneakers fit well and are a nice change from a laced shoe. The only complaint I have is the straps do not have long enough Velcro to make them tighter.", "No support, too narrow, how hard is it for a shoe company to make WIDE SHOES?", "A little too lightweight to do much walking not enough support they do fit nicely as I do enjoy the wide width", "I had never ordered shoes on line, so was a little hesitant. I could find anything similar in the local stores. So I ordered them. I am very pleased as they fit well and are comfortable.", "I REALLY liked this shoe.

I like a little more cushion under foot but after I added my own insert, they are perfect.", "I wonder if those straps are going to last. But they feel really good.", "Ryka really shocked me, quite possibly my favorite pair of walking shoes. Ryka soars over the competition in every category.", "This shoe was just exactly as I had hoped it would be. Comfortable, supportive, cute sneaker alternative to a regular type sneaker.

Fit and comfort right from the start. Definitely would recommend it!", "A very well made sneaker that is pretty! Insert comes out for people with orthotics.", "Love the color pink&grey.very comfortable and easy to slide your foot into and just latch the Velcro.only gave a four star because it runs big in size had to send back.", "The fit seemed nice until I tried to close the strap.

They are a bit difficult to get on initially and feel very tight but I\u2019ve had them on for a couple of hours and they are already stretching a bit. I\u2019m very happy with my boots and glad I bought them.", "I really love the silhouette of classic Clarks desert boot, but I have issues with the thickness of the sole and boots overall. I use insoles in my pair. Initial fit is quite snug/tight bit does stretch over wear. Goes great with skinny pants, has a good casual-classy look. Overall I expected better quality for the price. This may be attributed to the material (purchased oak wood suede). I will be getting beeswax leather for my next purchase. Difference in material may make a difference.", "Ordered my regular size which, as many of the reviews indicated, was too small. Returned and went up a full size, although some recommended only going up a half size, but the full size up seems to fit well. As many have noted, there is no support in these boots, but that has been consistent throughout their existence, so I will use an insert. The suede is really nice and I love the color. They will look great with jeans and khaki's. I can't wait for the rain to stop so I can wear them!", "don't know why more manufacturers don't swap boring outsoles for colorful, like these Clarks. but crepe is picking up every little hair and smudge. otherwise, super comfortable, easy to get them on and off. suede feels super soft next to skin, and no blisters after first wear, so, am already thinking of adding a new color. sweet shoe.", "This is my second pair of these. My first pair lasted almost 10 years. Be aware that the second you bend the tongue back to put them on, the crease in the leather instantly changes the color and makes any wrinkles lighter. I know they will stretch out over time, but initially they are pretty tight.", "I sized up a half size and...wow, REALLY small! I'm not convinced another half size would be big enough either. Too bad, because they're cute shoes. Oh, but the laces... super thin, doubt they'd last ten times before breaking. Almost painful to tie because it was like trying to tie a bow with tiny, thin wire. Returned.", "Ordered my normal boot size and it was sooooo tight on the sides and barely has room in the toes. I think if I went bigger it would\u2019ve been too big in the toe area. I dislike the sole, not comfortable. But the look is nice and versatile", "These are a blast from my past. I wore this style when I was 16 years old, which makes it about 50 years ago. I dress casually most of the time now in my dotage, and thought a pair of these would be a fun addition. I smile every time I look at them. They are comfortable enough (there is no support built into the style) and too cute for words. I love them.", "Finding the right size takes a minute so definitely size up! I normally wear a size 6 but I had to get a 7 and they fit perfectly! They are super comfy shoes and got a lot of compliments on them. Definitely recommend and worth every penny!", "Took 3 separate orders to get these right. 1st pair were good boots, like the style. Received defective pair and emailed company. Sent back defective pair, yet to receive refund. 2nd pair were fine aesthetically but .5 size too large. 3rd pair are correct size and have no defects. Overall I\u2019m happy with the purchase.", "Be prepared to \"break these in\". The leather is stiff around the ankle to begin with and so you need to wear thick socks or leg warmers to protect your skin. However, once broken in, they are very comfortable. Some other shoe has memory foam while this has none, but the crepe rubber sole's shock absorbing ability makes this a comfortable shoe. If you need the arch support, get an insert. Once you break'em you'll love'm. The main thing is these look great and the leather will age to be as soft as butter. I really love them.", "The tongue of these boots is sewed down at the base and will not open out enough for my wife's very high instep. She could not wear them at all. Returned them.", "What I don't understand about this model of shoe is that on two other shoe sales sites the consensus is that one should order 1/2 size smaller than one's regular size, but many of the Amazon reviewers said it was too small in their regular size. I decided to split the difference and ordered what should have been my normal size since I could return if wrong. And it was - per the Amazon reviews it was very tight even though the length was okay (I think - my foot was so squeezed that I didn't fully stand up in the one I got on). I normally wear a medium width - this is definitely less than that.", "Really wanted this shoe to work. I usually wear an 8 but bought an 8 1/2 and a 9 to try as I have read the reviews about fit. If you any degree of an instep, these shoes just don't work. I couldn't even get the 8 1/2 on. and the 9 I could squeeze on (though difficult) but there was too much room in the toe and the laces still dug into my instep. they just need to create these shoe differently. I don't see who it could fit comfortably - i do not have an anomaly high instep.", "The shoes take a lot of breaking in. After reading some of the reviews I thought I would never be able to wear them for more than a day of sitting. But after a few wears they got more relaxed. The soles are still not very supportive, but they look nice and some insoles would make these the perfect shoes! I also want to note, since I didn't see this mentioned in any other review, that the coating they put over the leather deteriorates with use. This works for me, because they feel personalized to my use, but if you want them to stay the same over time then these are not the shoes for you.", "I've had these boots for over a year now, and I love them as much as I did when I first opened the box. They are sturdy, durable, comfortable, and stylish. They are true to color, and although they have gotten a little scuffed over time, this only makes them look better. They fit a little large, but this way I can wear my wool socks to keep my feet warm during these cold months. I wear them all the time and they look great with cuffed jeans, skinny jeans, and with skirts and tights for a more casual dressy look. Highly recommend! They are worth the price.", "I love these boots, I ordered a pair of red but they are coral/pink but still love the color. I bought a half size larger so I could put in my arch support, it's always difficult to find a pair of stylish shoes for an added arch support. They have some heel padding but no arch support which works well for me because I need to put in my own. I put them on and don't want to take them off. I plan to wear them for an upcoming trip to Italy and feel like I can do a lot of walking in these shoes. They are lightweight and cute as can be with my jeans, they don't look klunky.", "I ordered these shoes because of all the great reviews and someone I know loves them. I read and was told that you need to break them in. This is very true! I have worn them a few times just for a few hours to break them in. I love them so far. I am still breaking them in and seem to be struggling with breaking them in in the heel area. The fit is exactly what I expected. I usually wear a 9 and that is what I ordered. The color and texture are as expected. Overall a great shoe! I plan on ordering the leather Desert Boot.", "They are super cute and comfy. I\u2019ve had them a few months and they were tight for the first week or two but are great after breaking them in. I live in the Midwest and they seem to be wearing well so far. I clean any scuffs with an eraser and shoe brush; I also sprayed on some waterproofing stuff.", "I wanted to love these shoes. Like another reviewer said\u2014the quality of these Clarks seem cheap. I am a solid 9 and these were very narrow and uncomfortable. Returning.", "These boots have a design flaw. The tongue is attached mid arch not mid toe box. The laces are tacked in the same place. If you have a high arch you can\u2019t get your foot in. They look sturdy but couldn\u2019t get them on.", "Have had nothing but compliments and people who don't know me have stopped to ask where I bought my Clarks desert boots. The first couple of days I noticed a little tenderness in my ankles but nothing major. Also, I am 5'9\" and wear a size 10. I expected my boots to look gigantic as another reviewer commented about the size. I feel quite differently. I normally wear pointy toed shoes and boots so these actually make my feet look smaller which is always appreciated. We just got some snow and its only October so I'd thrilled to have these for walking in this slushy weather. Will be buying another pair in another color.", "I love these classic shoes. Pairs well with skinny jeans or leggings! Pros: High quality leather and construction. Easily cleaned, just wipe off dirt and use a cleaner. The leather gets softer as you use it. Once they are broken in they become super comfortable. You don't have to baby these shoes, they are tough! Cons: They absolutely need time to break in. Don't buy these and plan to immediately wear them comfortably. Be patient and they'll soften up.", "This shoe is fairly snug, even though I went up a size and a half. After a few wears it has given a little and is semi comfortable now. Overall, I\u2019m still pleased with the shoe. I\u2019ve always wanted a pair and finally got them.", "Just what I was hoping they would look and feel like!! The distressed gray is a brown gray, or a very very very dark taupe. So they'll match gray as well as khaki/beige/brown. A suggestion re: size, though. I usually wear 8.5 or 9M in shoes. I ordered these in 9.5M because (1) I want to put a heel orthotic in them and (2) I want room for thick socks. When I tried them on barefoot, the length was just long enough for me, and the heel/ankle area was just a tad loose. Once I added the orthotic and a thick sock, they fit just right. So definitely go up at least a half size for the length...you'll need it!", "I'm a visual merchandising manager moving 20 plus miles a week on my feet. These boots are a God send. Love Clarks!!!!!!! I also have a narrow foot and they fit secure without rubbing anywhere and feeling like I'm swimming in my footwear. Great purchase. Priced right too.", "Perfect. They're on the smaller size (but I find this to be a consistent thing when it comes to Clarks, especially the desert boots), so make sure you go up half a size! I'm a 7.5 and I went with an 8.", "These were so stiff when I first bought them that I thought I'd made a terrible mistake...but I was DETERMINED not to waste $100 so I set to breaking them in. And it was SO worth it. I can wear these all day with no problems, they fit perfectly, and I get compliments on them all the time. I did order a half size bigger than I normally do as I have wider feet, and while I appreciated it at first, now that they are properly worn in I wish I'd chosen my normal size.", "I wanted to like these - but they were not comfortable at all when I put them on. Stiff and rubbing on places all over my foot. I knew right away that they weren't for me. I have pretty narrow feet - but I also am big on a shoe being immediately comfortable when put on and needing no break in period. These would have caused blisters for sure - not worth it. They look good - so if they fit your foot - you might love them. A little too point toed for me.", "size 9, ordered a 9. It fits but I feel like I should have ordered a 9.5 due to my wider feet... but this size works. The blisters from breaking in such tough leather haven't been the greatest, but the shoes look super cute and I expect the break in period to be over soon.", "I'm between 7.5M and 8M in most shoes and I got size 8 thinking I could put in an insert for more arch support. Like other reviewers said, no arch support for these boots at all. I didn't like the shape of the boots...they looked big on my feet and the rounded toe box look kind of hideous. They were quite heavy, too. I would give them two stars: one for the craftsmanship and the other for the quality materials. Unfortunately, I didn't like them enough to keep them.", "I love desert boots and own three pairs.They are extremely comfortable in the suede and extremely durable in the beeswax leather. The only complaint is that I slip and slide if I am not careful and walk on a moist/slick areas. I have to be careful not to fall in the in the rain if I step on slick surfaces. I thought it was an abnormality with the first pair, but I have had the same problems with subsequent pairs. On another note, the Clarks in the beeswax leather can cut a bit into the upper ankles and chafe. This may be due to the stiffer leather and higher cut of a desert boot.", "Love, love, love them! They fit great, a little stiff but breaking in nicely. I had a pair in my teens during the 70's and always wanted another pair but were hard to find - thank goodness for Amazon where you can find anything and everything!", "They really haven't changed since I wore them in years gone by...which is a very good thing as far as I am concerned. Still very comfortable and durable and look just as cool to me. I do wish they had better arch support so I could wear them longer. Sizing ran a bit large for me on these. Generally, I need a 1/2 size larger in Clarks, these were the exception to that rule.", "Love these boots! They go with pretty much everything. I ordered a size up and they fit perfectly. I'm usually a size 9, and the 10 fit great. The only problem is they aren't all that comfortable to walk in. I ended up getting a professional insert from a specialty shoe store, and that made all the difference!", "These shoes are so comfortable! I sprayed them with a silicone suede protector spray, and they've weathered (heh) the rainiest of Manhattan days without issue, though on certain sidewalk surfaces, they can be quite slippery when wet. Sizing: I took a 10, which is my normal size, and when they first got here, it was a little tight in height around my arches, but they've since loosened, and I'm regretting not sizing down to a 9.5 (or even a 9!) because there's at least an inch of extra length in the combined toe and heel areas.", "After reading reviews I chose to order these boots in my normal size. Unfortunately, they ended up feeling a little loose so I should have ordered at least a half size down. They're not too loose that I can't wear them, but ordering down would have made for the perfect fit. The boots felt comfy the moment I put them on. Some reviews said that it took a while for them to get broken in, but that wasn't the case for me. These are very cute boots and I'm already thinking of ordering another in different color.", "I have wider feet so I wear a half size bigger for all my shoes. These shoes are extremely narrow so beware if you have wide feet. I just did an exchange for an additional half size bigger, I\u2019m not super hopeful though. More to come once I receive those.", "Love the look and construction but these are smaller than expected. Order 1/2 to 1 size larger.", "The shoes look as advertised. When I put them on, they looked more mannish than I expected. I was still willing to give them a try as just a comfortable errand running shoe, but then I discovered that they are very uncomfortable. The cardboard cup at the back of the heel dug in to my achilles, and where the toe box bends as I stepped, the shoe folded rather than bending smoothly, pinching the top of my foot. For being Clarks and for being so ugly, they should've been really comfortable. These shoes are going to sit in the back of my closet until I remember to toss them. Waste of money.", "LOVE the look and feel of the suede, but it's a bit too small and narrow. Returning for 1/2 size larger and we'll see. Will update if a whole size larger is needed.", "These shoes are so great! The shoes are meant to get distressed easily and they really do. Even after wearing them one day at my office job, they looked like I'd had them for a long time. I love military and masculine fashion mixed with feminine pieces on women and these are fantastic. They look great with flowy short dresses and also with skinny jeans. Very comfortable. I normally hate spending this much of shoes but the quality is so great that it's worth the price.", "Honestly one of my favorite pairs of shoes that I own. Super cute, you can dress it up, down, or casual, super comfortable. I didn't have to break in the shoes at all. They were very comfortable when I first started wearing them. Granted I don't ever really have to break into my shoes. The quality of the leather is also amazing.", "Love these boots. They are uncomfortable (very stiff) at first, but get better each time you wear them. Super cute with jeans cuffed at the bottom. They do run a bit small. I wear a 9, but bought a 10 and they're prefect.", "i LOVE LOVE LOVE these little boots! the color, the look; they are just perfect! the leather is hard, so you have to break them in little by little, my they are the \"it\" perfect in every way! I would highly recommend them. i have this style in about five colors, and this one is my favorite now.", "Sent back as soon as they arrived. They are not the size described. Something is off with these. I have four pair of Clark\u2019s and size 9 fits. Some reason these don\u2019t and it\u2019s obvious that the right show is not the same size. Very odd. Seems like a deal but honestly just buy from Clark\u2019s", "Love the product! Tight width wise at first but 30 minutes and they started to loosen up. However the delivery was terrible. The person actually launched it 2 stories over the rail and it hit the wall of my apt!!! Box was demolished. I saw The thing come flying over the rail! Wtf????", "I ORDERED THE NAVY BLUE. SIZE 9. I NORMALLY WEAR A 8 OR 8 1/2. THEY FIT PERFECT. DEFINITELY ORDER 1/2 OR SIZE UP. ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WITH THESE SHOES, IT SCRAPPED MY SKIN IN THE BACK ABOVE MY ANKLE. I HAD ALSO ORDERED THE BROWN BEESWAX IN SIZE 9 AND IT FIT TIGHT. I HAD TO RETURN FOR A SIZE 9 1/2.", "Everyone loves these shoes. They took about three months of wearing for an hour here and there to break in to the point where i can wear them through the whole day without a ton of pain. Much longer than any other shoe in my collection. Worth every minute of the break in period.", "The quality of these shoes is outstanding. They came well packaged as well. I typically wear a 6.5 and sometimes a 7...depending on the make but due to the reviews I bought a 7. They are snug but not uncomfortably so. I don't think I could wear them for hours and as they are leather I hope they will stretch a bit. I will try and update my review after some wear.", "These desert boots are very attractive. However, they are very tight around the toe areas when I tried them on. They're so uncomfortable, I couldn't keep them in the hopes that they'll break in. I think they're better suited for those with more narrow feet. Side note, the pair I received were scuffed at the bottom, so I don't know if they were from a store instead of a warehouse.", "These boots are great and you can\u2019t beat the price for Clark\u2019s! They do tend to run a little smaller, I wear a woman\u2019s 7, my feet aren\u2019t wide but they were a little tight. After breaking them in they fit fine now!", "I could never find my size I ordered them three times always too small so you need to go a bigger size or two sizes bigger", "Liked the shoes; however, they were too large. Tried to exchange them but exchange not allowed for this item. I had to return them and purchase a new set in a smaller size. This did not turn out as expected as I had to pay $20 more for the smaller shoe. Guess I will need to be more diligent and purchase items that I can exchange. Happy with the shoes but unhappy I couldn't exchange them.", "Once I got it, I started to wear it everywhere with everything (dresses, jeans, slacks, legging, etc.) The color is nice but very easy to scratch up, so you can achieve that worn look pretty quickly hahaha. Beeswax was the best option for me since I don't like suede. These shoes are also definitely not \"dainty\", so for women with big feet like me, this isn't the type shoe that will make your feet appear smaller.", "When I first received these boot I realized they were not as padded as my favorite Clark Collection boots. They were also a little stiff. But after the first wear I can tell you the Clarks Original are just as comfortable! I love these boot!", "I have wanted a pair of these for ages, and as soon as I got the Beeswax pair, I knew they were perfect. I will wear them with my everyday jeans and feel dressed for the day. Yet, instead of an 8-1/2, I need a 9. This will allow me to wear them with thicker socks in the Fall.", "Even after reading reviews to size up, normally wearing a size 6 and ordering the 6 1/2, I could still barely get the shoe on. The leather was very stiff and uncomfortable. I\u2019m now in the process of returning.", "These are my favorite pair of boots. They are great for non-wet winters and walking around all day. I walked 10+ miles in these regularly during a four-month stay in Europe, which included time spent in Iceland in November and these shoes were still perfect. The soles can get a little cold after a while, but I layered socks and had no problems. They're cute and go with everything too, even skirts and dresses. Highly recommend!", "I wear a 6.5 or 7. I couldn\u2019t even fit my foot inside the top of the shoe. It was like a kids shoe.", "These fit terrible. No arch support whatsoever. Very flat. Could not even get my feet in them because I have high arches. Not true to size. All my shoes are size 8 and I could not wear these. I sent them back.", "I bought these after reading many reviews, so I went with a half size bigger and the fit is fine. The leather is kinda stiff and tight the first couple of days. I wouldn't say that the arch support is great, but it's adequate for me. I really like the shoes, they look great and feel comfortable now that they've more or less been broken in.", "For the price of $40 they are a very nice color and short time frame tolerable. No arch support and VERY narrow, could hardly get my foot in. Packed them full of paper and they are so so. Won't buy any more.", "These shoes are stylish and well-made, but unfortunately, I couldn't pull them onto my foot for being too small. They run a bit narrow, but I have narrow feet, so this was a pleasant surprise. I have several other pairs of Clarks shoes in 8.5, but save yourself some trouble and order a half-size up. Returning these and buying again in a 9.", "Love the look of these shoes and I was so excited to receive them. I read the reviews first and all said to get the same size shoe you normally wear and I did that. The problem is the seam right where the tongue is sewn in, that part is too narrow, could not get my food in them, had to return.", "This was the most uncomfortable shoe I have tried in a long time. I still have blisters on both feet. Ugh not a good choice.", "These Beeswax leather boots are a very nice dark brown boot but they are pretty stiff compared to the suede ones. They are also sized very small so I would err on ordering a half size bigger than you usually would.", "So it is very uncomfortable with short socks so when you break it in, make sure to wear long ones. I love the look of this shoe, it;s very tom-boyish. I don;t know how long it takes to break them in, but I'm willing to put forth the effort since they are so awesome. Looks better every time you wear them since it's meant to look worn and torn.", "Love these boots! I find the material a bit hard to clean, so only buss these out any once in a while and try to be really careful in them. A great, soft color (peach) which suits it well as the desert boot design seems to be a bit on what some would call the masculine side.", "Beautiful boots! I've already gotten compliments and I've only worn them once! I have a high instep, so I had them stretched. Stretching helped with comfort. The sole is still hard, not a shoes to be worn all day right out of the box!", "The quality is still present but they fit a bit narrow if wore with a medium weight sock. I've had them in the past when they were still made in Europe and they were a truer fit. My only complaint is that the sole absorbs the cold and becomes rock hard with age. These would be great if they had a cushioned insole and a sole that wasnt crape but rather vibram.", "These are my go-to shoes. I'm a middle school teacher so I'm a fan of being comfortable. I wear these all the time. They're great shoes. I do try to touch up the scuff marks every once in awhile, but they still show the wear. Not really a big deal. It gives them character. The size was perfect. I'm a 6.5 and these fits great!", "these are some of the most comfortable shoes i've ever owned! sooo glad i went with clarks. they will last a lifetime and are a great investment. breathable,flexible,durable.the suede is actually kind of scuff resistant. GIVE THEM A WEEK OR TWO TO BREAK IN.Count on a few blisters during that time too,but after that it's SMOOTH sailing. these run true to size for me. i went with the distressed grey 9.5. neutral goes with everything. black skinny jeans, or a nice dark wash denim like. i will wear them with leggings and a skirt too! maybe even invest in some knee high socks! I CANT WAIT FOR FALL!!! clarks are five stars.everything i expected and more.yay!", "Shoes were exactly as described in quality and appearance but the fact that they are extremely narrow was not part of the description.. I would suggest that this fact be included as it made the difference between being able to keep them or return them.", "Extremely tight, I had to remove the lace for it to fit, very unhappy with this.", "I've been looking for a low-profile shoe to wear with skinny jeans and these are perfect. As others have noted there is no arch support and the first time I wore these I had them on for more than 12 hours. I have fallen arches and other issues with my feet so, needless to say, my feet were sore the following day. That hasn't stopped me from wearing my Desert Boots though. I really like them.", "I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 and this specific shoe was only offered in an 8 at a cheaper price, yay! So I looked at other reviews that said to size up a half or whole size and I'm glad I took the gamble and got them a little cheaper! They are a little tight but not too bad. I'm sure once I break them in they'll feel comfy. I love the dark color! These are seriously so cute and I can't wait to wear them around!", "I purchased the dark brown suede Clark's Original and am greatly pleased with my purchase. Classic style, timeless design. The gummy rubbers of the boot make for a comfortable ride. Though a bit snug in the toebox initially,after several wears the fit is near perfect. Great addition to my closet and my newest go-to shoes for everyday wear.", "Wanted to love this but they went back the next day. Very small and uncomfortable right out of the box.Not like the Clarks that I grew up with.", "This is a lot of shoe for me but I like them. They look good with jeans,", "Fit is per usual Clarks, leather is beautiful. Love the boots!", "I am a classic 7.5. I read the reviews and decided to get a half size larger. It was perfect! The 8 was necessary. Beautiful leather and great quality. I'm a snob when it comes to leather and these shoes don't disappoint. I did a two mile walk in them the other day and my feet were very happy.", "Where them with skinny jeans. Just got them in on the 16th of may and got quite a few compliments. I love clarks, I find them vary comfortable I normaly get the leather swede but decided I would get the desert boots in beeswax. Great discussion and I suggest to get leather cleaner just to buff some of the scuffs but made to look worn out :)", "Love the fit don't like how the bottom gets so black after first couple of wears.", "These are beautiful shoes but the break in period was long and agonizing. My friends who have the suede versions have had less of an issue with that. The leather will kind of turn white where it creases when you bend your foot, though I don't think this can be prevented, I'm just bummed about this overall. Love the leather and the color.", "Did start off tight, but was able to break in without too much trouble, now they\u2019re perfect. Would recommend thicker socks to start with to accelerate the breaking in process. Super cute and high quality.", "I love the look of this shoe once broke in a week or so.", "These are really nice boots with the crepe sole I was looking for but they ran small so I had to return them.", "I loveeee my Clarks. It's my first pair and will be buying more. It fits perfectly and looks really great on my feet. Quality is great as well.", "These boots are made for narrow feet. I had to take them to shoe repair shop to get stretch. This was an extra cost. I had to do it twice before the shoe felt comfortable.", "The boots are sitting by my front door so I can take them to the P.O. on Monday for return. They are not at all what I expected. They are hard and uncomfortable, too big in toe area and too tight across the top, plus they look like a man's boot. I am not happy with them at all.", "The wife loved it. Took a few wears before they broke in. After that, she says they're now comfortable. They're true to size, well built and look really good on her.", "I noticed in the description that it said Taupe Distressed/Blue Crepe, but I couldn't notice much blue in the photo. When the boots came, I was surprised to see the entire sole is light blue, as are the eyelets where the laces thread through. The photo is clearly altered to tone down the blue. That said, I am keeping them. The blue sole has grown on me!", "The shoe is great but I am normally a 7.5 and could not even get the shoe on. I feel like they had to be mismarked. Adore the shoe but had to send it back.", "I love these boots. They are super comfortable all day long. The only thing I will say is that because I have high arches, the boots are a bit difficult to slip into -- but once they're on, I'm good to go! I would absolutely buy them again.", "I waited an entire year to buy these boots, hoping they would go on sale at the retail store nearby. They never did! I assume this is because they are a Clark's Classic. I finally ordered these boots at Amazon's fantastic price and LOVE them. I have a wide foot and long toes and had to exchange my 7.5 for an 8 as I could feel my toes right against the front of the shoe. The size 8 is perfect!!! The crepe sole provides a lot of cushion where arch support is lacking, but then I have strong feet and don't mind less support. Definitely condition the leather.", "Classic design and style in a versatile taupe-grey leather. I believe these will last for many years so it's a good thing they never go out of fashion! Comfortable for walking and look better than a sneaker or running shoe. Very pleased with this purchase!", "I am in love with Clark shoes. However, I have paid attention to the reviews before buying to ensure I purchase styles that indicate they \"fit as expected.\" I wear a large size so this is important to me...hate sending things back. I have now purchased 4 pair of varying styles and all have been comfortable from the moment I put them on.", "Very cute. But had to return. Too small and very inflexible leather.", "I wear a 6.5 and ordered a 7 and I'm very disappointing I have to return them because I really liked them otherwise.", "Thes are great! shoes. They fit great and look great too. They arrived in a timely manner and there were no issues with the package. Tried them on and they feel great. Only small issue I have is that they when i'm driving my foot slides back a slight bit and its get numb. Other than they they are great. They're super stylish and go with various types of clothes. I absolutely recommend these shoes.", "This is too small. I would like to return it, I already went ahead and bought a bigger size from you already. Needed it for an event so didn\u2019t bother to return it then wait on you for the other size", "I love these desert boots. I wasn't sure between a 9 and a 9.5 originally. I went with the 9.5 and I'm glad I did. They taking quite a bit of breaking in and it's nice to have a little extra wiggle room. The beeswax leather color is gorgeous, you can tell it will age well. Love them!", "I LOVE these boots. I get complimented on them everywhere I go! They are comfortable, look good with almost everything (I have yet to figure out how to wear my summer dresses with these), and hold up for YEARS.", "The look is great: the beeswax leather & crepe soles are top notch. The size I ordered fits perfectly! They were just what I was looking for, plus they came with a second set of shoestrings in a contrasting, yellow color. Sweet treat!", "These shoes fit as expected, but are just a little wide. They are very durable and are good for walking around. I have had mine for several months and they still look like they are new. I would recommend putting some type of water protectant on them to help preserve the leather. All in all they are a very good pair shoes.", "These have quickly become my favorite shoes. I ordered an 8, and am normally a 7.5 or 8. When I first put them on I was worried they would be too small, but after a few wears they stretched out a bit. If you have wide feet, it might be a good idea to get a half to full size up. The shoes once broken in are AMAZING. Comfortable, easy to wear with everything, my new go-to shoes.", "These shoes are very durable, versatile and comfortable. They last a long time, were a great price on here and can be worn with a ton of different things. Still have them and would purchase again!", "I owned a pair years ago and they were so comfortable, I wore them all the time. With these, I could feel where the insole ended---just below the toes and it was uncomfortable. I also don't remember them being so lacking in support. Anyhow, sadly I ended up returning them.", "Great show. Living in New England I wear them in the snow and when it's dry out side just make sure you treat them with something. Took a puppet weeks of wearing them on and off to break in. It's been almost 2 months and I love them. Favourite pair of shoes. Also good to mention that I have very slender feet and small ankles and they are a great wear.", "Love this boot! But, had to get 1/2 size larger than I normally wear. Consistent 7.5, but had to get an 8. They feel stiff when you first put them on. Walked around in the house wearing them, already feels better. I usually will not fool with \"breaking in\" a shoe, but these are so adorable I'm willing.", "These were nice looking boots. The length was fine but they were way too small over the instep. I have always worn the same size shoe. I could not get my foot past the instep.", "These shoes fit as expected. I am a 38 in european size, 5 in the uk and the 7.5 us fit perfectly. I also love the color (grey) of these shoes. It is exactly as pictured. They are comfortable. I highly recommend this product.", "Really nice shoe boots, think they'll be nice to wear to work in the winter with pants, very soft leather but good thicker sole", "According to other reviews I was afraid to order this pair online as I live outside the USA, but now after receiving them and tried them on I personally declare that THEY R GREAT. I have purchased them in black. My size 8 fits me perfect (and I wear 8 in most of the footwear). Quality is excellent. As to me is that they a bit different from the pic. The toe area is more sort of extended/narrowed a little not squared as shown. But that doesn't bother me at all.", "You need inserts for these boots, they are completely flat inside, no support at all. In fact, it's actually hard at first to tell the left shoe from the right shoe. Buy 1/2 size larger & add some kind of arch support.", "Cool boots, very high quality. Look much better than in the picture. Order half a size up", "Although I have purchased Clark boots in the same size I ordered for these, this particular product was a Chukka Boot, where my other boots are desert boots. The Chukka boots were too small and too narrow, so I returned them. They are very attractive boots, but do not fit me.", "Unfortunately I had to return these boots. Though very cute, it did provide sufficient cushioning to accommodate an arthritic big toe. They would have been very functional for snow/slush season and look good too without being too clunky.", "These boots are classic, and so well made. They were a bit uncomfortable around the ankles the first day, but after a full day of wearing them, they're super comfortable. I wear them with slim jeans and big sweaters, and it's a great look. In fact my super-stylish twelve year old daughter likes them so much, she asked for her own pair for Christmas.", "This shoe is solid. I love the minimalistic vibe that it has. Great price on Amazon too! Thanks!", "Awesome shoes! After reading the reviews I went a half size up, they fit perfectly! I was worried about the break in time, as when I first received them, they were quite stiff. I've only worn them twice, and they are already significantly softer and more flexible! Very comfortable!", "I had been pining for these shoes since I saw them on pinterest a year ago. I read a ton of reviews about sizing; some would say too big, too small, or they fit like a glove. Clarks say to size down as well. Confusing right? I usually wear an 8 but unfortunitely an 8 in these were too large. For a more masculine shoe, I have no desire to have my feet look larger. Maybe try on in person before going through the hassle and worry of what size to get. Cute boot, just didn't fit. I wanted to order a smaller size but its unavaible right now. Pity! I wanted these so bad!", "Initial try on will feel a bit tight but will fit perfectly after a few trial. The size is correct when compared with most shoes.", "The shoes are very stiff, not like my last desert boots which were very soft. I\u2019m hoping over time they soften up.", "Love these boots. Very good quality.and very comfortable. Tip, wear thin socks when wearing them.", "nice and soft, great boots, size is correct, recomend this boots", "I loved the look of the boots and bought them to replace a very old pair that finally died. I got my usual size 6.5, although often I wear a 6. They are too short, my toe hits the end when standing and walking is painful after a bit. I will take them in to be stretched rather than return them because of the expense and time of that process from Canada. I was also disappointed in the colour that is grey, not taupe and nothing like the photograph.", "I have very short toes and I only wear a size seven because I have a high instep. The fitbsmaller than I expected.", "I've wanted a pair of these for awhile and decided to get myself an early Christmas present. When they came in the mail I was thrilled. I tried them on and was so disappointed and immediately ordered a bigger size. They felt small and stiff. After reading the reviews I decided to give them another try. After an hour or so they felt great! I love them! Some said they ran big, but I found them to be a hair too small, but not enough to go up a 1/2 size. Give them a chance!", "I am still breaking them in. They fit as expected but the ankle area rubs a bit even through socks. I am wearing them a little at a time to get them to soften up in that area.", "These are really well made shoes, and suede that doesn't quit. I wear these anywhere during the winter, they're comfy, beautiful, durable. There are few leather companies that create shoes that can last more than a season nowadays.", "I wear mine everyday :D I love it and it doesn't hurt my feet. Fit is okay. I ordered a 7.5 and I normally wear 7-7.5 shoes depending on what kind of shoes I'm wearing.", "Other reviews recommended a size larger and glad I did. Also the \"suede\" is very thin and appears to be glued to rubbery vinyl? The colors I REALLY wantrd were sold out quickly just like last year.", "Compared to my other desert boots suede Clarks, those are much more narrow. I thought they just fit snugly but after a full day at work, I got a blister on my big toe. I guess the leather does not stretch as much as the suede.", "I normally wear a 6.5, so that\u2019s what I ordered... these shoes were so tight and uncomfortable, definatly not worth the price. But if you are going to order them, make sure you get a half size or full size larger than normal.", "Bought as a gift. Fits very narrow up front, while loose around the ankle. Go up half a size to give yourself enough toeroom. Otherwise, great quality and super comfortable. Took 2 days to deliver (outside the US) thru priority delivery.", "Need to be broken in - very stiff, but I am sure they will be fine once I get a chance to wear them a few times!", "The first day I wore them, they rubbed the back of my leg and made it sore. The other brand that I have in this style does not do that.", "Not true to size at all! Too small in every way. Who are they basing these sizes on?!", "It took several days to break them and while breaking them, it was so painful to wear them. But now they fit me so much better and I can wear them for several hours without pain or blisters. I love the fact that these boots are very versatile so you can match with different looks.", "I ordered these in my normal size. They run a little narrow. I have wide feet and they felt a bit tight when I put them on. (I had tried the suede ones in my size at a clark's store and they were comfortable, I think the beeswax leather takes a bit longer to break in) They broke in just fine after about an hour of wearing them around the house. I think they are cute and keep my feet warm.", "These shoes were very narrow across the toe and very loose in the heel. Disappointed. I always wanted a pair of these. Returned..", "for me personally, I needed a half size bigger than my normal size.", "I bought the shoe in a size 7 and it appeared to run small in all aspects including the width and the vamp. I couldn't even get my foot in. Returned.", "They were everything she wanted just the sizing. They fit really tight on the top of her foot. That\u2019s it. Not sure if they all fit this way or not but I\u2019m not sure what to do.", "Gorgeous and great quality but beware if you have a wide foot, maybe order a size up. I'm a 7.5 and the length fits perfectly, while the width feels a bit too tight when wearing these with good quality cotton socks. If you're planning on wearing thick wool or cotton socks think about this", "Iam only putting 5 stars because there are awesome. I do love the leather and color/ style. Buuuuut tomfreaking small I need a m/d I guess lol. Will return", "Ordered the size my girlfriend wears in Vans sneakers, and they fit her perfectly.", "I am normally a size 8, but theses are a bit snug- even with the thinnest of socks. I have received many compliments, and I have used wooden shoe horns to stretch the leather.", "I really like my Clarks! The only issue I have is the height of the boot hits at a weird place, slightly above the ankle, and it's kind of uncomfortable to walk in. I knew that they were sort of an ankle boot, but its just that spot that makes walking a little awkward. But, I really like them a lot so I'm keeping them and assuming that over time, the leather will loosen and they will be more comfortable.", "I wear Clarks Desert Boots for 10 years, but this one has different style and very narrow. I can't even fit my leg inside. By the way i order 1/2 size bigger my usual UK3 so there is something wrong with the newest models i guess ;(", "I just love them. It's been a long time since I had a pair of flat boots that were completely comfortable ALL day that I wear them for several days in a row. They go with almost everything and start to look better and better after the first wear.", "Nice heavy leather, but takes a bit of breaking in. Once broken in, great shoes that will last for years. Well worth the price, which was lower than most overpriced elsewhere.", "I love the look but the fit is too tight. It's not too small as far as the size goes but across the top of the shoe it's tight. The area at of the bottom of the tongue between the stitching is too tight and puts pressure on your foot. I did use a few methods to stretch them and they gave enough to be more comfortable. Probably as I wear them they will become perfect. All that being said, they look great any way you want to wear them.", "It's the first time that I purchased Clarks and I love the shoes, they are so soft and warm for the winter.", "My feet are 8.5. I ordered the 8.5 and they fit perfectly. This is a classic boot. I receive complements all the time from men and women.", "Loved the boots online. Ordered new Beeswax women\u2019s 9.5. Received men\u2019s size 9.5 not in a box and all scuffed up. Returning.", "Just wore my new boots for the first time yesterday. I typically wear between and 8 1/2 or 9 so ordered the 9 to be safe on sizing. They do fit like a nine. Fit is a little sloppy in the heel so the correct sock will be important with this boot. They are just like the boots I used to have when I was in college. The suede is very smooth and the chocolate color is great. Will be perfect for wearing with jeans. Didn't really notice a need for break-in as they start to feel like old favorites soon after putting them on. For the price - nice boot!", "Good shoes. I get comments on them all the time.", "These boots have been around forever. I haven't had a pair in years. I like what I have but the one boot really put a blister on my heel. I'm not sure if the leather sewing was as tight as on the other boot, which did not create a blister. But the more I wear them the better it gets. In spite of this I would buy these again.", "Loved the product! It was a Birthday Gift for a friend...", "These arrived promptly, however, one shoe was perfect and the other looked used. The sole was dark from wear and the leather wrinkled and worn. Returned them.", "These boots are exactly what I wanted. I was looking for something I could wear with skinny or straight leg jeans for a comfy casual look. They fit great for the time I put them on. I have a high arches and usually can't wear shoes that have no arch support but these are fine so far. I think I might just order some for my kids for Christmas!!!", "The first few times wearing the shoes I got blisters on my ankles, but once worn in they fit like a glove. I've worn them for many hours while walking around and have had no issues. Love these shoes and I may consider buying another pair.", "Tight at first. After they're worn a week they stretched out to fit comfortable.", "Clarks are timeless. Love these because they're not a narrow women's cut. Essentially the same boot as the men's, but sized for women.", "I feel like I have stepped into the past wearing these Clark's! Ithey are cushy but not very suportive. Love the color. Rich brown.", "Very well made and beautiful beezwax leather. I have another color in 7.5M, but these were about a size too small, so I need a size 8.", "The Shoe is AWESOME, super high quality! But PLEASE ORDER A SIZE UP! I rolled my eyes when seeing others suggest this and I regret it! HA!", "Too small, don\u2019t fit like my other Clark\u2019s in the same size. Am sending them back.", "Could never wear these shoes in enough so that they were comfortable. I have a high arch on the top of my foot and the shoe didnt have room for that. Also the heel of the shoe is really wide which caused my feet to slip around and gave me bad blisters.", "Left horrible blisters on both my heels and they fit WAY small! Had to return twice!", "They fit fine, although I haven't really broken them in, takes little time, and highly disappointed not made in England anymore of course; BUT not Brazil, Mexico, China or USA, made in Vietnam, not an industry I want to and do not support, so Clarks of England goes on the list to boycott. Clarks of Vietnam. In no time I will forget and I will enjoy them for one year (hopefully) then toss or repurpose and rethink footwear choices because they are somewhat limited. I'm surprised I missed that detail. The irony is the fit is perfect.", "I really love these boots--they have become a staple in my wardrobe. They took a wears to break in and the first time I wore them I got chaffing around the opening. After a few more times with tall socks, these guys are super comfortable with no chaffing or blisters. I walk a mile and a half to work and these boots have held up in the rain, ice, and snow.", "I bought these instead of tennis shoes for my desert walking boots. The length is good. Trying to get my foot into the boot under the tongue stitching was hard. the shoelace broke the 3rd time I tied them so you may as well get a stronger pair to have ready or even just change them out at the beginning so you won't have a blowout somewhere and have to patch it. It only takes a few minutes for the shoes to warm up and start conforming to you foot so don't worry about the stiffness at first fit.", "These were really cute. I tried many pairs of Clarks and 6.5 was a perfect fit and 7 was too big. I needed these in a seven. I didn't reorder because I'm tired of sending Clark's back. I would not recommend buying them online.", "Love the look, but they run narrow with no real support. I certainly didn't expect this from Clarks. They did get a little more comfortable after I wore them for a few hours and hopefully they'll get more so as they break in and are less stiff.", "I am a 91/2 and these were way too large. Size down at least half. Unfortunately, because I got them with an Amazon offer, I returned them and did NOT get all my money back...what a bummer so I could not buy the smaller size for the same price I bought these and even lost 30 $. Be aware of this when you buy with an amazon offer, if you return the item you will not get the money of the offer back so you will loose it! I know they say it somewhere but you will not realize it until you have to return the item.", "THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE AND PRODUCT, I AM AND ALWAYS BEEN A CLARKS KINDA GYAL! I WILL CHECK BACK IN AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF WEAR! XXOXO", "It takes at least 7 days to soften the leather for the shoes to become comfortable.", "I was looking for a grey shoe to wear for winter and this is just what I was looking for. Goes great with lots of clothes and is comfortable.", "I had purchased these before, years ago but this time they are fitting a little small. Not sure if there is a difference in manufacturing but I definitely do not wear them as much as previously.", "These are my favorite shoes. Clarks are an excellent brand, and I have been very pleased with the quality and comfort of their products. I highly recommend these boots - I wear mine almost every single day!", "the 9's are too small the 10's are too big. will need to get them stretched.", "Super cute and lightweight...but treat with stain/water repellant if you plan on wearing them outside the house.", "These are great shoes! They will take a little time to break in, but so worth it. You might want to wear with thick socks and maybe even band aids or some kind of blister tape wrapped around your heel for the first couple of wears (just as a precaution). I did this and had no problem with blistering. They are very durable and cute.", "Nice looking boot. Needs to have some padding on the insole though. Not comfortable if your on your feet for a long time. Quality is great.", "Wide toe comfort, classic style. Perfect boots for jeans or casual pants-completely comfortable from the first time I wore them-I would definitely recommend them", "I bought these for my grandson. We could not fine them anywhere near out home. The price was right and the shoes are wonderful!", "These are very comfortable and stylish. They are true to size and look great with jeans and black pants. LOVE THEM.", "Very stylish, but need several hours of breaking in before you can wear them comfortably.", "The fit was true to size. The quality is great. I saw these in a store in Ottawa selling for $50. More! This was a great deal!", "Fits great. Looks great! Have gotten loads of compliments. Shoes are comfy! They do require some upkeep, if you want to keep them looking fresh!", "I usually wear a size 8 in Clark's These ran small and were too tight. Disappointing. I wasn't even sure an 8 1/2 would fit so didn't even order a bigger side", "I love these NOW At first however they are stiff breaking them in I considered returning them but waited a bit longer and now love them.", "I love these boots! Took about two weeks to break in, and some bulldog puppy chewing :) They are very comfortable and go with anything.", "these go with everything. I only wish I'd caught the wingtip model last year. beeswax finish is perfect. The collar is clean cut so the ankle can feel like it's pressing in at first. Soon as you wear them a second time, it softens around the ankle.", "I would've really liked this shoe. Beautiful, but it runs small. I'm a pretty solid 7.5 and I would've needed an 8.", "These shoes are adorable, they run a little large because they're completely leather-no inner lining. I just wore really thick socks with them and was fine but the leather and thick sock combo made my feet warm. I thought they made my feet look a little large but not terrible. They cute shoes and I'm sure will be more comfortable after I break them in.", "The only thing I would change--not about the boot, but the listing--is to always include the European sizing chart along with US one. I know in US sizes I may wear anywhere from a 6.5 to 7.5, depending on the type of shoe or the brand, but I know a 37 in a Clark is the real deal.", "The shoes were just as described. The color was accurate. These desert boots are not only cute they are also very comfortable. The first time I wore them I got a complement from a stranger. Enjoy!!!", "This is my second pair of these boots - I LOVE them!", "Great boot! My daughter has a pair that shes worn for years.", "It was too large, and also uncomfortable. I need more cushion in a shoe. Still waiting for a comfortable pair of Desert Boots.", "Found them very uncomfotable compared with ones I had years ago...........maybe they would be better in suede. Returned them and am disappointed.", "I have a wide foot and worried about fit but after just a few wearings they were perfect did light hiking and they held up well. The crape soul was grippy and functional even on ice.", "I've always seen these clarks and wanted some. I really never tried them at the stores but just the fact that I could return or exchange for free just made me feel ok by purchasing them online ... They turned out to be just what I wanted. They are a bit narrow at first but the leather stretches a bit making them good for your feet.", "I bought these shoes online and absolutely love them! They fit true to size and the quality can't be beat! I received them only three days after ordering them standard shipping.", "This boots changed my view on desert boots, they fit so well that I have bought more like this, my feet are in heaven!", "walked for two weeks in these shoes, no blisters did not dissapoint, goes well with anything", "The company fail to provide information about sizing, the shoes fit terribly small, I needed them for a special occasion and I was unable to wear them because the size was incorrect, or may I proceed to say that they run small. company must know their products and must advise their customers about sizing and boots running extremely small.", "Love the boots just slightly too large will have to return them", "VERY high quality shoes that I will wear for years to come!", "These exceeded my expectations. The color is beautiful, they go with almost anything I wear, and the quality is top notch. I rarely pay more than $100 for anything I wear, but this was a purchase I do not regret!", "These were exactly as I expected! The only thing that was different was that I normally wear a 6.5 in women's and I had to get a 6.0. Don't worry they stretch out a little bit after use.", "Exactly what I wanted. Very durable and a good price.", "My wife uses these as a spare set of boots at work and really loves them.

I have ordered them for my daughter as a gift and she is delighted with them.Thanks a lot for such excellent products.", "They are great shoes, these seem to run a little small. But when bought a size up, they are fine.", "At first, the shoes were tight, then I wore them for 2 hours with thick socks, now they are perfect. They are very soft and comfortable, I absolutely love them.", "I love these, and only needed a few walks to break them in. They look good with most of the stuff I wear because I got a dark color, and I'm glad I bought them. I do have to add though that around the middle it's kind of tight, but overall they're just what I thought they'd be!", "Totally worth the money. So comfortable. Goes with everything. Modern and cool.", "So glad I splurged and bought these shoes. They are exactly what I was looking for. A comfy, sturdy, true-to-size boot! Wish I had lots of money so I could get them in several different colors! Highly recommend!", "They fit a little snug at first, but over time the leather has stretched and really fits perfectly now!!", "This shoe is beautiful in the box. I read reviews and ordered the size that would allow me to wear a heavy sock. My problem came with the lack of padding and arch support in the bottom of the shoe. Even with the thick sock, there was not enough padding for any comfort. Sadly, I had to return them and resume my search for a chukka boot.", "I love these boots. However, they definitely need a little time to be broken in, so they can stretch. They were pretty tight at first, but after a few wears they are comfortable. I have to wear tall socks with them to keep the back from rubbing against my ankle and chafing it.", "Loved the color....on my feet one boot is far too small the other boot is a bit small...these are not the same quality from back in the day....poor arch support", "I\u2019ve heard how comfortable the dessert boots are for men and wanted to try the women\u2019s version. I read they can be a bit tight, and I\u2019m between a 7.5 and and an 8, so I got the 8. I wore them around home a bit and they seemed fine, so I went out on a 3-mile walk. I ripped them off my feet as soon as I got home. So uncomfortable! They pinched my toes and were starting to leave blisters! I\u2019ll never wear these again, and now that they\u2019ve been outside, I can\u2019t return them. Waste of money.", "These shoes are true to size. I wear them with everything; dresses, skirts, jeans, and pants they're just amazing. You will never get tired of them! trust me", "Love them!! They are so comfortable, have worn them everyday since I got them. I've gotten so many compliments from friends and co-workers.", "The size was true to size so I was glad I had read previous reviews as it was a Christmas Present for my daughter. She loved them.", "I absolutely love these boots. Like any leather, you must break them in, and you absolutely should wear socks that come above the ankle. They are perfect for autumn, and they are durable and comfortable.", "This is my second pair. My old pair lasted 7 years... sure hope this one will to. cant go wrong with Clarks quality", "I love these shoes. I'm typically between an 8.5-9 and went with the 8.5. I actually purchased both sizes and didn't notice a huge difference, so I went with the 8.5. It was a tad snug the first wear, but each subsequent wear has gotten better and better. You can tell that these are well made, and mold to your foot. Would highly recommend.", "I love these. I already have 2 pairs in suede. The leather fits a little tighter than the suede. It requires just a tiny break in period. They look and feel very nice.", "I have bunions and these shoes don't hurt them at all. I bought my real size (10) as they didn't have 10.5 as other buyers suggested to buy. The only downside is that the part where the tongue connects to the shoe is pretty snug.", "The fit is a little tight and they are a bit uncomfortable hopefully they just need broken in.", "My wife loves the shoes but has a hard time getting them on. Once on they are ok going to try and stretch the leather to help with getting them on.", "I absolutely love these boots. the measurements provided are exact. They're warm, rustic and so comfy.", "Love these boots. Super cute and super comfortable. I normally wear a size 10, but I order a size 11 since I tried on my sister's size 10 and they were too narrow and tight. The 11 fits perfectly!", "My size is between 7 and 7.5 Bought size 8 bc I like comfort when wearing boots but my feet couldn't go inside it", "Big LUMP inside shoe in heel area - extremely uncomfortable!! Sent back", "These are as perfect as when I wore them in high school.", "I love these shoes! They make every outfit look trendy. And they're extremely durable.

They're just good shoes all around!", "It bothers me but I'm still in love with my shoes :-)", "I love these boots, they're exactly what I was looking for. So cute.

Also deep dark chocolaty color is lovely.", "If you're searching for comfortable, stylish boots, then look no further! I ordered these and received them several days before the expected delivery date and fell in love as soon as I opened the box. One downside to these shoes is that the back does chafe your heel at first, but they just need breaking in. A pair of thick tall socks and long skinny jeans for the first week or so should remedy that! I HIGHLY recommend these boots and could not be happier with this purchase.", "Original pair too small (i am normally a 7), ordered next size up (8) and while they were tight originally after first wear..... perfect! I wear these shoes all day everyday. Please bring this style to Australia so I can purchase reliably.", "i'm a size 9.5 and the 10 worked best for me!", "After losing my initial pair in the mail, I called customer service and they replaced them at no extra charge and I received them 2 days later.

Better than buying at the clarks store.", "I'm now in the second season for these boots. They really are not comfortable and it is necessary to use sole insets to cushion my feet. They are not great for walking long distances.", "I ordered up half a size and could not even get my foot in the shoe.They run so small! They are really cute, though. I'm disappointed", "I was so disappointed to discover earlier posts advising the instep was quite narrow for a B width were true in my case also.

Would definitely recommend buying these. They come in original packaging and are great for the fall!", "These booties are so comfy. I wear them everyday! I highly recommend!", "Great boots, love the beeswax leather feel and how your natural grooves distresses the shoe. Only thing is the ankles are kind of high and it was cutting into my ankles.

I ordered a 9 W and it felt like a 9 Mens! So I sent those back and got a 7. A few days later those arrive, and imagine my surprise when they are too small. I felt like goldilocks. I finally ordered a size 8 and the fit great. It only took three pairs to figure that out. I guess that's the perils of online shopping. TL;DR: Order a full size smaller than what you normally wear.", "Hoping these loosen up.

Runs just a little bit large but represents a dying breed: the well-constructed shoe made with natural materials.", "If you're trying to find simple leather boots that you can wear with pretty much anything, I highly recommend these.

They fit so well and are very comfortable to wear!!! I will order a brown pair soon!!!", "I bought a pair of these three years ago and they were huge. I kept them and wear them in cold weather with very thick socks. The pair I just ordered is the same size but they're a little snug. I think they'll be ok with thin socks.

They actually go on pretty easily, even with thick socks, but alas, I can't tuck my pants leg in there too. They did become uncomfortable after several hours on my feet, but a pair of over-the-counter orthotics put a stop to that for the most part. You will need to insulate in the snow, but there is plenty of room in the foot area for extra padding. I bought these because I wanted a pair of boots that would be good in both rain and snow, and also look relatively nice, I think they will do.", "I\u2019m a bit concerned after receiving the boots. The main issue is that they aren\u2019t keeping my feet 100% dry and I\u2019ve been wearing the proper socks. The logo on the bottom of the heel is advertised as red but the pair I received has a light blue logo. Also, the box is a bit damaged with certain numbers blacked out.

I needed a short, waterproof boot for my daily stable chores and working on the property. These are perfect! I have only worn them 3 days, but they have kept my feet dry & my socks mud-free. I ordered the shearling inserts, but am unable to use them as it makes the boot a little too tight with my bunion. That's ok, i'm not in a frigid climate, so no shearling is ok.

The only downside is, you better order down and not up. My wife is a 7 1/2 and I originally bought her an 8. Far too big, so I ordered her a 7, much better.

I already have tall black ones and wanted something different. The short boot is a nice height and a little more practical than the tall. The military red is a great deep red color.

Apparently all the orders for these boots are through Amazon but originate from various vendors.", "I usually wear a size 7-7.5 so I decided to order a size 7 in these boots. They fit good but are a little loose, my heal slips when I walk but I think a size 6 would be too small. They are really cute and shiny. I ordered Hunter wool insoles and those help with the slipping and will keep my feet warm in the winter. I would definitely buy them again. I compared these boots to similar Ugg ones and they are comparable and the fit is very similar, I just liked the look of these more because they have the side buckle and Hunter logo in the front.", "Wore these for about 5 hours of manual farm work (shoveling, hauling, spreading) and they were great. Waterproof, thick yet bendy for range of movement. The only thing I'll do differently is wear thicker socks... my pinky toes are a little sore.", "These are very cute and NOT heavy at all like I thought they would be! I wear a 7.5 to an 8, I ordered a 7 -and they fit perfectly. I decided to finally buy good rain boots after going through 4 cheap pairs that all ended up leaking. Very cute but the color is NOT as bright as in photo- a much more muted blue - so i am returning them for a different color but other than that, think they're perfect :)", "Love them. Perfect for the annual fall/winter rain festival in the Pacific Northwest. Since I am 5' 2\", that they hit just below the knee but do not jut up against the knee when I walk is perfect.", "I absolutely LOVE these!

Plus the shiny red color is really pretty!", "More comfortable than I anticipated, I do suggest a sock, even if it is a short bootie otherwise they are difficult to take off. Have worn them 3 times since receiving due to all the spring showers we have had, purchased the short style and they bend easily as I walk. I have purchased similar Hunter rain boots as gifts in the past directly from Hunter and these are original authentic Hunter boots. Came in original hunter box and inserts.", "These absolutely run big.

Returned for size 7's and they fit perfectly.", "As with others reviews, these run a bit large. I wear an 11 in Toms and a 10 in Clark\u2019s, an 8.5 to 9 in Western boots. These fit perfect in a 10 with a full insole. These put the spring in your step! Absolutely amazing comfort and very cute. I have large calves from riding, and no fit issues around the calf area, plenty of room in this shorter model. Wouldn\u2019t be good for working in snow all day, but are warm enough for being out for an hour or two doing chores, etc.", "I normally wear a 7.5 bought a 7 off of other reviews. Fits very well it does seem slightly loose but I believe without that it would be difficult to put on. I also have wide calves that I was worried about but these boots are not tight and don't rub on my calves. They lack the amount of support I'm used to. There is some support but not much for arch support. With my back problems I tend to go for very supportive footwear but I bought these for rainy days and the garden/yard work. So far they havent bothered my back", "I normally wear a size 9 or 9 wide and I ordered these in a 9 and can wear them comfortably with a sock. I have worn them all day and they don't hurt my feet. I actually ordered a second pair. Love them !", "I really like these boots! I own tall hunter boots but they were too cumbersome to take off and put on at work. But these short ones are perfect. They are very comfortable - I walk 30 minutes to work and they don't cause any problems along the way. I will say the blue was a little darker than I expected, but I actually really like that, especially since they are glossy! Highly recommend these boots!", "Be sure you check the size before you buy! The first pair I bought were a size 5...a mistake on my part because I didn't recheck my order before I placed it....bummer. The second pair I ordered were just right! Perfect, true to size! I have the tall gray ones as well. I like these better because they aren't too tight on my calves like the gray ones. These sit right at the beginning of the calf so they are Perfect. They're cute AND they keep the water off of my tootsies.", "I wear a size 9.5, and the size 9 was big on my foot - even though Amazon\u2019s size guide had suggested I actually order the size 10. Glad I read other reviews and ordered the size down! Unfortunately, as someone with wide calves these boots are goth at the top. I would not recommend these for people with wide legs. Otherwise, they loook like nice boots.", "Better than expected. So cute and stylish. The gloss finish is spot on. So glad I got the gloss rather than the matte finished! Love my first Hunter boots, since I\u2019ve been waiting to get them. Normally wear a size 7, purchased a size 6 and they are perfect. Even if I put on socks, still have enough wiggle room for comfort. Going to NYC for the weekend and projected rain in the picture, so can\u2019t wait to wear them.", "Perfect fit. Go with your normal size. They do cause your feet to be cold on cool days but I Love being cold. Thick socks, I\u2019ve been told, fixes the cold feet issue.", "Do not buy. Buyer beware. They charged a restocking fee for boots I returned because they were all scrapped up. They are not honorary prime free returns.", "Love these but I wish they would fix how the buckle lays. Looks kind of silly because the buckle is bunched up. Don\u2019t get why it\u2019s designed that way?", "Just like all the other reviews say you should size down one for these so if you wear a size 7 you should get a size 6 for yourself! I do thoroughly enjoy these, I do have a thicker calf and I had no problem with them! They are super super cute and very very trendy I would highly recommend!!", "I wear 8.5 and have high arches so I have trouble with boots cutting me across the top of my foot. These are very roomy so no issues. I bought an 8 and it's plenty long. While these don't come over your calf, they will come up to them. My calves are almost 17\" around and these are just slightly roomy enough that they don't squeeze the base of my calf. However, if you have larger calves than mine, I wouldn't get them.", "I love these boots! I have big calves, always hard to find boots and these were a little snug at first on my calves but after wearing them once or twice they loosened up a bit. I wear them with everything and I swear to god I never put stinky feet in them and I never WILL put stinky feet in them. I love these boots! They are heavier than most boots but they are just great quality. It takes a while for my toes to get cold in them and I use them in the winter.", "I wear 8 - 8.5. theses are an 8 and are big enough to put on a pair of bulky socks. Very comfortable and cute. this was the cheapest I found them!", "I read reviews and ordered a whole size smaller. My usual 9 foot and the 8 fits excellent. Cane quickly and boxed well. Recommend this seller!", "Glad I didn\u2019t size down or up as some reviews suggested, I purchased my normal size 8 in the violet, and they fit comfortably. I\u2019m planning on ordering the knit hunter liners for the colder Maine weather. They\u2019re perfect.", "I received these boots today and I love them. The violet color is my favorite. I have the black gloss from a department store and these are the same quality. I normally wear 8 1/2 in all my other brands of boots but I have my Hunter Boots in size 8 and they fit perfectly. I\u2019d go closest whole number down if you\u2019re a half size like me. Enough room for me to wear thick socks if needed and they\u2019re very comfortable. Can\u2019t get over how gorgeous the color is!", "I have wide calves and was nervous about ordering these but they fit perfectly. Not loose with jeans tucked in but not too snug at all. I do wish I'd ordered down a size instead of up since I'm an 8 1/2 but with thick socks they'll be perfect. Can't wait for another rainy day!", "I am not sure why everyone is saying the boots run large. Maybe I got a fake? I wear size 8.5, ordered 8 and could barely squeeze in. I wanted to wear the boots with Hunters winter inserts and I doubt I'll even fit into size 9 with socks. I ordered size 10 and they fit just right with the Hunters winter insert. A bit roomy but I wouldn't want them smaller.", "I\u2019ve wanted a pair of Hunters for years, but I had to return them. The foot of the boots fit well, but the calf was very wide. In addition to looking weird, the top of the boots alternately smacked the front and back of my legs as I walked. Bummer. I\u2019m giving them three stars because they looked and felt well made. Maybe a taller pair would work better for me.", "I purchased these boots two years ago almost to the day And they are all cracked. If you look on the manufacturers website they offer a two year warranty however it appears that this is not an authorized seller of the boots therefore the warranty is Null and void and you are out of luck if you have any issues with the product. These were expensive boots and I would have expected that they lasted longer than they did after barely even wearing them. If you want Hunter boots, order directly through their website - not Amazon.", "Couldn't wait to finally get a pair of Hunter boots!! Arrived in a box with enough stickers on it to show that they had been previously returned a few times. I ordered the gloss and there were prints and gunk all over them! They were made in China and were no where the quality they used to be. Sorry Hunter won't be ordering any others!!", "Love these boots. I like the extra toe room (fits more like a tennis show with the wider toe and more expected size arch & heel). They are heavy and substantial. I plan on wearing them out in my garden when spring gets here, and they have plenty of traction for it. I am shorter, so I bought the mid-height boot.

The calf and shaft is perfect for me and I cannot wait for it to rain so I can show them off. So happy that I could find dark midnight navy color Hunter Boots. You can wear nice thick socks with them too. Want to buy pink ones too when they are back in stock. Very comfortable. I would recommend them.", "Definitely size down one full size. I am usually a size 10 and I ordered a women's 9 and they fit perfectly, even with thick socks. Great boots!", "I already had a pair of these boots in red and wanted another pair in black.

The boots themselves are wonderful, and I get lots of compliments, especially when I wear the ribbed Hunter socks.", "These boots are so heavy. I wear a size 7 & the boots fit like an extra wide 8. I do have tall Hunters & they run true. Not sure why these are defective. Also, after 2 wearings, the top started fraying. It\u2019s difficult to drive in these. The shaft circumference is also HUGE made for extra-width ankles/calves. Terrible. I will be giving them away to someone who has giant feet and legs.", "I love these but they run about 1/2 size bigger. I wear a 7 1/2 and I ordered a 7. There's plenty of room.", "Obviously this is one of the most fashionable and popular boots out there. I struggled with the size a bit and the Hunter site was very helpful. I measured my foot according to their specifications and the fit is perfect. Can\u2019t wait to wear them.", "Great rain boot, very tolerable to wear during the day. Ofcourse you aren't getting the support and comforts from a tennis shoe, but it is not uncomfortable at all. The height is perfect allowing for an easy on easy off experience.", "This is clearly a true Hunter product. It is very water proof and wonderfully sturdy. However, I got the calf length ones due to larger calves, and they cut me in a weird place. I love them so much I still qear them!", "These boots are absolutely adorable. Unfortunately they were too small. I also found them to be very rigid which was uncomfortable and hard to walk in. I had to return them.", "Hunter boots won\u2019t let you down. I purchased these for my daughter to use walking to class in college and she is well satisfied with the support, comfort and keeping her feet dry. She liked them so much I purchased a pair for myself. She was right, they are a great boot.", "I was hoping the shorter boots would fit my calves better and these do fit and I can wear tall socks with them but I can't tuck my pants in them. They are very comfortable, more than I expected and not too hard to put on or take off considering the kind of boot they are. Overall I am happy, especially for the price.", "I ordered these boots for my daughter who wears a 6.5. The US 7's fit perfectly with a little room to grow. I will say that these boots are BLACK, even thought the box says \"Dark Slate\". We ordered a \"Dark Slate\" in the size 6 and those were a dark gray, and not black like these. We had to return the 6's because they didn't fit. She says she likes the black better but I think she just wanted to keep them. Not sure why the colors were different. I wish I had taken a picture of them side by side but I had already packed up the others to return.", "I am an 8.5 normally but I order these in a 9 and they fit perfect even though offer no arch support at all. But hey, they are rain boots so they definitely do their job. Plus I get compliments every time I wear them! I did end up ordering a pair of hunter socks and that makes wearing the boot much more bearable for an extended period of time.", "LOVE LOVE LOVE my bright yellow boots! I get so many compliments on them everywhere I go! Shipping was right on time and they arrived in the original Hunter box and packaging. I can\u2019t wait to order more colors!", "I love these boots. I read reviews by their customers recommending people with half sizes to go down in size, not so in my case. I ordered the size up and am extremely happy I did. With the boot socks, it fit perfectly, almost a little snug. So I can imagine how disappointed I would have been had I ordered a size down. They are great keeping snow and water out. Not a boot for extreme snow play but they didn\u2019t recommend them for that type of activity. It is the perfect boot for what I wanted. I would definitely recommend these.", "I love how these boots look and they have held up great so far. however, they do seem to run big and they are very hard to walk in if i dont wear very thick socks or the hunter winter sock liners. Other than that i love them. I think a half size smaller would be perfect", "I thought I was getting a matte green boot as pictured, but it was definitely glossy. Pretty heavy for a mud boot, and there is absolutely no support, got huge blisters on my heals after a 10 minute walk.", "The army red is much darker than the picture, like a dirty emerald red or maroon. Disappointed. Quality seemed great. I'm more like 10.5 woman's so I got the 10 it seemed like a very about fit, but I didn't actually wear them.", "These boots are EXACTLY what I wanted! The regular ones are too tall for my short legs. I knew they were rumored to be slightly large and that\u2019s perfect for wearing winter socks with. I love the color, the fit, the look...everything.", "Love my orange boots! Perfect shade of orange. I have a slightly wider foot (I don't buy shoes in wide, but Converse aren't super comfortable for me..?) I ordered my normal shoes size of 7. They fit perfectly. I love them. They are comfortable and cute.", "I was very hesitant to buy these from Amazon but after receiving them I was pleasantly surprised. They came neatly packaged in a hunter box. They are exactly as described. I am very happy I will definitely be ordering more!", "I originally purchased the tall version of these boots but I am only 5\u20195\u201d and have large calves so decided to return them and buy these. I LOVE THEM. I am excited to actually wear them in the rain/snow. I typically wear a size 8.5-9 in normal shoes but ordered these in a size 8 and they fit perfect even with a pair of socks on. They came in an authentic seeming Hunter box/packaging. I am a happy camper!", "I originally ordered a size 8, my shoe size, from a different retailer. I have a skinny foot/leg, and the boot was big and bulky on me and so I returned. I bought a size 7, which my foot is normally too big for- but the boots fit nice. If you have a skinny foot/leg I\u2019d recommend going a size down, and if you\u2019re a half size, go down rather than up as these do run large! But really like the quality. They are so cute!", "Love the fit. Love the comfort. LOVE ALL THE COMPLIMENTS I GET!!! I have trouble finding boots that fit over my calf\u2019s. I bought the size I normally get in shoes and they were a PERFECT fit!", "I am getting a lot of use out of these bootstrap.... they look so good that I don\u2019t wait for a rain day to wear them! The navy shirt socks roll over the top and show off the Hunter label also!", "I had read reviews that these run big, but thankfully I ordered my normal size. I wear an 8.5 to 9 and ordered the 9s which fit perfectly. The boots do squeak when I walk on hard surfaces, I am hoping that goes away.", "Love the color, look and style of these. I feel safe walking on snow. Purchases the Hunter boot sock which works well using these as winter boots. I feel a bit of slippage as I walk but I attribute that to the boot construction\u2014it is not made to mold to the foot and I like the roominess.", "I expected them to be a little truer in color to the photograph...these are more maroon than candy apple red like I was hoping. Huge Georgia fan, it\u2019s hard to wear these bama looking boots..", "These are FABULOUS! I've wanted a pair for years, and after a particularly rainy/icky spring in Boston I finally splurged on them and I couldn't be happier. I got the glossy red color (which is a bit bold for me, to be honest) but I get compliments everywhere I go. I was worried they would be uncomfortable because they're rubber, but they're SO comfy. I'm thrilled.", "These are okay. I am a size 7 and feel the size is a bit loose but not worth the back and forth of trying a new size. Wearing thick socks is a must to prevent blisters, had I known that I would have ordered something else for gardening. They are also kind of hard to get off despite being loose. I like the glossy red and it cleans easily.", "Great boots... Definitely too small! I\u2019m a true 7.5 and I bought a 7 because the reviews said size down... do not! I ordered an 8 and they\u2019re perfect, can be worn with regular socks and room to wear with the Hunter fleece liners.", "The boots ordered were darker blue than I expected - However, I liked the color anyway. The fit was tighter than my old hunters of same size and style. Hopefully, they will loosen up after wearing for awhile.", "I have wide feet and found these rainboots to be very comfortable. They don't make my feet sweat. I liked them so much, I ordered a second pair in matte black.", "These aren\u2019t boots that run large. Don\u2019t believe that, its not true. I\u2019m an 11 in most shoes, so these fit nice as a 10 and they were wide enough. They have no room though...they aren\u2019t loose, they fit with socks but there is very little wiggle room. I have a wide foot.", "Love the fit and style. Perfect for keeping your feet dry. Even better with the short, Hunter boot socks...while these are not snowboots, the addition of the socks, will keep your feet dry and warm.", "Gorgeous and completely legit! I was worried they would be some kind of knock off for the price but they\u2019re the real deal! I love them!!", "Love my Short slate grey Hunter boots ! I am a side 10 and ordered a size down. Size 9 fit perfect with a thick sock. I am so happy I got the short ones .. love them !! Should have had these months ago with all the rain we have had in Maryland", "I bought these for muddy and snowy terrain wheeling my Jeep. They are perfect. Rise down easy and with sock inserts convert into a winter boot capable of moving through a foot of snow with getting my pants wet. I have used them a ton and I'm in love.", "Love these mother effers! Since it doesn\u2019t rain often in Los Angeles, I stomped in all the puddles like a mofo!!! My feet wet completely dry. Fit great. And I got lots of compliments on my hot red shiny boots. I even bought a pink pair!", "I like the boots themselves. But I didn't realize until I'd worn them outside that they sent over the wrong size. I figured they were kinda snug because they are new shoes initially. If I hadn't worn them outdoors already, I would return them.", "If you\u2019re a 1/2 size, go with the smaller size. I\u2019m an 8 1/2... ordered an 8, and they are perfect. Even with thicker socks, the smaller 8 fits fine. If I had gone up to a 9 they would have been too big.", "wish they would have stated they ran large and would have ordered a whole size smaller. Have never worn because they are a full size larger even with thick socks. In the back of my closet. Maybe my feet will grow!!!!!!", "I have very muscular calves & these fit great! Ordered my normal size. So fun & cute in the teal color! Very high quality!", "The boots were authentic and the price was awesome, so I'm happy. You really can't go wrong with Hunter boots and the red is just adorable, so I would recommend them. But remember, Hunter boots run small, so size down (i.e., I wear an 8 1/2 in shoes and I purchased an 8).", "These are the real deal and of quality - I wear a size 10 and boots fit perfectly with space to wear socks -", "Hunter rain boots are the best. Bought these to replace my last pair which I have had for over 10 years and just noticed a little hole in the heal. Can be worn all year, but if you are primarily using in snow, you need the warm boot liners and might go up half a size.", "I always wear a size 10... but they were too big so I had to order a size 9. Size 9 fits great!", "Initially bought a less expensive brand, which I returned -- too difficult getting them off with my high in-step. No such problem with these. Size is as expected -- can wear with thin or thicker sock.", "I had heard that it rains most of the year in the state of Washington. I had to relocate to Washington for a job 3 months ago and found that it literally rains every day. To avoid walking around in soggy shoes, I purchased these Hunter boots. They are as cute as they can be. In addition they\u2019re completely functional. So now I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s raining or not, I love wearing my new boots.", "I scored a great price on these boots. They were my size and the color I was looking for....", "These are great boots that I waited a long time to order. I love them and they fit TTS. I have a very high arch so I ordered one size up to accommodate for it and it worked perfectly.", "Haven\u2019t really had much opportunity to wear these yet. They fit great, look nice and they will get plenty of use during the rainy season.", "These are great. I\u2019m glad I\u2019d read the reviews about sizing. I typically wear a 7 1/2 so I ordered the 7. They fit perfect!", "I bought these as a Christmas present for my wife. I\u2019ve heard only good things from her on these boots and she wears the often.", "Love these boots!! They fit great! I get a ton of compliments when I wear them! Not advisable for wide calf\u2019s.", "the top rim of the boots scrapes the skin on my calves. I would have to get the boot socks to cover it and it's not worth it because it's too hot to have the socks in the summer.", "Purchased these for my little cousin who attends Ball State, she says it rains a lot there and needed some food quality boots. Since I own a pair, I decided to get her a pair. She loves them.", "Perfect rain boots for spring in Maine! Durable, some space so if I have to wear thicker socks, but not too loose so they are too big!", "Oh my goodness! These boots are adorable! Love the shiny yellow color- adds sunshine to a gloomy day. I wear size 7.5 and I ordered the 8. A little roomy but will work well with winter socks.", "Beautiful boots, not a cherry red like the picture though, more or a muted red. Still very pleased with the quality.", "I love these boots. They are so beautiful and do their job. I am a size seven but ordered a size six due to other reviews stating it runs large; glad I went a size down, they fit perfect", "Can't really size down. Rain boots are meant to be loose. Normally wear 9 ordered 9. Loose but toes are where they should be.", "they look great and the price was better than anyplace else. they aren't knock-offs.", "My daughter wanted glossy yellow short Hunter boots. The description says the boots are glossy, but they are not. I kept them to put under the Christmas tree. She likes them. I would recommend correcting the description.", "Made an impulse purchase on these red Hunters and i have NO regrets! Love the color, and the quality is great. Came packaged in an authentic Hunters box, the box was bent a bit, but that happens with shipping. Well worth the $$$! Glad i went this route instead of paying the original $140 on Hunter website! I typically wear a 7.5/8 and i went with size 7 and it fits perfect, even with thick boot socks!", "I LOVE these boots. I wear an 8.5 and ordered the 8. They fit perfect! Enough room to wear socks. Very, very comfortable! I\u2019m happy I opted to buy these instead of a different brand. WELL worth the money!!", "Love the boots! I wear size 6 and I got the boots size 6 but they seems to be a little bit bigger than regular size. Maybe cause there rubber boots. But great long lasting and great price compared to retail stores", "My boots came quickly and fit perfect... seen sum reviews say they run big but I ordered a 10m and that\u2019s my original size.. and they fit nice...will be ordering more in different colors\u2665\ufe0f", "I got these for my daughter's birthday and she loved them. The color is just as it looks, the fit was just as it should be, and the quality was very good. They work well with thick socks to keep your feet warm and dry while watching the kid's soccer or football games in this cooler weather.", "These boots run a tad bit large so if you are a 1/2 size order down not up. For instance I wear a 7.5 and should have ordered a 7 but I ordered size 8.", "I have a pair of Hunter boots I bought 6 years ago and I love them. I was so excited to order another pair in the red color. I was disappointed when they came, however. The red color was more of an orange red and the picture on line looked more like fire engine red. I love the boots themselves but will be returning them due to the color.", "Love the Hunter brand and these boots. The calf height is ideal and the dark slate color is a nice but subtle change from black rain boots.", "Beautiful! They fit like a glove with room for thicker socks. Im really crossing my fingers and hoping they dont split or crack like the others Ive seen in reviews. So far so good!", "I'm very torn on these. Ive worn them a few times and they do great while its raining but they're insanely heavy. I've worn them to work twice while it was raining outside and the second time I learned to take a 2nd pair of shoes to work to swap out. They do they're job for sure but it's definitely not an \"all day\" shoe.", "if you have wide calf\u2019s, these rain boots are perfect fit. The height of the boot fits just right around the calf and on the foot. Color is bright and boots are comfortable.", "Very happy with my purchase of these authentic Hunter short red boots. They are practical, cute and fun to wear! Great price and service. Thank you!", "Love the color and they\u2019re comfortable to wear. I get comments every time I wear them", "Can\u2019t wear thick socks. I ordered down a size based on reviews. Boots fit with thin socks only.", "The green was brighter than I was hoping it would be. My biggest issue is that it is not suitable for bigger calf folk. It just suctioned right to the calf and hard to get off.", "Perfect for our rainy, muddy weather. Cleans up nicely in the garden sink. Stylish too,", "Absolutely love these bright red boots! They are cute and comfortable and just what I needed.", "I love these boots. They\u2019re comfortable and not too bulky on my feet. I love stepping in puddles, so these boots are perfect!", "Top of boot is very narrow. Also, the boot bends at the back above the ankle when walking a becomes uncomfortable quickly.", "Love! I own a few and love all the colors They do run a little bigger", "It is hard when there are no half sizes but I love these boots", "LOVED this rain boot! Order your normal shoe size. I read several reviews that said size down but I am glad I didn't. The boot isn't tight so there is room for hunter inserts or big socks but it also isn't too big with just a normal sock. The shoes fit great and are amazing quality. Also $40 less on Amazon than the website.", "They were too big so I sent back, didn't re-order due to the fact the size 10 was $97 and size 9 was $165 so I didn't order..", "Top of boots are sharp and hard. Wore these to the beach a few days in a row and they rubbed against my legs and actually cut my shins and calves. Tall socks helped, but still uncomfortable. Not worth the money at all.", "I recieved these boots and really loved them. I should have listened to the other reviews though. I am normally a size 7 and ordered a 7. I had to send them back. I reordered a size 6. I don't plan to use them as winter boots, so I don't need the extra room for thick socks.", "Really great boot but one size too large. Also, the side strap is just for show... you cannot actually tighten the boot around your calf. I was disappointed to have to return. I loved the color and it's well made.", "Bought these as a mother's day gift after my oldest son said he wanted to get them so \"Me and mommy can jump in puddles together\". She loves them and he loves jumping in puddles.", "I am usually a size 8 in almost every shoe.

And the sale price !", "Gave these as a gift and she loves them!! Beautiful color, high quality, and versatile.", "been wanting a pair of these for quite some time the higher boot is to tight for my calf, but these are perfect and fit just right so glad I found them and at such a good price it was easy to say yes", "When the boots arrived the sole was very dirty and the inside fur and tag were very warn. It was obvious they were used.", "Love the vibrant pink color and they\u2019re not too heavy like some rain boots.", "I thought these were supposed to be wide leg, but they aren\u2019t. I have small feet and very muscular calves so my feet are moving all around in the foot part of the boot, but about cut off circulation to my calves. My toes are like 3 inches from the front of the boot", "So I love love my hunter rainboots in shiny red. It fits perfect and looks great on. I can't wait for it to rain for me to style my boots.", "Love my hunter boots. They were a gift .. A bit cold but keep my feet dry. I want to purchase the hunter insert to keep them warmer. They are very stylish I get lots of compliments on them. I would like to purchase in a few other colors..", "Love these boots, they just are a tad too big. Typically, I run a solid 8, and these have some extra wiggle room. I feel a 7 would be too small though.", "Love these boots! I have short legs so these short boots are perfect since the tall boots go tall the way up to my knee. Highly recommended!", "It recommended a 10 which I got but it was way to big. This brand runs big I thought maybe I would get a size up but stick to your size", "A beautiful boot to add to my ever growing Hunter collection. It\u2019s worth all the $$!

Fits perfect", "Bought as a gift for my daughter, who wanted something stylish but durable to wear to soccer games. Cleans easily and still keeps its shine.", "Unfortunately had to be returned. Boot shaft too tight on calf. With additional arch support shoe felt pretty good, but absolutely too tight on calf causing it to bunch up and certainly no room for pants inside boot. Really like the eggplant color though.", "Love these boots! My calf\u2019s are a little bit on the wider side and they still have some wiggle room in them. No complaints and are true to size so order your usual size.", "I got the right size. I usually wear a 9 W but the boots only come in Medium and its wide enough and sure to keep me dry.

I have gotten many compliments on them! I did order my normal size which is a 9 and had to send them back for an 8, so be sure to size down!", "I love them. Even after sizing down, they still are a bit larger than anticipated. I will keep them and use socks for the difference in size, but I intended to use them to get to and from work in the Florida rains and therefore would be wearing stockings the majority of the time. Easy fix, but I might get a size 5 next time. Usually wear 6 1/2 in everyday. Gloss is perfect and everything else about them is great! Highly recommend.", "This was for a costume but I splurged a bit and choose to buy Hunter because of it having such a great reputation.

Do buy the socks, my jeans stained the inside.", "I am 5\"3\" and knew I didn't need a knee high boots these are perfect! I wore them in the mud and melting snow my feet where warm with thin socks!

The boot is so cute and the price was awesome.", "I love these boots but there is a hardened plastic bit in the back of the boot which may irritate a person with a wider leg.", "Product was worn before.

It\u2019s great!!!", "Love them. Definitely read other reviews writing about the size and fit. I did to help decide what size to get.", "The boot actually hurts my legs when I walk. It\u2019s awkward where the rubber hits you calf. I\u2019m only 5\u20192\u201d so maybe that is why? Not sure, but definitely can\u2019t walk far in them comfortably. I wouldn\u2019t buy again.", "I don\u2019t like the fact that you guys don\u2019t have half sizes. 8 is to tight and 9 is huge. The calf is etca wife as well.

I love them.", "Authentic Hunter boots! Packaged in Hunter box and quick shipping! So very happy with this purchase.", "I read the reviews and chose a size 8 rather than a 9 since I usually wear 8.5. 9 would have been too big. Glad I went with an 8.", "Only comes in full sizes.

They are comfortable enough and cute enough to wear all day.", "I read many reviews and did lots of research on these boots. I wear a 6.5. Since they don't carry half sizes I went down to a 6. It fit just like a 6.5 even with warm socks. I've worn these for a camping trip, thru a corn maze and doing yard work. They are easy to wash off. If the color gets dull you can just rub some olive oil on them and they are shiny again. You also cant beat the Amazon price. I love my Hunter boots.", "I love these hunter boots.

They arrived quickly, packaged well. The box was in great condition,I have large caves about 17\" around and these are a little tight but not bad. My shoes size is a 8.5, but since these are only 8 or 9 I ordered the 8, I probably should have ordered the 9, but I'll make do because I love them so much. Great price! Fast shipping!

Pretty and fashionable!!", "They fit great! I can\u2019t stay out of them just what I wanted!!!", "Do yourself a favor and try on in a store before ordering online. I traveled 50 miles just to try these on at a retailer. Worth the trouble, as the return shipping would be less than ideal when you find they don't fit and need to order another size--they run large! I wear a 7 or 7.5 and ordered a 6! I love them. Wish it rained more where I live :)", "Heavier than expected. Much heavier than my knee high hunters.

This worthy purchase of a boot is remarkably stable, durable, and lightweight. It is also a grippy platform that requires minimal break-in time. However, many wearers were disappointed with the Danner 453\u2019s frail outsole, bleeding ankle liner, and too-narrow fit. Its fragile shoelaces and abrasive lace hooks further compounded the negativity which surrounded the boot. Scores of satisfied customers became instant Danner fans after experiencing this footwear\u2019s amazing traction firsthand The Danner 453 deeply impressed a huge portion of the reviewing population with its feather-like lightness This mid-cut backpacking boot requires minimal-to-no break-in time, and many wearers couldn\u2019t agree more Many experts and users were smitten by the Danner 453 with its enormous level of comfort An expert among them even likened it to a well-worn tennis shoe Based on a number of favorable reviews, this boot\u2019s arch support is genuinely top notch A moderate percentage of reviewers were at a loss for words because it's a hiking boot with excellent waterproofing This premium-priced hiking footwear is considered a smart purchase by many Some experts praised the Danner 453 for its commendable durability Its toughness lasted an expert\u2019s pair through punishing outdoor ventures for more than two years Danner\u2019s 453 provides great stability on challenging treks, according to a handful of owners One of them reported that even pointy rocks couldn\u2019t destabilize him A considerable number of owners couldn\u2019t help but feel disgusted with the boot\u2019s outsole for wearing thin too quickly Many passionate hikers were flabbergasted by the Danner 453\u2019s thin laces These laces, according to them, were too scrawny to give them a secure ankle fit Some wearers found the boot too narrow Even the 2E - wide still felt too cramped and restrictive for them A handful of reviewers detested the hook eyelets for bruising their laces and rendering them unusable The ankle cuff\u2019s inner liner bleeds and stains socks, based on a few critical reviews", "source_documents": ["Perfect and confortable feels like they were made exactly to fit me, no need to brake them in. I\u2019ve always been a true and loyal Danner costumer the Co. Customer service have proven excellent service over and over in previous warranty\u2019s issues. Thanks for a great pair of boots. Captain. Jay", "These boots came ready to wear right out of the box. I had Danners when I served in the military in Alaska. Tough boots for a tough environment. They are still producing the same quality products. I work contruction and am on my feet all day. These boots have been very comfortable from the first moment. No real break in time required. Arch support is excellent. I did order the wider size after reading the other reviews, so when I say fit as expected, I expected them to be a bit narrow, but the wide width has worked out fine for me. I consider these boots highly recomendable.", "I have had great luck with Danner boots for years and these are no exception. For hiking, work, or leisure these boots work excellently. They are not overly heavy and they fit like wearing a tennis shoe. I am on my feet For most of the day and these give me plenty of support and comfort. I would purchase these again and again.", "Love these boots! Been wearing these since my first pair that I bought for a Boundry Waters Canoe trip 20 years ago. Liked them so much I started wearing these every day! True comfort from the first minute!!", "This is my third or fourth pairs of Danner's. All the others fit as expected. But the first pair of these I ordered the same size as the rest. They were way too small and too tight, so I exchanged them for a bigger pair, which fit okay. That being said, I don't like the way they wear. The tongue has extra padding which should be nice. But top holder for the laces is so low that cinching them down does not hold the tongue down. My pants ride up and hang up on top of the tongue. The only pair of Danner's I've had that i don't like.", "I've worn Danner 453 boots FOREVER. Boy Scout hikes and campouts, deer hunts, fishing tips, and just everyday use. When I found out they were making 'em in beautiful full grain leather, I had to have a pair. They broke in great and are amazingly comfortable - now tied with my regular nubuck 453s as my favorite boots. Danner website has proper care products - I used the boot dressing and waterproofing gel. They also have replacement laces - get the 72 inch ones if you use French knots.", "Very durable. Got just what I ordered. This is the boot that soldiers wore during the Desert East Conflict (War). Extremely durable. Tongue is made so that sand & dirt cannot get into the boot along the sides of the tongue. Will buy again. Are waterproof. Plenty warm in the winter without being insulated. Well worth the price.", "I don't write too many reviews but this boot is extremely comfortable. Actually comfortable right out of the box. I had them on about 14 hours the first day I got them and my feet were very comfy. They seem to be very well made. I haven't tested the water proofing on the boots yet but with a name like Danner, one can only expect high performance. I wear mens size 9.5 and thats what I ordered and the fit was perfect.", "The boots only lasted 6 months of normal wear. I work with Search and Rescue. These boots have literally fallen apart at the seams. At the toe and heal areas. They claim to be waterproof but have fallen short since day one. I\u2019m not sure of this is the new standard, but I would not spend the money on a boot that is made outside the US were there are no quality assurances. With these boots irs buyer be ware. Good luck and happy trails.", "This is my 3rd pair of this style of boot from Danner. I find them to be the most comfortable boot I've ever worked in. The first pair I bought are now close to 8 years old. So the durability is there for me. The Goretex liners make these extremely comfortable even in the hot desert of eastern Washington. The quality, looks and price make these an excellent value and I hope Danner keeps making this style boot in the future. I would recommend these for work, hiking, everyday knock around or dress. An excellent boot in my honest opinion.", "As with other Danner boots, the overall quality is outstanding, from the leather to the stitching to the soles etc. not to mention the great styling. The one real issue I had was that the Gore-Tex lining slipped constantly. My feet were just too wide to fit, so ultimately I had to return them, much as I didn't want to.", "I loved these right out of the box. Very comfortable leather padding on the tounge & collar. I most times wear a 10w or 10.5w. These were 10.52e. The fit is perfect for me. My feet tend to swell a little on a long day hike. The !/2 size bump allows just enough space for these times. i was a little worried about the craftsmanship of these compared to it's US mate. I find these are extremly well put together ample stitching all around. I'll have to wait a year or so for a long term review.", "these will wear better than the Danner 452 shoes. I had a pair of 452s and they were very comfortable but wore out very fast. the 453s seem to have a more heavy duty sole on them. Although lacing them up could be easier. so far i'd buy these shoes again.", "I had received a pair that looked to have had been previously bought, and then returned. There were slight scratch marks on the right and a glue mark. I\u2019ve had the radical 452s for years and decided to switch to these. It would have been 5 stars had they not had the few marks on them. They\u2019re comfy and I ordered a half size larger then normal which I believe I\u2019m glad I did. They feel great and the wife\u2019s have plenty of toe space. Be warned the break in period sucks for these but after you\u2019ll be so glad you got them.", "Good durable hiking shoes. Nice firm base for extra comfort and stability (especially if you are hiking with a heavy pack on sharp pointy rocks. Wet traction isn't great. Very durable upper. Update: After 6 years of use.....soles partly worn through. Uppers still in great shape and boots still good enough for kicking around town (not really good for hiking or work as treads are worn out). I'd buy these again and I did. 2nd Pair is just as great. We'll worth the money.", "These took me a little time to break them in and it has been a long time since I had to do that. The all leather construction is robust so I wore them around the house off and on for a few weeks and the fit is improving. I have a wide foot and bought the EE. I have been using Danner hiking boots for 20 plus years and these might be the best I've owned and I've owned some nice boots over the years. I personally had to break these in a bit but now that they have \"learned\" my foot I know these are going to last for years.", "I bought my first pair of these boots many years ago and they served me well. I'm very pleased that this new pair of the same model has the same quality of construction and fit that I grew to enjoy and rely upon. I expect my new pair will also provide years of comfortable service.", "These are great looking boots! Purchased them for my boyfriend and he couldn't be happier. The photo is a great representation for the actual boot -- color is spot on. They appear to be very well made. He wore them for 10+ hours and said they required no breaking in, and were extremely comfortable from the first step. Sizing note: he is usually an 11 across the board, and had to return for an 11.5 in these as they ran a bit narrow. They are a great price...snag them while you can!", "Buy them. I walk 5 to 8 miles daily while working, outdoor dirt & mud and indoor concrete slab floors. My size 14 feet stay dry and comfortable. IMO the styling is unique and compliments jeans & overalls.", "It has been 4 months since Christmas, and Hub is still loving his boots! He had to break them in, as you have to do when the materials are high quality, so don't wear them new on your first hike! Hub wore his around the house for a good couple of weeks, and they eased into the shape of his foot. He can hardly stand to wear anything else....", "Can't really provide any useful info on wearability, comfort, etc. All I can say is I was oh so disappointed to get them and find out that they were about a 1/2 size too short, which is \"okay\" as I debated about which size to get. More disheartening was the width. I ordered EE and I 'm highly doubtful I size 9 would fit me either. These were very tight width wise and also in terms of the toe box height. I've heard nothing but good about Danner so again...I'm not rating these boots or Danner on the quality, etc. only the sizing.", "Good boots. Guys complaining about the top eyelet being too narrow. It's a lock, it is supposed to be narrow. It's how you set the lace tension so you can follow up with your knot and not loose the tension you just set.", "They run a bit tight if you wear thick socks. I went up a half size and glad I did. They look great but aren't broken in yet. I'll reserve my true rating for a couple months.", "Got the boots today. Opened the box and they looked good. Put them on, they felt good. Took a few steps and was surprised how loudly they squeaked. No way could I wear these things in public. I expected better quality from Danner. I greased the top of the tongues and the squeaking stopped. Last pair of Danner boots for me.", "I originally bought a pair of Vasques in wides after my Keens (which I had 500+ miles on) finally fell apart. I have really wide feet and thought the wide Vasques would good. They were way to sloppy and I couldn't lace 'em tight enough to change it. I stopped into Cabelas and told the guy what I was looking for and he recommended these Danners. They felt worlds better before I even laced them up. These are ridiculously comfortable and I could have been happier with the price from Amazon as well ($30 cheaper than Cabelas).", "Yeah these are very comfortable and look nice to. They fit about a half size small. I wear a 12 or 12 1/2 normally at a store. But I have ordered boots on Amazon before and know to order 13's. Fit perfectly. I have been wearing Danners for 25 years, USA and Import for Corrections work and I like them both.", "The style was fine and boots look like they would be sturdy but in just walking around the house (hard floors or carpet), they squeak like mad. I returned them.", "If you remember that these run a bit small and order an extra size up - these are stellar boots!! I always order a size larger for hiking boots anyway so this was a no brainer. I also went with the EE as I have a wide foot. Ive been wearing Vasque boots for YEARS (last pair - the Wasatch) and these are my first Danners. So far I feel these are superior in quality to the Vasque offerings. We shall see how they hold up over time.", "These are awesome boots -- just don't ever walk through water that is high enough to get inside. I was wearing them while transitioning to an island to do some exploring; instead of getting out on the shore or a dock as expected, I had to wade to shore in 18\" of water. The boots got soaked and stayed that way the entire day; a week later, the Goretex inside and the leather are still damp. My advice: if you're wearing these out for more than a day hike, think very carefully before you walk through that stream or puddle because once they get wet inside, you're going to have a hard time getting them dried out at camp later.", "Had 2 pairs of women's Danner 453 hikers that were awesome!! Since no longer available I took a chance and ordered a men's size 7 Danner 453 hiking boot and I am so pleased! I work in the automotive industry and I'm constantly up and down on my feet for 12 hours a day. Can't beat comfort, fit and exceptional quality. I bought a second pair and put in my closet \"just in case\" they become scarce in the next few years. I recommend for all men and women!", "I'm sure the boots would work great if I got them in the regular size instead of EE. Other than that, waterproof and comfortable to wear. I did oil them for additional protection and to increase the longevity. Wore them in the wilds of Alaska. I don't think my feet got wet from the outside in, I think my feet sweat. Since being home in Wisconsin, I've wore them hunting. Snow and swamp couldn't stop me and my feet were dry.", "I just returned a pair of boots at paid $74 for and they were a cheap product these are the best shoes you can buy they look great they show great very happy", "Love these ready wear boots. I wear them hunting and working. I worked as log truck driver and now a custodian. These do it all. If you are going to ge tythem wet daily you need to treat them! As all leather it will crack. So take alittle time to rub some stuff on them. They will last a year to 2 years with everyday use. Now I do not have stunky feet and I do not hope in every dam mud puddle so some people may not have long use. Do not exscept them to last as long as your old pair of Danner your paid 3to 4 hundred for.", "I like these boots. I buy a pair about once a year for working in the remodeling industry. I wear them 6-7 days a week and they hold up very well, and are very comfortable. I wear a newer pair for casual wear while breaking them in for work later on.", "Danner makes a great boots they are tough, comfortable the only boots in 30 years in the Army that never hurt my feet breaking them in. No hot spots after 10 miles of walking. Now that I am retired i still trust them and they last if you take care of them.", "Excellent hikers. Lightweight and quality you'd expect from Danner. These are very well made. Very comfortable from the start. I wear and 8D and these fit like a glove. Highly recommended.", "I got these boots for my boyfriend, and they absolutely have no arch support and I On top of that it made his toes peel. We are not happy at all with these boots.", "Best boots for digging with a shovel. They have a plastic kick plate under them between your heel and toes that doesn\u2019t let your foot bend while pushing down on the shovel. I used these for work boots and my foot pain is gone.", "Bought these for my boyfriend. He has some that he ADORES, and wanted another pair before they were discontinued. Says they are really comfortable. Are wearing extremely well and we live in northern Wisconsin.", "I really want to love these boots but the foot area is too narrow at the balls of the feet. I own two other Danner Acadia and Danner Bull Run boots and do not have this problem in 13 D. I will try a 13EE and give my final verdict on the matter. I am going with the 452 because I am not impressed with the lace system on the 453, there is a lot of friction and weak laces, I am confident this will lead to lots of new laces for this style.", "These are much more gray than the pictures suggest. I ordered wide (ee) but they were still very tight on the side of my feet. Length was accurate for what was ordered.", "Danner Boots combined with a Sole insole is the perfect combination. My FitBit total steps is just over 16 million steps. All of the steps are with Danner Boots. I have had about 8 pair in the past 10 years. I have wide feet and a high instep. These boot are very comfortable and give my toes plenty of room. A large \"toe box\" is very important to comfort.", "These are well made boots. This is my first purchase of the Danner, and I'm glad I did.", "I am very impressed with the fit and quality of these boots. I have very wide feet and the 2x fits them nicely. I'm a welder and on my feet for twelve plus hours a day and the comfort these boots provide is amazing. Definitely highly recommend. They seem already broken in and I am able to kneel and stoop like I am wearing my favorite athletic shoes. Danner does it again. Thanks Amazon, you're #1", "I've been wearing these boots for 24 hours and they were totally comfortable right out of the box. I bought an 8.5 EE. Construction is attractive and seems durable. Their next test will be their waterproof characteristics, but at this point I'm totally happy with everything about this boot.", "I have been wearing these almost every day for over a month. Very comfortable! I tried on this model at a local sporting goods store. The eyelets on those boots were plastic and the laces did not pull through them very well. When I found these on Amazon I could tell that they had metal eyelets. The laces pull through easily and the boots fit me perfectly.", "I recently went to Portland for a wedding and to just walk around and shop. I easily put 10 miles on these in the downtown area in 3 days. Really comfortable and easy to wipe clean because of all the homeless urine and poo.", "I'm a Danner fan. For many years now I've used the 452 model for camping hiking and yard work without complaint. I needed to make a change in work shoes so i decided to try these knowing how my 452's worked out. They're durable and fit comfortably, not to narrow, once I put in my preferred insole. And you can't beat Amazons price. Great hiker you won't regret buying them.", "A very narrow and stiff boot. Between the fit and seeing on the tongue tag that they were made in china, I returned them.", "I exchanged these for the radical, but only because of personal preferences. These were very comfortable. The first issue I had was that I like to use paracord for my laces, and these boots don't have standard lace holes. The second issue was that these only have one hook grommet above the ankle, and the radical has two. When coming back down from hiking up high, the second grommet helps keep my toes from pressing into the front of the boot. Also, if you are actually going to hike, you should get a EE, and make the boot tight around your ankle and not compress the toebox.", "These boots spent the last year getting put through the wringer , they've been covered in sheetrock dust ,thin set , concrete and everything else you would expect on a job site and have held up very well ,I've just starting having some separation in the toe area on one boot ,other than that they've been great .if you are a flooring installer or spend a lot of time grinding your toes on a slab these are some boots for you!!!", "I\u2019m a 14 medium, the boot runs a bit small.", "Used to love these boots. Bought a pair last year and sent back because they squeak when you walk. Time did not improve. I was embarrassed walking in office. I tried purchasing again buying American thinking I just got a bad pair. Squeaks! Going back! Watch video. Who could even wear these?!", "great workman ship with exception of the last lace won't close the tongue. returning with regret.", "Well made boots. I do wish Danner would have put the second eyelet on the top part of the boot. The provided laces NEVER stay tied. After I switched to aftermarket laces, they stay tied. Totally waterproof. I work in the water almost everyday and these keep me dry. Not much grip on snowy slopes but they are great on dry ground.", "These are the workboot of choice for the hard working person that these were gifted to. Since finding these at a store, this is all they wear every winter. When they wear out they are replaced by the same boot. I've seen the laces snap after much use and abuse, extended wear.", "You get what you pay for with these bad boys. The most comfortalble boot and the looks are eye catching.", "Absolutely a great pair of boots. Waterproof, but not insulated.....I also own a pair of Danner Pronghorns with 400 Grams of insulation, and they seem a bit \"clunky.\" These boots fit perfect. Minimal break in of about two days and I couldn't be happier. I now wear them daily.", "one odd thing, boots never change, but the price does", "I wear size 11 c/d. The boots fit perfectly. Appear to be very well made, good stitching, leather and smooth interior. They are a little heavy but not too bad considering how heavy duty they appear. My only concern is the laces don't seem very robust.", "This is the 6th pair I\u2019ve owned. I work in \u2018em, I hunt in \u2018em, I take the garbage out in \u2018em, I go to church in \u2018em. Minimal break in time. My life expectancy is 2/2.5 years on one pair. Laces get chewed up every 3-4 months, but I do strap these pups on tight. 10/10.", "These boots have been my general wear boot for more than 5 years. They last more than 2 years of every day wear. Love them!", "Noisiest shoe I have ever worn. Squeak, squeak, squeak. Walking down the hall, people stop talking and stare. What a terrible boot, to have fit so well!", "Great product. Shoe fits as expected. The only thing I don't like is the metal grommets, especially when the metal rubs on the inside of the boot. Otherwise, they're fantastic.", "I purchased these boots for a week-long hiking trip out West. The trip hasn't happened yet. However, I've taken a couple of day trip hikes wearing them and I'm super impressed! The fit is perfect, comfort level is high with no break-in period needed. I've even worn these while running errands. Great boots!", "My third pair of 453 GTX. They fit great and perform great. The only knock I have is that the sole wears out and the boot cannot be resoled so you have to buy a new pair. But I knew that when I bought them. Will continue to use this boot for hiking as long as Danner continues to make them.", "Seems to be a good boot. This is my second pair. The first ones lasted just over a year. Boot was still good soles were shot. I wish Danner made a hiker style boot that was made in the USA.", "They are definitely a well made boot. The Gore Tec makes them really water proof and they are really good quality. My only problem is the tread. On porous floors such as concrete or out doors in the summer they are great but on smooth floors with just a hint of oil or on ice they have no traction.", "Returned the shoes because they were smaller than another pair of Danner boots I have. However, these appear to be very well made.", "I work in construction, hi rise super structure, I,be tried a lot of brands , this Danner Boot is the most comfortable, durable boot I,vet ever worn. This is my second pair (same model) and I WILL NOT WEAR ANOTHER BOOT !!! My last pair is 2 years old and I,m still wearing them daily !!! More comfortable then my Redwings, they fit like a glove, the cushioned insole is the most comfortable, my back doesn't hurt at the end of the the day and I walk up and down 6-15 story buildings daily !!!! Love the boot !!!!!", "My husband is a larger guy and he goes through boots within a year or less. This is the 2nd time he has purchased this model of Danner Boots. They provide good support throughout the day and he can work in the rain/mud and have dry feet. He definitely endorses them.", "I started 9 years ago with my first pair of Danner hiking boots. Still have them but they are finally going to need some repairs. Plan on some hiking this summer at Glacier NP in Montana and purchased these. Purchased some mink oil and waterproofed them and they look great and feel great and I could not be happier. Very comfortable yet very durable as well. If your thinking about them then go ahead.", "These are fantastic boots. This is my third pair. I use them for working in various conditions from 90 degrees in summer to -38 degrees in the winter, in rain and snow. They are durable, supportive and provide great traction on uneven terrain. The only drawback that I have ever found is that a lot of sweat will cause the coloring from the upper to stains white socks.", "These shoes took several weeks of intense hiking before they were finally broken in. -Intense being hiking three to ten miles a day, five days a week, for three weeks straight. After three weeks, the arch finally wore in to conform to my feet. Initially, the arches were way too high for my flat feet, but as I said, they eventually wore in. These shoes seem very durable after using them intensely for the last month. They provide great support and keep my feet comfortable during long and arduous hikes. Additionally, they are great about staying waterproof in very wet, damp environments.", "The boot is comfortable but the laces constantly loosen. Also you can't cinch the boot up at ankle.", "I had worn Keen boots for years however within the last 4 or 5 years their quality has gone downhill, both uppers and lowers have been falling apart. Danner has always made quality products and the fit and finish of these boots are impeccable.", "I like the Danner 453 because it fits my foot well and I use it for work (construction). However I have had this particular pair of boots for a month now and they squeak like the day I took them out of the box. Previous 453 Danners have not done this and it drives me nuts! Probably be looking for something other than Danners next time.", "I've had several Danner boots in the past, they have always been great. These boots are no exception but SQUEEK, SQUEEK, SQUEEK! I saw another reviewer said they took sandpaper to the material by the shoe's tongue. I hope that works.", "Be careful, they are sized on the small size, and free returns only applies if the product is defective.", "Fits just like the Radical 452 GTX that I've been buying/wearing for eight or ten years. This boot doesn't have the Gore-Tex panels though. I suppose it's even more waterproof, but probably won't breathe as well. It's also a tad heavier. So far, it's a sturdy hiking boot.", "This is my second pair of these boots, I've worn my first pair for 5 years during the 5 or 6 months of winter weather and finally wore the tread off the soles. This is the best boot I've ever purchased, comfortable, very strong and don't sweat your feet off.", "Great boots. They take a while to break in, but they were comfortable enough from the start where break in was not bad. It took a couple of weeks to get them broken in decently though, but now they are awesome.", "I have the USAF Danner boot for work and found I used them even at home. I tried these because they have the same sole as my work boots. So far I have put a lot of miles on them and they are great! And, the majority of those miles have been off trail and they have really taken the abuse.", "Fits fine . But around the ankle Boot only goes that high.. Tore up my ankle to the point of bleeding .. I had to cut some socks to thickin up that area until the darn thing breaks in.. So beware of that issue.. I wish i bought a Carhartt boot.. Better made", "These boots are worth every penny...except they tend to run somewhat small & narrow,might I suggest you go one size larger than you'd normally wear.Even though there made in China... it's still one heck of a boot.The quality is spot on.", "Great boot. Bought it for hiking the mountains in Montana and works perfectly. Basically no break in period .", "Having irritation points on the top of my arch from the top eyelet rubbing the arch. Not present on firts two pair of these boots. Soles are wearing out before the leather uppers.", "Bought both sons the boots and they wear them everyday. Both are on their feet all day outside and say they are very comfortable. Would buy again.?", "Built like hiking boots used to be! I have been VERY disappointed in the quality of modern hiking boots. I purchased some Vasque boots that lasted only months, followed by Merrell boots that were no better. I am so glad Danner still makes a boot that is made with quality materials. The only thing that could make them better is if they were still American made.", "This is my second pair of Danners. The soles of my first pair wore out WAAAY before the uppers. They still look great. These new boots look great, fit great, feel great.", "I wear a 14M and these fit. I put them on and walked 3 miles. I do feel that they need to be broken in. I compared a lot of boots. These are solid and the toe cover will withstand anything that it hits.", "Been wearing these boots for years because danners fit me perfectly. The only difference between these and the ones they replaced is they are very noisy. They Creek a lot. But fit and feel fine.", "Danners quality is unsurpasssed and it shines through in these. Ive wasted a lot of money buying boots that only lasted a few weeks maybe a couple of months before they started to break down these look good and more importantly feel amazing. Best boots I've had in a long time. So good in fact I'm going to be ordering them in a darker color.", "I am happy I ordered these boots! I got them a little early so that was a great surprise and what was even better was that they fit just how I needed. The extra wide fit was absolutely needed for my wide feet. These boots look amazing, they are by far the best looking boot I have ever owned. Now, they are new so I obviously dont know how they will take their punishment but I can say that these things look and feel solid. Oh and they are already comfortable without breaking them in. Always a good sign. I hope we can go on many adventures together for a long long time. :)", "My 2nd pair of these for work, I have worn the soles out but the uppers are in great shape, I can trash a pair of cheap boots in a month or two, and the last pair I wore 5 days a week at work, a lot outside, and they lasted 1 year. Money well spent.", "I have sore feet after wearing. I even tried thicker socks hoping to give the shoe a more comfortable fit. Nothing has worked, I was expecting more from Danner. The outter material is fine.", "This is the best boot I've ever owned. Fit was perfect out of the box. This is my second pair and I will continue to buy Danner products, their customer service is outstanding. Delivery was quick as expected. The only problem is I waited too long to buy Danner boots, thought I couldn't afford them. I was wrong you get what you pay for here.", "I couldn't even walk around my bedroom for 10 minutes to give these a good test run. They hurt so freaking bad around my ankles that I started limping. The soles are hard and lumpy and they get narrow where my toes start. Danner Sharptail were the best shoes I had ever worn asid from the painful blisters on my shins that they caused-I returned those too. Their shoes have no cushion around the ankle parts. This is the second pair of Danners that have majorly disappointed me. I officially give up on Danner.", "I have ordered these boots several times and will continue until they're no longer available", "Had to exchange because felt little tight but after getting a larger size they look great and are very comfortable.", "Warm, Tough, Comfortable.... Fits true to size. I'm a girl and I get the MOST compliments on this boots from the guys I work with. Honestly, they think it is one cool looking boot!", "Quality comfortable boots. Would recommend it. I have had about 20 pairs of boots throughout my life.", "As always Danner's are AWESOME!!!!!! No break in time!!!! Highly recommend", "nice looking boot but too small. Read the fine print on returns before buying.....", "Well built but I seem to be getting a lot of heel wear, already which translates to knee pain when I walk. Not sure why the rubber compound couldn't be a harder makeup.", "Been wearing them since they came this morning and I've never had boots so comfortable out of the box! If these continue to impress me, I'll be buying dinner boots for life!", "I love my Danners! I wore them in the Army and they were good then and even better now! Thank you very much!", "I bought these from Amazon Warehouse Deals, and only paid $66 for them because someone tried them on and didn't like and returned. Worth $66 for sure, but if I had of paid the $145 or so, I would probably return them as well.", "I really like thee boots and they fit my foot well. Just make sure that you break them in before making any trip of any length first. They are a little stiff.", "Love Danner boots. Seemed a little snug width wise and in length but not to bad. Hoping when broke in a little it will be better. Time will tell? I've bought boots before trying a little wider and a bigger size up but seemed to loose. Will try to follow up at a later date after breaking period.", "I knew these would be a little short so I sized up 1/2 size. Also knew I needed the EE width. Fit perfectly, but had I not known from a previous pair of danners i would have ordered my normal 12.5 EE and they would have been a little short, especially when thick socks are needed. These seem to be extremely well built as expected. A little heavy but should last until the soles wear out. Love danner!", "Inside stitching didn't last very long... The heel interior is demolished.", "I've had surgery on my left Achilles tendon and these boots, while otherwise comfortable, are at just the right height to cause pain and soreness. Not the fault of the boots, but I still can't wear them.", "My husband loves this style of boot. This is the 3 pair he has purchased. The soles never wear out, and that is a big plus for him because he walks on rock most of the day.", "I been buying danner boots for last 20 years they are the best", "This is my 2nd pair of these 453 boots, most comfortable boots I have ever worn and longest lasting", "Excellent shoe. Runs smaller than your actual size. It is my second pair of the identical shoe. First pair lasted 4-5 years of hard winter and summer wear.", "Very happy with my new Danners! My other hikers were worn out with holes so this are much appreciated. I have been wanted a pair of Danners for a long time. Thanks Amazon for the great price.", "Got these for my husband. He really likes them. The sizing is accurate to his feet.", "Fits great and great quality but the lace loops are abrasive to shoe strings. I have to change out the shoe strings every two months. Other than that, it would be a five star.", "I really wanted to like these based on the danner name alone but they just didn't work for me. I ordered 8.5 wide and the width was just not there and the seam was in a wrong spot on my foot.", "This is very early. But I wore the boots for 6 hours the first time I put them on. No issues. Appear very sturdy and are good looking. No surprises, and I like that.", "Great shoes, my husband wears them for work (ranch and farm). There was no break in time and they look great even going through the irrigation seasons. They fit just like all danners do and my husband loves them.", "I have several styles of Danner boots and these fit just like expected. There could be just a more room in the toe area for a better fit. A little disappointed with the Nu Buck material. Very stiff and I don't expect them to last as long as my leather Danner Boots. Boot is overpriced for NuBuck material. 3 starts", "I bought these to replace a pair of 453's which are the most comfortable boots I've ever worn! The new pair aren't broken in but are made with the same quality craftsmanship and materials. I'm hooked on Danner boots.", "Would like to give five stars but since I have already had to replace the laces after only two months that is why I'm only giving four. Other than that the boots are extremely comfortable and good quality.", "These are very nice boots. I've only began to break them in and they are already very comfortable. I expect I will be very happy with them once I am climbing the mountains in Montana. Seem to be well made and of good quality. Got them on sale for about half price too.", "I've owned several pairs of Danner's and they do tend to run narrow. I'm an 11 EEE and they only make it in a EE. I understood that when I purchased them. After a little time every pair I've bought has ended up braking in excellent and I believe these will also. Everyday their getting better.", "Seems to be a great boot. Top collar around the back of your leg will take a bit to break in. Very comfortable otherwise.", "Boots are great! A little heavy. I have had them close 10 months now. The laces broke. I am replacing them with Kevlar boot laces.", "Last pair of danner boots lasted years with same use. I feel like I got ripped off with this pair. Already in the trash.", "added a gel cushion for a little bounce but the boots are great.", "Attractive boot, but they run large across the toes and instep; which caused the boots to move on your foot when you walked. Not that comfortable, returned them.", "great hiking boot like the way it fit but ask me in about year and I will tell you how they work out for me", "Great boots that keep your feet dry walking in wet grass. The bottoms will ware down in about 10 to 12 months. At that point I buy new Danners. This is my 3rd pair of Danners!", "My 3rd pair, last about 3 years walking around industrial facilities, great boots for hiking, camping or general wear.", "The boot was of good quality but the sizing seems off. I usually wear a wide and I ordered a wide but it felt extremely narrow. I wound it returning them.", "My husband had the same brand for 8 years!!!! We are so happy that could find them again. They are not too heavy and fit very well for him. He is a contractor and never complained that his feet are cold during winter months. .You can use them when you go hunting!", "Another awesome pair of Danners! Been wearing these over a year now and the are great! Super lite! They stand up to snow, mud, water, all without being too hot. These are great for the trail or for work.", "My husband is pretty picky about his shoes and boots! HE loves these boots! They do run 1/2 small so you will want to order 1/2 size larger!", "I did a five mile hike with gators in deep snow. Awesome!! My feet were dry and didn't hurt at all for them coming out of the box. Perfect fit. Only thing is I wish they had loops for the gators.", "These are wonderful and you will never go wrong with \"Danner\"", "Very good boots. Nice coverage, excellent support and reasonable weather proof in a lighter leather package.", "I work construction and have wore many boots. These boots are the only ones that I have ever put on and not had to break in. There was no sore spots or blisters. The only boots I will ever buy.", "Shoe laces pulled apart 2 weeks after I got them, meaning the outer coating frayed so now Im left with white nylon string in place of the laces in certain spots.", "These boots fit great. The only drawback is that the laces seem to break too often.", "Perfect boots, atleast for me at 300lb and 6 foot 2. Better than all the others I tried.", "Great boots right out of the box. No painful break in\ud83d\ude01", "Do your feet a favor and buy these boots. They are extremely well built and comfortable.", "This is my third pair of these that I have purchased.", "Boot fit perfect the first time. The size runs as stated. Great fix.", "I've only had it on a few hikes, but the fit so far feels right. I've not noticed any water seepage when crossing creeks or going through wet grass.", "Danner boots are the best ! I've tried a lot of boots, but I've settled for Danner.", "Bought these for my husband who works in construction and he loves them.They fit well, good quality and cheaper than the Redwing boots he usually buys.", "The size is perfect. My feet never hurt at all. No \"break-in pains. Awesome. Fast delivery,too.", "So far so good. More grey to it than i expected but it still looks good. Comfortable boot!", "fast shipping and a very comfortable well made shoe. Love the feel and the look. The only thing that is different is the room in the heel to move up and down.", "Very comfortable, used the to hike a trail at Yosemite", "I guess everyone's feet are different, but I found these extremely uncomfortable. Also found it very easy to turn my ankle when wearing them.", "Initial impression for these boots is they area going to last a long time. I love the way they look, the eyelets for the laces makes getting these bad boys off and on a breeze. Because of the lacing system you can really get these snug. I normally wear a 10 and ordered a 10 e2e. Even in the wider size the are kinda narrow. I don't believe these would fit at all in the narrower size. I've walked a few miles in them and they're almost broken in. They come pretty stiff out of the box, but now they are pretty comfortable. I will check back in a few months to give a more in depth review.", "Boots fit very well & look nice too. Quality leather & front toe guard is very useful. I do see a future problem though. The shoe strings are starting to fray a little because of the way that the eyelets are designed. But I knew that before ordering them. Aside from having to replace the shoe strings more often, I would still order them.", "Danners is the only work shoe I'll wear!!! For work!", "breaks in easily. comfortable even when new & not broken in. ships free, nice tread, good protection on toe, will buy again.", "Great fit, comfortable but they squeak when you wear them.", "This is the second pair of this shoe my wife has purchased because she likes them so much. She works in a meat production cold area and they work the best for her.", "ISSUE FOR ME IS AN UNUSUALLY HIGH ARCH SUPPORT. FELT LIKE I WAS STANDING ON A ROCK. RETURNED THEM", "Other reviews say these run small. I usually wear a size 11 Danner. I got these in an 11.5 and they fit fine.", "The inner stitching hurt my feet bad... Good outer quality though", "This is my 2nd pair of this type of Danner boot and I'm very happy with the fit and quality. My wide feet are hard to fit and I tried about 10 other brands before I found these. Now I won't be buying anything else!", "They squeak when I walk maybe they will get better after they're broke in .very irritating!!", "Great Boot! These are not made in USA unfortunately but other Danner products are.", "I've owned probably 6 pairs of these. The only boots I've ever bought that really didn't need me to break in. I bought these again a few weeks ago and the price went from $166 to $200. Anyone know why?", "These feel like a quality product. I'd give them 5 stars but I haven't hit the mountains yet", "They fit nicely. Construction seems very durable but only time will tell", "This is a great boot but you need to know it looks like big boot on your foot.", "I keep coming back to these Boots by Danner - I use them for everything from hiking to hunting to everyday jobs around the house, and they hold up well. They are definitely well made and worth the $...", "Fit right and comfortable so far. Still breaking them in.", "Not insulated but still very warm in the snow and wet weather. I bought them to work in but will problem buy a pair for personal wear also. Good quality leather. A little bit of break-in around the upper ankles required. (But I'm switching to the lower height boot) I also wear them when riding my motorcycle, fit great between pegs and shifter.", "use these for work and they are really comfortable but too expensive", "I am size 15, so it's hard to find a boot that fits. Ordered these sight unseen and they fit beautifully. Took them on a 3 day backpacking trip the next week and no complaints. I give them 4 stars because tightening the laces is harder than it should be. The boots are waterproof, but I suggest waterproofing the outside leather as well - it can get soaked through, adding more weight.", "These boots Rock!! True size, fit great, fast shipping, look Outstanding!!", "I have owned a pair of Danner Acadias and trust the Danner name. I did a foolish thing and wore them on a 21 mile weekend hike after a week and a half break in period. I had two huge blisters on the end of my weekend. After breaking them in properly my second hike in them was a cake walk. I would buy them again.", "I have been wearing Danner hunting boots for about 30 years and that is where I start looking when I need a pair of boots, If I were to guess, the energizer bunny wears Danner because they last & last", "I am a dairy farmer and they held up and are extremely comfortable. I am tough on my boots. I am happy with them and will probably buy another pair.", "Fits as expected. I haven't done any serious hiking with them but the boots feel comfortable and they keep my feet pretty warm.", "These shoes were a gift, my son loves them and wears them at work all day.", "Love these boots. Fit is good. Comfortable right out of the box. I have never had a problem with Danner boots", "They fit great. Sole cracked on my other one sooner then expected. But, I liked the fit.

I have a tan rings around my socks at the end of the day. Other wise , i like them.", "5th pair., I really do like these boots, but the boot strings tend to fray soon and break, I am not sure if Danner is aware of this problem with this product.", "I am very happy with my order. Much to my surprise they are a perfect fit and comfortable.", "They fit really small I thought they would stretch out but that never happen", "Very nice boot well made and great customer service .", "Great boot, this is my second pair. I can wear them all day. I will buy these boot as long as Danner makes them.", "This is a very comfortable boot, with the Danner quality water proofing. This is the third pair I've own, I use them for work in construction and they are a good durable boot. The only down side to them is Danner can't re sole them.", "My husband loves this boot. He wears it for work (outside everyday) and for working around our house and yard. He is very happy with the fit and the wear of the boot so far.", "The best pair out of my eight sets of hiking shoes.", "The last pair I received fit just about right. This pair seems large especially the right boot. However these are really good boots. I use them for work and they get abused. Water heat dust etc. The last pair I wore the soles away but the rest of the boot is just about as good as when I originally got them", "Reading reviews, I expected this shoe to be smaller than normal. So instead of my normal size of 10.5, i ordered an 11. Good thing I did! They seem to fit fine. They do seem a little on the skinny side, and would suggest getting a half size up and maybe going with a E(wider) model. Really excited about his boot! I just put them on, they do need some breaking in. After trudging through wet grass and mud (my everyday life) I will come back and review this boot further. Satisfied so far!", "Purchased as a gift for my husband he loves them.", "This purchase is my 10th or 11th pair of 453s. All have been outstanding and comfortable from the first time on my dogs. I do use a work-grade (tougher construction) Odor-Eater insole and always have. I use these shoes for everyday wear and work too. It takes me 10-12 months to wear the heels down on the side to the point that the boots become uncomfortable to wear all day. At that time, I usually tend to try something new to try to save a little money but it never works out and I keep coming back to this Danner model.", "well made , love them so far. looking for long life boots and i found them.", "Great boots! Comfortable as soon as I put them on! Don\u2019t like the laces, but that is a quick fix!", "A little narrow and the laces are fraying after a weeks wear. I would buy these again.", "The only boots I can wear all day, out of the box new.", "This is my second pair. The first lasted 3 years of constant use. Excellent hiker.", "These are the best boots I have ever worn. I am a driver for UPS and I need a sturdy boot. These boots measure up, no break in period just lace up and go. Will be a Danner man from now on.", "I have a gardening business and I am on my feet most of the day. These boots help the pain I was having in my feet from my old worn out boots. They are waterproof also which for me is essential. Well worth the money and this is a heck of a good price from Amazon.", "Best shoes I've ever put on my feet. I have ended up wearing them away from work more often than not. Very rugged - very comfortable...", "Excellent boot. Fit is true to size. Comfortable, good support. Will buy again.", "Best boot ever made. Light weight, tough, waterproof, warm in cold weather, very sportive, and I could go on and on. I have owned several pairs of these boots over the years. Please don't stop making them.", "However, the shoelaces shredded easily against the hooks. Comfortable to walk in. Wore out quickly as I walk alot.", "Great shoes. Very comfortable. My 5th pair in 8 years.", "This is my third pair of 453 GTX. Great fit and comfort right out of the box that gets better with use. I wear them in wet and muddy outdoor working conditions and they keep me dry and warm all winter in Oregon. I have wide feet and it is hard to find a boot that is comfortable, but these make the grade. Just bought another pair for everyday use while not working.", "One boot Is noticeably wider than the other. Don't have the arch support I expected. I guess I should have done my homework, another great American name made in China! At a premium price.", "Very easy to get on and off. I work on my knees a lot so I am always scuffing my toes of my shoes. But these shoe leave no scuffs on the toes I love that. I would recommend it.", "Boots look good, but too narrow. Should come is extra wide, have to wear very thin socks.", "I bought a pair of Bates boots and they are the WORST boots I have ever owned falling apart just after two weeks of wearing. The DANNER boots I bought are GREAT!!! Quality workmanship Comfortable I would recommend the Danner boot line to everyone.", "These shoes came well packaged and on time. They fit great and look good. I wear them nearly day. I reccomend buying them.", "While I have not worn the boots much so far they are all that I have learned to expect from DANNER", "Well made boots, very good fit for me.

My jungle boots in Vietnam were size 10. Over the years I increased to 10 1/2 but they began to cramp my feet.

I like the boot in every other respect and will continue to use the boot, but only with my dedicated, stained socks.", "I use size 11.5 but your recomendation was to choose 12 wich I did.

I will stick to made in USA redwings", "Comfort is key and they are great exactly what I needed", "These boots really felt flimsy and cheap compared to the others I tried (Lowa Renegades, Keen Oregon). Lowa's were much more expensive and Keen were actually less expensive due to great sell on Amazon. But the Danners just did not feel very sturdy. The laces were loose and seemed cheaply made. Support not near as good as the Keen or Lowa. Comfort not as good as the Keen or Lowa. Disappointed in the Danners but love the Keen Oregon.

Someone dropped a piece of apricot on the shoe so I had to wipe it with water right away. The area I washed looks darker when it dried. There is no dirty spot from fruit juice. The color is just darker now. So I wiped both boots with water entirely and now they are same darker color. BTW, I like the new color :) So maybe spray them with suede protector before going out.", "This is my go to boot that seems to go with anything (bought the dark stone color). It looks like a mix between taupe and gray. It fits just perfect! I wear a size 8 normally and that's what I ordered. I can even wear a thin sock with them.

Right out of the box they are soft and supple, and despite some of the reviews stating that they run narrow, I didn't find that to be the case. I ordered in my usual size (8) and in medium width they are perfect for my 'sometimes needs a wide width' foot. There does, however, seem to be an extra bit of room at the toe, so perhaps I could have gone with a 7 1/2 instead. Either way, I'm very happy with them.", "I thought these looked nice in the photos, but they're even better in person! The leather is so soft, and I've been able to wear them without socks with no risk of blisters. Love the zippers on each side, and the perforation will make these a great option for warmer days. Also, the heel isn't too tall, so they're comfortable to wear as a more casual boot than some of my others. I got the dark stone color, but am tempted to buy the black ones, too.", "These are great spring fall boots. The fit is a little odd for me-I have a somewhat narrow or maybe thin foot. There is room for a very thick sock which I will never wear. I usually take a 7, Length is good just maybe because the material is soft and flexible it feels a bit bulky?

I ordered the 8.5 but need this in an 8 so I have to send this one back. Hope they have an 8 in this as it's a very cute shoe. Looks great with jeans and capris. I love the color, it can be worn with just about anything. I was pleased that this shoe felt pretty comfortable.

However, the comfort level is not the highest. They are very flat and hard at the bottom and my bunions do not love using them all day. I think the leather will stretch and soon I will be better in width. They are super cute. But I know I do not want to walk all day in them!", "I got size 6 color Bisque due to the lowest price comparing with other color. It is a comfortable boot; and it is also good for warm weather because of leather upper features large perforated detail throughout. The air can get into the boot in warm weather. The Heel Height: 1 1\u20442 inches is right height for me. I am glad to find this kind of boot I was looking for.", "I purchased this boot as an on-trend alternative to my work shoes. I ordered an 8.5 wide because I knew I could add insoles if they were a bit loose, and I plan to wear thin black socks with them. I'm very pleased. I chose the dark stone - similar to a nice gray. They are going to look nice with dress work pants or with jeans. I think they're appropriate year-round. You do slightly see your sock fabric beneath the holes, so dark socks or black hose will look fine.", "These booties are so cute. You can wear them with jeans in the fall.

Very comfortable and I wear a sock with them. Did not see sock through the holes either. So happy with them. I wear 8 to 81/2 in most shoes. The 8 fits great with a sock. Probably a bit to big w/o sock.", "Second pair and I love these! No socks ! They are so comfortable and I can walk a country mile in these boots.", "I had to send back unfortunately they were too large at the end of the toes. Cute color and well made.

Looks gray sometimes and tan others, depending on what is worn.", "Not as cute in person. I personally didn't like the way they looked on my feet. They fit, but it felt like the open-hole leather would give too much and ultimately make them feel too big. Had to return.", "Love. I have a high arch and there is adequate room through that area. Toe box could be a little more roomy but not bad. The design with the holes help keep my feet cool so I\u2019m excited to be able to wear in the summer months. Color is a little more stone than grey, or maybe like a warm grey, not a cool or blue undertone.", "Many, many compliments. Shoes are great, good looking and comfortable right out of the box, even with my high arches. Also cool from perforations, nice change from sandals. Even non-shoe type persons and strangers have complimented.", "They feel like slippers. The leather is a good quality, the zippers are excellent not that flimsy kind that you know in a few tugs it will break. I will be putting my own insole, I want to enjoy them all winter.

They are see through, so be mindful of that.", "Okay, Lucky runs narrow and small in my experience so I learned from past experiences to buy in a half size up and then they are perfect fit.

I am getting older and it's all about comfort now, but I still want to be stylish and these fit the bill. I wear a size 6 and ordered a size 6 and they fit prefect--so true to size.

These boots are incredibly comfortable and durable. The steel-toe doesn't obstruct my toes in any way, but keeps them safe and sound whenever something is dropped on them (happens more often than it should). I recommend these boots to all of my colleagues, as they meet our shops standards, are comfortable and durable, and are pretty stylish for protective/anti-slip footwear. Highly recommend these boots to any laborers, or just someone looking for an awesome pair of boots.", "Definitely tight in the toes which had me very worried for the first 5 days but the padding self corrected and they fit fine. Tough on my feet when I walk on concrete floors all day. I upgraded the insoles by buying some sturdy foam flip flops for $2, cutting them to size and belt sanding them for appropriate thickness. Not a normal thing to do but the thick foam sure beats the stick insoles that came with these boots or those $15 \"work\" insoles at the store. Anything to save my heels when I'm tromping around on unforgiving concrete for 10 hours a day.", "These are the worst boots I have ever worn. Poorly crafted and poorly designed. The clasps which hold the ankle flection point cut my ankle because they were not filled down flush with the rest of the upper boot. Hard pass on this style.

I wear a 10.5M boot in every other work boot i've ever purchased, including a pair of steel toe work sneakers from timberland. Harley, Irish Setter, and Caterpillar boots I've always worn a 10.5. This, however is not the reason for 3 stars.

Would not buy again. Would not recommend. Printed a return label as soon as I could", "Bought this shoes for my brother and he loved it! The material his very resistant, he felt comfortable and mostly support has he works for landscaping and some construction and the steel toe was a must this protects him from any injuries has we never know something falls on your toe it am cause you to loose days of work so this was honestly a great investment . Great quality, full support and it\u2019s comfortable to work in.", "These boots looks really great if you're not too close... once you have them in front of your eyes you can tell that the quality control in these boots is the best. There are a lot of seam threads and scratches on the leather. The moment I took them out of the box I notice that the boots looked pretty small, and I was not wrong. I always use 41 and these ones felt like 39, I tried them removing the insole and using an finer one but it didn't help at all. Also, the boots are way to heavy. I decided to returned and buy a composite toe boots instead. More comfortable and way much lighter.", "Bought the steel toe version and had to return them because the toe box was too small and these were unwearable for me. I have big, wide feet and need space in the toe area to be comfortable. I speculate that the \"steel toe\" portion is not made specifically for each size (as a money saving manufacturing strategy) and thus fit will depend on the shoe size ordered. Bought boots from another manufacturer in the same shoe size that were dramatically more comfortable out of the box. These Timberlands might have been OK if they didn't have steel toes.", "SIZE WARNING! These boots run SMALL. I normally wear a 9.5 Medium width. In these shoes it took a 10.5 WIDE to fit my foot. I couldn't even get the 9.5 on my foot, so I returned them. Ordered the 10.5 Wide and they are perfect! The quality of this shoe is top of the line. everything thing about it is quality. Love these. Steel Toe works great. You can drop a brick on it and feel nothing. Soles are strong and flexible. The leather is wonderful. Worth every dime.", "I have reviewed these previously but needed to update the review. After wearing these for almost 7 months i can say that they are pretty comfortable. tHowever a thick pair of socks must be worn or the side walls near your ankles will rub against them. The area near my ankles is where a few peices of the leather come together and create a painful rubbibg experience. I learnt the lesson the hard way while wearing them a few days straight with thinner socks.

HOWEVER, these boots have saved my feet from injury on numerable occasions.

Nothing's better after a long day on your feet, to come home and swiftly pop your boots off. They aren't terribly comfortable. I wear insoles always but it still doesn't cover up the hard soles of these boots. That being said, these feel indestructible. I feel like I can kick through a wall with these bad boys.

He has always worn Timberlands and was wondering why they stopped sewing them and went to glue that doesn't last. Anyway, I decided to look at my favorite place (Amazon), and found these Timberlands that had sewed soles. I purchased one pair to make sure. When they were what we were looking for, I ordered another pair.", "This was a gift for my husband as he works construction and these are said to be great for those conditions. They did the job but after about 3 months or so my husband got really bad blisters on his feet because of the shoes. He\u2019s a supervisor at a construction site so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s on his feet 24/7 but I was hoping that it wouldn\u2019t happen as I read other reviews. Sadly, it did so I\u2019m currently looking to purchase another brand.", "I can\u2019t stand these shoes. Not only is the toe box too tight, there is ZERO arch support leading to numb feet at the end of a day. These are the worst shoes I\u2019ve ever purchased and I missed the return window by one day. $100 in the trash because I\u2019ll never wear these again. Update 3/2/20 - Amazon came through and let me return these. I stand by what I said though, these boots were very uncomfortable, even after trying to break them in.", "Had these a couple of months now, and have been pretty impressed. I have a little wider foot, so I got a wide boot. Usually this means the boot is a little loose, and makes my feet sore. These boots fit pretty good from the start, there was some wear points on the back of my heel I could feel the first day or so, but that has gone away now. I find myself continuing to wear these after I get home and forget I even have boots on still. With my last pair, I would kick them off almost soon as got in the house.", "These boots were comfortable right out of the box! A generous toe box is critical on a steel toe boot, and these are just right. Plenty of room for a thick pair of socks with my size 13 boots. The soles provide good support, and don't pick up too much mud when you are working in the rain. Leather is a little softer than I expect in a work boot, but I suppose it is a pretty reasonable trade-off for not needing to \"break-in\" a new pair of boots.", "Very comfy, ounce you break them in! Some defects if you ask me. Sole is glued or however they attached the rubber of the sole together. It\u2019s not done correctly and is done botched. But other than that. Boots are holding up! Very comfortable when we on your feet for 12-14 hrs. Great for anything you put them threw. Just make sure to waterproof them before using. Bought these for the steel toe and comfort!!!", "I\u2019ve been buying these boots for my husband for four years now. He does package handling at UPS and walks about 12 miles a day... He has never complained about his feet hurting cause the shoes are so nice and supportive. He\u2019s had 100+ pound boxes fall on him and he comes out completely unharmed. They\u2019re the only shoes he\u2019s ever had that have lasted at least a year. All the others he\u2019s tried have gone down hill after a few months.", "the seller was great shipped and arrived on time. As for the boot when i first put them i thought they fine a little stiff but no big deal. So i put my toe protector i bought on. whoops my bad. the steel toe digs into your toes. Not even on my feet all day. Drive a Roll off truck. So in and out of the truck throughout the day. After a few hours its hard to walk. I would not recommend these boots. I would return them but I jumped the gun and put the toe protectors on.", "The quality of these Timberland boots is great. The steel toe does not intrude into the side or top of the toe space. The other boots I tried (I used Amazon Wardrobe for the order) had steel toe boxes that intruded into the toe area. I like knowing that I have the steel toes - not being reminded as I wear them that they have steel toes. The cut and shoelace anchos are designed to flex at the ankle, which supports normal walking without binding. Very comfortable and provide nice ankle support. They feel great right out of the box. I'd definitely buy again.", "I should have known to not purchase anything from this brand. I'd tried a few variations in-store at Academy - before going online to try for better fitting + wider shoes(They didn't have much stock at Academy - and awful staff). I say I should have known better, because even among the line-up of Timberland shoes - The size number on the box - has absolutely no meaning. That is, size isn't standardized between the shoes this company offers. (Going by tongue tag) YMMV - good luck getting a shoe that fits.", "These boots are so durable, this is my 3rd pair (I buy a new pair every year) I have a very tough dirty job and these boots just fit the bill, I work in the trucking industry and road construction field and jump in and out of my semi too many times a day to count so these boots take a beating every day and are so comfortable for my size... Im 6 ft tall, wear a size13 boot and weigh 300 lbs", "These were a perfect fit. Very snug and great heel support. Not too heavy for a steel toe. It's a boot so expect a boot weight but not over the top. I've not had any problems with the lacebrivets popping out or bending. I tighten but don't over tighten. I received them in perfect condition so no marking or scuffing. The thing I like most about these boots is the comfort. They don't need much of a break in period when first worn but after a week or so they are top notch. I love how my heel has a pad underneath and how padded they are. I will now be a dedicated on going Timberland Pro boot consumer.", "I bought these boots for my husband for work back in 2016. Being a fabricator, he spends about 10 hours on his feet a day so we needed something that was comfortable but also wouldn't make him sore or tired. I'm proud to say that we just retired those boots (2020). Mind you, they weren't beautiful in the end but they held up for almost 4 years of rough and tough wear and tear! I purchased a pair for myself for work and winter. A bit bulky for a woman but my feet were always cozy and protected. Overall, we loved our purchase and will continue to purchase in the future.", "These shoes feel like I\u2019m wearing wooden or steel clogs. I can\u2019t believe that timberlands feel like this. I usually have to wear my water boots all day because they feel icy better than these. I can almost feel the steel toe rubbing against toes. They also rub uncomfortable against my heel. You\u2019d think this means I bought a size too small but it\u2019s not. I have enough space in the shoes to move around. They\u2019re good as long as I\u2019m not walking. Timberland needs to do better", "My experience with these boots. Horrible. They hurt my feet so bad that I had to have my girlfriend go buy a pair of boots at walmart and bring them to me . A $30 pair from there is more comfortable than these. They tear my heels up. Like so sore I can barley walk. I work in a factory doing shipping and receiving. I take about 23,000-25,000 steps a day. Literally the worst boot I have ever owned. Not even a 2nd thought about it. I have owned them about 2 weeks, not only do they hurt but they are starting to fall apart.", "There is no insert that will help give you any comfort at all unless you're flat footed. I had to buy a Dr Sholl's Gel insert to feel comfortable. Aside from that it's a great boot, looks great, but for the price, they should have an insert that actually does something. They have this thin rubber like insert that does nothing at all......The rest of the boot is great, looks good but don't expect to stand all day in them....", "The shoe would be perfect except for 2 inexcusable quality failures: The seam in the back rubs against my ankle and irritates it. That's through boot socks and everything 4 days in currently and one of the bootstraps just ripped off. I like the look and feel for the most part but this is my second pair of timberland pros and both had stupid missteps. Being in an industry that strongly values quality control, this is inexcusable and this will be my last pair. I wanted to like these so bad.", "I got these from the amazon bargain bin. So they were lightly used. Im just having some break in issues. Toe box a little tight, and my foot is still reshaping the shoe. a little loose on the heal but not too bad. I kinda like thinner socks so I'll wear a thicker sock to compensate. Feels sturdy on loose rock, good on the ladder, no problem when driving the truck, a little slick on wet surfaces like wet wood.", "Love the looks and the design of these boots. They feel comfortable and sturdy and are extremely comfortable. I had recently broken my big left toe and these boots made it feel extremely protected and at the right position like a tailored case. For work boots, they are extremely beautiful. Update- Since this purchase I bough another very nice and very good looking boots that are actually my number one good looking boots, but these ones are still amazing good looking, comfortable and make me feel secure doing my job.", "Let me share my new experience with Timberland Pro, with you. I am 55 years old, I spend lots of time at work, sometimes, 18 hours/day for 60 days. I've been through many work shoes brands, they all are great product, but Timberland Pro, is an other different way to match the needs of your feet to support your whole body weight .Timberland Pro, gives my feet what they need to keep me working all the day with a great comfort. I'll stick with it.", "I bought these boots January of 2018. Close to 2.5 years and they\u2019re still in great shape. They\u2019re sturdy and reasonably comfortable. They\u2019re on the heavier side but that\u2019s common with work boots. I have fa complaints with these. First, the steel toe rubs against my big toe and if I don\u2019t wear thick wool socks it gets very irritating. Second, the lace hooks popped off within a few months. I just use the holes where the rivets were as lacing holes now.", "Great high quality boot that lasted almost 3 years before I purchased them again, that's right I loved them that much that I purcgased them again. At the $100 price you can't go wrong. I vouch for these boots. They are available in wide sizes also which is a plus, very comfy and can take a beating!!!", "The shoes were purchased for extended walking in a large indoor/outdoor plant facility - several hundred acres, about 8 miles/day for several weeks. The brand was recommended by a trusted manager. Overall, I'm satisfied with these shoes. Two comments: 1). They have to be \"broken in.\" I don't know whether they broke me in or whether I broke them in. Expect at least a week for this. 2). Wearing thick socks is mandatory - expect slippage (+ pain) if thin socks are worn.", "Really good boot, i started working in a warehouse and i needed boots, this do the job. when i first put then on i felt the steel toe crashing with my pinky toe, i thought it was going to be painful but i was wrong. One bad side to this boots is the comfort. am used to tennis shoes, sadly this boots feel too uncomfortable, i work 10 hour shifts with them and when leaving my feet hurt a lot. I recommend buying other insoles for them.", "For a boot sub $100 it's not bad. It's what I would call a summer boot. It only lasted 1 full season here in Colorado. The rain and snow soak through the boot pretty quick. If you only use this boot in the summer it might last you a couple seasons. It's a comfortable boot with very little break in time.", "Reviewing the Timberland PRO Men's 6\" Pit Boss Steel-Toe work boot. Out of the box they seemed fine; I wore them around the house without problem. But as I wore the boots for yard work, they seemed to fit worse and worse. It feels like there are metal parts between the layers of leather, biting into my feet. I tried different socks, carefully re-tying, etc. Nothing helped, and I ended up with a huge blister on the back of my heel. I surrender, I'm sending them back.", "At first I did not like them at all. They were very uncomfortable. I have arches in my feet and they did not support at all. But how I fixed this was I bought some insoles. And that totally fixed the pains. For those who need EH boots, then these are it. It doesn't say on the description. So I thought I'd help out those I've gone through several different shoes found these. Even gone to the orthopedic store.. There are great ONLY if you get insoles if you have arches. Flat feet might not matt iner.", "Bought these for work standing on concrete floors all day. Not as comfortable as I hoped they would be, but not dis-comfortable either. I get foot pain fairly easily after 8 years in the infantry so it is very hard for me to find a great boot that doesn't cost a lot of money. Overall not a bad boot for the money. Way better than my previous (Wolverine) work boots that cost nearly twice as much.", "These hurt really bad, I had to buy new souls and they still hurt. There is this super hard plastic piece in the that hold the arches of your feet up and I'm flat footed and it felt like it was moving the bones in my feet around. 2nd they ended up falling apart around the sole after a month. My shoes before this I bought at sports academy and they were 70 bucks and lasted 6 months and the soles were some weird foam. Tim's is going down hill.", "I bought these boots as a present for my mechanic boyfriend. He's constantly in and out in the weather, so boots that could hold up in the shop and outside were important. After reading reviews for ten other boot options, I decided to go with the Tim's and we were not disappointed! My boyfriend really likes the boots. He think they are comfortable, durable and easy to take on and off without having to untie the laces all the way. He's already been out in the mud with them and they have held up great so far. For the price, these are a wonderful choice. I can tell these will last him a long time.", "I got these boots as a birthday gift for my husband. They arrived a day earlier which was great. He opened them and loved them right away. He tried them and was very pleased. The price was really great. They fit his foot perfectly. He said his other timberlands are still going strong. He is a bricklayer so his boots are very important to him. The steel toe is great and the boot fits like a boot not a box. His words. There very comfortable being on his feet all day. He truly loves these boots. We will buying more.", "I wore these for 3 days and couldn't take the pain anymore. Even with thicker insoles, it still didn't help. Good looking boot (extra star for that only) but just so disappointed in the comfort. It was like walking barefoot on concrete so I had no choice but to return them. I got the Timberland Pro Titan 26078 instead and OMG, night and day difference. If you want comfort, go with the Titans. Worth the extra money.", "These are made as well as you might imagine. My main beef is they are just too narrow around the big toe/ball of foot. I have a fairly narrow fit so I'm kinda surprised. They are made well and may fit you just fine but the main reason I wouldn't buy them again is they just aren't comfortable. I've had them a while now and they just never really broke in. I don't really know how to rate them. .. just give three stars to be neutral.", "I never experienced this before, and I expected more consistency and Berger quality assurance from a name like Timberland, but the right boot is much tighter in the toe area than the left. These are steel toe, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019d wear in over time. Very uncomfortable just trying on the right boot. Didn\u2019t even walk in them! Th is is the problem with buying clothes online.", "Break in period took some patience. After a year of use... and replacing the insoles a few times.... I wouldn\u2019t buy them again, but this was the first time buying work boots like this. (Everyday use) Pro: -Price -foot protection -water resistant -leather holds up Con: -shoe laces constantly come untied (had to double knot and would sometimes still come loose from the hooks). -water resistant (small puddles were a challenge). -none leather material doesn\u2019t hold up well.", "My son had wanted a pair of these Timberland PRO Men's Pit Boss Steel-Toe boots for a while, and finally decided to spend the money and order a pair. He really liked them initially. However, after only 17 days of wearing them, one of the hook eyelets popped out (see photo). That is pretty poor quality for the price; I\u2019m just glad it happened during the return window. We will be sending these back and buying a different brand.", "I work on steep hillsides with a chainsaw and machete, clearing brush; I weigh over 300 lbs and have had trouble finding boots that would keep up with me for more than a few months before the eyelets tear out or the sole separates from the upper. I ordered and tried on 8 different brands of steel-toed boots before sticking with these - and I am glad I did. I had to get one size bigger than I usually wear due to the unforgiveness of the steel toe area, but that's not unusual for me. I've had them 6 months now and they are still going strong! Thank you, Timberland!", "Receive my boots on Wednesday, and put a couple coats of obenauf's and one coat of kiwi shoe shine for a nice sheen on the boot . I work in tire sales and so I try to keep my stuff clean and shiny and now we have to have steel toes so this is the first boot I bought that I found in the size 15 W . I'm on my feet 8 hours a day on concrete so I'll see how they perform and if there's any downsides I'll come back and review the boot", "Just under the right ankle there is a slight protursion from the boot so that each time I take a step, it jams into that spot causing pain and causing red area on the skin. They are very well made and otherwise fine boots but this issue makes them unwearable. I bought them a while ago but only tried using them recently when the weather turned but now probably too late to return and worn a few times trying to make them work. Note this even happens right through the heaviest of sock. Lesson: Try them on and use them immediately upon receiving.", "I ordered 6 pairs of steel toe boots to try on and these were the most uncomfortable - very stiff. But they look nice so they got an extra star. And the Timberland Titans were the most comfortable FYI.", "These eat your heels like Kobayashi eats hot dogs. After 2 weeks of working in a warehouse, I can barely walk thanks to the hard plastic or metal or whatever they decided to put at the back of the heel. Weirdly, I was fine for the first few days. Now I am limping around the house with almost no skin on the backs of my ankles. I've tried them with 2 different (top rated) insoles to see if that somehow fixed the fit. It didn't. Bought a half size bigger and have to use heel inserts still for protection. That said they are great for your toes.", "The quality looks very good. It is quite heavy. It is made in The Dominican Republic. I ordered Size11.5 (1/2 size bigger) based on many reviews. Wide Size is slight smaller than normal Wide size for sport shoe like Nike. Adding 1/2 size (0.21 inch) or next size bigger turned out correct because the steel toe cover taken space and the leather is not so flexible. The best reason is because our feet will also expand when we work. So you need to buy Wide Size for the shoe and if you present size is marginal, you really need the next size bigger.", "After a couple months of light use, showing some signs of wear. They are comfortable, although I only wear them to school usually where I am studying auto tech and the leather has some spots showing wear already even though I\u2019ve mostly been sitting in a classroom", "Awesome work boot. 2.5 years of use in the maintenance industry and the only thing that recently broke was a shoe lace. They are a bit narrow at the toes, so if you have an above average foot width, the standard size will probably not be too comfortable. No problems at the heel with mine as some have mentioned. I could see how there is if you don't back your foot into the boot and tie it properly. So just wear them right and these will last you. Excellent bang for the buck. Highly recommend.", "I purchased these Timberland work boots hoping that the 8.5 W would fit my wide feet. Unfortunately the Wide designation really means Medium fit. I can't imagine how tight a Medium would be. I really wanted these to fit as the product seem really well made. Bummed that I had to send them back and purchase a brand where \"Wide\" means wide.", "These are the most uncomfortable boots I have ever worn. I wear a size 9.5 in every shoe/boot I own and these feel like I\u2019m wearing a size 8. Especially in the steel toe box my pinky toe is literally pushed under my other toes. I exchanged the 9.5 for a 9.5 Wide(I have really narrow feet) and they still don\u2019t fit. I have never even worn these outside of my living room and I am unable to return them since I\u2019m past the 30 days. Now I\u2019m stuck with worthless shoes.", "I liked the leather and the fit. Small seem in the back near the heal that if the shoes are worn tightly it rubs against your ankle. I just loosened the shoe a bit.(less ankle support but no heel pain).", "I am not one to rate things just after I have received them so After 1 month and 1 week of wearing these work boots and lacing them up every morning one of the quick lacing rivets pulled out, the metal ring is still on the inside of the boot. This rivet job was poorly done will not buy this brand again and do not recommend.", "Wore it two times already.At first it felt tight but loosened up very quickly Probably because the leather stretched and now it fits well even with my bunions at the sides of my feet And my feet did not hurt even though I stand all day at my job.Second time I wore them in constant rain and it took a lot of constant rain before water got in the boots. Did not give it a five star because I only wore it two times I need time to see how it perform in the long run.", "Previously had a pair of these 7 or 8 years ago and got a solid 2 years out of them between a shop and construction site environment. Have since tried more expensive boots with mixed results and ordered another pair because for $86 you can\u2019t beat them. They are a little clunky but pretty much indestructible...will be curious to see how much this pair holds up in a purely construction environment. The leather molds well to your foot and the boots are pretty comfortable. I did swap out the factory insoles for some $12 Dr. School\u2019s but I do that with all my boots.", "Near perfect boot, only worn them a week so far but they fit and feel sooo much better than old pair of $40 boots. They have amazing grip, I feel very stable walking on oiled metal doors, my old boots had me falling and slipping. The support in the boot feel great, I am 300lb plus and they feel extremely comfortable. Only issue I have so far is due to my weight I'll assume, I did need to add an Dr Scholls insert because something was digging into me near my heel. Will update with any issues.", "I have owned Timberland Boots for 10 years, the last pair I bought from Sears and it said guaranteed to fit or return in 30 days. I was a very happy customer they were comfortable on day one. These Boots I thought by the look were the exact same ones and I bought the wide size to ensure comfort. These boots are stiff and hurt my ankles and the steel toe hurts my big toe, I want to return them but I am on the fence about returning them because it is so hard to buy boots online and know they will be right.", "I originally bought these boots for my boyfriend because the brand he had previously been purchasing started having a downgrade in product quality. When my boyfriend got them he said the boots were a perfect fit. He does have size 12 feet and they are slightly flat. However, the boots didn\u2019t quickly go ragged and held up pretty well. He has had them about 6 months and other then obvious cosmetic differences from working in them the structure of the boots is still firm. (He does flooring for work)", "These replaced my Timberland steel toe Pro boots I had for motorcycle riding for probably 15 years which finally got rubber rot in the soles. The new ones are smaller, narrower and lighter than the originals I had and had to try 3 times to get the fit right. I ended up with a 1/2 size larger and a wide to get the same fit I got on the old boots and also this is the pit boss so slightly different style. I like this boot. Comfortable and lighter than the original making walking around easier. I think it's a quality boot.", "I wear this pair of shoes working on my farm and I ABUSE them. Wore them the first day all day long and every day ever since, so very pleased that break-in was a non-issue. Very comfortable! I did add some extra insoles, but other than that, they went to work straight out of the box and haven't missed a beat yet. I would buy these again.", "One of the most comfortable boots once broken in. For me it's almost 2 weeks but other co workers it was nothing. NOTE!!!!: You have to buy the timberline rubber insoles sold separately otherwise there is no support. Def worth the 30 extra dollars. And the timberline long socks work perfect for any work boot. Breathe well, not too thick, and very comfortable. I work 60 hrs a week as a mechanic so at that rate expect to get a little less than a year each time since I'm rough on them. Also, the insoles that u buy separate have to be cut to your size but not hard to do. Just use a pair of scissors.", "I think its a good price for this boot especially after getting by with the cheap walmart version for so many years. but I did add an extra insert before I ever wore them which does make the inside height closer to my feet, no rough seem rubbing my ankle anywhere, but on the second day i did over tighten the laces which did make my ankle soar, but loosened them the next day and it was back to being comfortable.", "I've brought this exact boot model for the last ten years. i add an upgraded insole now as all the factory ones can be improved upon. The boot is rugged, comfortable for my feet, and they last in a construction environment. They are the best for me!", "Figuring they would be pretty nice. Maybe it's just my feet, but they seem to run a little large. They're kinda heavy. But most important, they seriously dug into the back of my heel. Like, unreasonably dug. I didn't want to take the chance to see if they might break in after awhile. I don't think they would have. I've seen other reviews about this problem and they're correct.", "Heavy Duty - love 'em. These are 'better' than the standard Timberland boot everyone else is wearing. Heavy duty, more support in the arch and foot bed, thicker/taller sole and nicely padded tongue. I sprayed waterproofing spray on these and they didn't discolor. They are heavy, but that's what I'd expect with a steel toe. Great with jeans, though they're 'bigger' than the bottoms of your standard jean - you'll want 'boot cut'... depending on the look you want. Overall good boot and good work boot. Barely feel uneven surfaces underneath.", "For like a glove. Comfortable and warm so far this winter. Great boot for the NW. Subject to boiler ash and landfill mud daily. Did require short break in period. One of the lace hooks did separate. Remedied the issue with a dab of 5 min epoxy. Would buy again regardless of issue.", "I bought the same boot 2 years ago. These are hurting my ankle a bit, but I'll get over it. New boots, especially work boots are tough as nails and need a break in period. Period! These are very durable. I see in my boots and only the right boot, the heel mis sewn, I hope that doesn't cause issues. But, they will break in, blisters or not. They're new and stiff, and I wouldn't wear anything else. These boots are tough. I walk between 1 mile and 10 miles a day. I wear them because I have too. Give them the time they need to break in and they'll keep your feet safe and sound for years to come.", "These were surprisingly more comfortable than expected. In my job, sometimes I'm running around and sometimes I'm working with heavy things. I thought I was going to have to get a pair for each. But thanks to Timberland, it's just one pair! Another thing. I tried name brand shoes designed specifcally for walking all day. And then I switched back to these. Guess which one was more comfortable? These are more supportive for walking/running around than some actual walking shoes. Just wow.", "My second pair of timberlands. I ordered wide and they are a wide fit not as wide as the boondocks. Very rugged boot. The only down side of these boots is it has a hard nylon sole/base and a very thin open cellfoam insoles not like my other timberlands that had the awesome anti fatigue insole. So if you order these i suggest getting a set of good insoles. Boots are worth the money", "After seeing so many good reviews for these foods I became excited to try them out for myself. At first, I was happy how they turned out but after about 3 months I became disappointed in these boots has the treads are starting to fall off. They're very comfortable after you break them in but I wouldn't expect them to last very long if you work 8 plus hours on concrete or steel floors.", "I ordered these boots to use working on barges to replace my expensive red wings that were out . The boots are very sturdy , waterproof and well made . But there is very little or zero arch support, and my feet hurt quickly. I have had them for several months , terrible uncomfortable for walking on steel for hours , feet hurt", "I only wear these boots a couple days a week, tops and I have never had any issues with this brand until this pair of boots. I have two of the eyelets are misaligned and causing the laces to wear out to soon. ALSO I have an eyelet that has torn completely of the boot and wanted to know what I can do. They are still in great looking shape as well as the sole being in good shape. I rotate my shoes all week long depending on the weather and my working conditions. I would like to return these for another pair if that is possible. Thank you, T. Graves!", "These boots are great. This is my second pair. My first I had for over a year and a half, and the only reason I replaced them is because the soles where worn down. I work in a steel fabrication shop and these boots get beat up daily. There really is no break in period with these boots either. They are comfortable the minute you put them on. I would highly recommend them to everyone", "Compared to my other boots, these are better. Lighter and more cushion, so I don\u2019t get the hard impact with each step. Less noisy when walking on hard surfaces. No hot spots and fast break in. More grip on wet surfaces. The insole it came with is junk, so buy a better one. The stitching around the tongue and ankle area was not great. Now let\u2019s see how long they last?????", "I purchased these boots based on the good reviews and was not disappointed. I ordered my first pair to the size I normally wear and they were too small. Just enough that I knew they would hurt my feet at the end of the day. I returned the first pair and ordered a half size larger pair...and am I glad I did. Like all shoes/boots, they needed a little break in time. It took about a week and they were like molded to my feet. If they last as long as a lot of the reviews said they would, I'll be wearing these a long time.", "This boots are killing my heels. I work on the RV industry, I walk a lot, my shifts are 8-10 hours and this is the second par of timberland boots I've had, I was happy with the first pair, they had composite toe protection (they were lighter) and this time I decided to go for a different style but I'm really dissatisfied with my choice, this boots are to heavy and if I lace'em up to the top they hurt my ankle, they are not comfortable at all...", "I normally wear a 12 EEE. I can usually wear a 12EE in boots, which these were, but these were way too tight. I ended up returning them and buying a 13 Wide(EE) which is just right for my feet. I am very happy with the 13s, so my advice is to buy up. I'm happy with everything else, they were just on the small side.", "I bought size 15 wide. They weren\u2019t at wide as other shoes I\u2019m used to, but definitely one of the comfiest pairs of boots. I have arches a bit on the high side, so the insoles sucked royally. Once I got a new pair of better quality insoles in everything was great. I\u2019m on my feet about 9-10 hours a day in a cold shop and these kept my feet nice and warm. They took about a week of constant wear to break in.", "1st shift and my feet were blistered. No way enough comfort. I did not have the luxury of buying a stretcher and taking a day to loosen them up. If a guy needs work boots, they have to be able to use immediately. Gave it a 2 star. So frustrated I might drop that to a 1.", "These are pretty decent boots, comfortable and seem to be holding up well. My only complaint is that I have lost a couple of the hooks for the laces. One caught the edge of a ladder and fell out, and the other just disappeared one day walking around outdoors. The hooks don't seem to be very robust. The last 5 or so pairs of work boots I've owned are a different brand, and I've never lost a single hook.... but they are also more than 2X the price of these boots. So, for the price difference, I can get these repaired and still be ok with it.", "In less than two months one of the top hooks poped off. I still carried on,as they were some what comfortable. if you work days longer then six hours I highly advise you getting an insole,other wise your feet will hurt. Also within the third month the anti slip wore through, so these can't be used as work boots anymore,they look nice though. I've used timberland boots since I was 12, i think these will be my last pair of work boots from this company,sadly.", "These are NOT American sizes. They run at least ONE size too small and ONE size too Narrow. I don't even have wide feet and they are too narrow but the width is \"EE\"!! These must be a shipment meant for a country of people with tiny feet. If you wear a size 9 buy a size 10 double EE Width! It's crazy. I'm returning them.", "I had to use a foam insole and a gell insole in each boot to make the boot comfortable for my feet but the problem now is the pressure points all around the ankles. I don\u2019t know if they will get better in time but I can\u2019t put up with the pain! I\u2019m going back to Docs even though their quality has gone way downhill but they are like putting your feet into a cloud, especially compared to these Timberland boots!", "One boot is larger than the other. It feels like I\u2019m wearing two different boots. Update. So I returned the first pair and got a second pair and although one boot is still a little bit bigger if they are much better.", "I am so pleased with these boots. I use them riding my motorcycle (Suzuki C 50 Boulevard) and it is a very well built boot that gives me the protection I need against the elements. They are super comfortable and really no -break in time. I usually wear a size 9 D but I took a chance and purchased the 9.5 E. With my thick socks it fits perfectly. I will purchase another set but in black to match my riding suit. Very well made.", "After having a terrible experience with a different brand of boots, I decided to give these a try. I've only been wearing them 2 days so far. I work a 10 hour shift standing on my feet the majority of the day, and I must say...these boots are great! Right out of the box they felt leaps and bounds better than any other steel toe boot I've worn. The insoles that come with them actually have comfort and support. Which is very rare. For the price, these are a steal. They're comfortable and stylish. You most likely won't regret buying these.", "My last work boots were a pair of dr martens steel toe with internal net guards and I ordered the same size as those but these are really small. I should have gotten a size larger then I normally wear. I\u2019ve worn them for a week now and they seem decent in every other aspect then sizing is off. I\u2019d buy them again but a size larger then I\u2019m use to.", "Why do manufacturers keep redesigning flawless products? Something happened in the production transition from 'then' to 'now' where the heel and toe have been modified to irritate me. These don't sit right. And now that I've worn them, I'm not going to return them. I'll just deal with the feet that turn white.", "I have been wearing Timberland Pro Pit Boss work boots for two decades now. They take polish nicely if you saddle soap them as soon as you get them. These boots are well built, extremely comfortable, nice looking and will last a long time. My first 2 pairs each lasted 2 seasons of asphalt laboring which is very hard on boots. Keep the leather polished with regular kiwi and they will serve you for years.", "Can't tell you how much money and time I've wasted on shoes that were suppose to be extremely wide. People in China who make them just can't comprehend the size of an American male's foot. I'm currently wearing an extra wide steel toe industrial tennis shoe made by New balance that almost fits. My big toe's have blisters on them but I wrap them in tape to help with the rubbing until I can find and afford to take a risk on buying another pair that \"claim\" to be Extremely wide. Good luck on your search!", "Does not run true to size. I always wear size 10W or 10.5 and when they arrived they were too narrow (I got size 10.5). The quality seems good, and I was about to reorder a slightly bigger size but the price increased by almost 20%. Decided to go with a different brand.", "**Update** While the 13s do fit better, they certainly don't feel any better.. Nothing but pain around the ball of my feet.. The plastic sole seems warped and they are just plain uncomfortable. These could be defective but I really don't want to go through a 2nd exchange.. Just received them last night and I'm already returning.. While they look great and are probably great, these are NOT a size 12.. Feels like an 11.. Hopefully 13s fit better.. Will update when I receive my exchange.", "I purchased these for my son. He is a size 15w hard to find. He works in the insulation and silicone roofing field. I asked how they felt and his response was better then squeezing into dads size 13!! Its been a week now and he says they are a little heavy but comfortable and have really good traction. (That's important when on a roof)", "I hang sheetrock for a commercial contractor and bought these boot back in February of 2018. I liked the boots alot. They are comfortable and waterproof so as long you dont get water up near the shoelace holes. Great grip but unfortunately after 8 months of heavy use the tread doesnt keep me from slipping anymore. I might get 2 months tops with its current tread depth right now but needless to say worth the money. Im buying the boots again this next go around.", "Great boots, have had them for two weeks now and they have held up great so far. I'm a mechanic and tow truck driver so they get wet, get covered in dirt, grease and chemicals and they are doing great. I'm kinda flat footed so after 9 hours they get a lil stiff so I'd recommend arch supports. For the price tho can't beat it.", "The boots are well made. I usually wear new boots for short periods to break them in before trying to work in them all day. So far I have spent about 45 minutes walking around the house in them and they are already quite comfortable to wear. Fit was snug initially but the brief break in has loosened them up nicely. I can't offer any thoughts on durability yet but I'm looking forward to putting them to work this week doing some chainsaw work around the property. These already seem like a great pair of boots for the money.", "This is the second pair of these boots my husband ordered. When I went to order a new pair I was shocked tp see that his last pair lasted a full two years. This is amazing since he usually gets about six months of wear before he has to replace his boot regardless of brand or price point. These Timberland boots held up very well in a tough environment in a welding and fabrication shop where he\u2019s on his feet all day on concrete floors. Highly recommend.", "I have had these for about a week so far. They are pretty comfortable and pretty light for steel toe boots I think. I have taken my dog for several long walks and they didn't hurt my feet much. The heel is still breaking in but I am confident they will be fine. I have also worn them to work for a week and they are fine. I am standing a lot but not totally still and they did great. The insole is removable. It doesn't have as much cushion as the Timberland Endurance boots that I have been wearing for several years. So far they have had good traction on the smooth concrete floor where I work.", "The soles of the boots were hard and lumpy. I don\u2019t know if they would break in properly, but I am on my feet for 14 hours a day and don\u2019t have the luxury to take a chance on my feet. Gave a couple of stars because they are a great looking boot", "Great, durable work boots. I bought these for contract work in the middle east, and they hold up great. I wear them everyday (7 days a week) for about 14 hours. Would definitely recommend buying some better insoles along with these though.", "I bought these boots for work. The insole was the first to go, then an eyelet fell out. Overall they are decent boots but not the same quality that I have found with others. If you don't plan on wearing them for 40+ hours a week they might be the right choice for you.", "The boot is built well. Laces are a bit short. Good traction. But they run a half size small. I wear a size 10. Had to return them for a 10 1/2. Also one boot is taking the skin off the back of my heel. I can\u2019t seem to find any seam or anything that\u2019s doing it It\u2019s pretty smooth . Must be a harsh break in period.", "Bought these Timberland Pro Pit Boss with the Steel-Toe for summer landscaping and grounds work. I've worked in them every day for 6 weeks. I string trim and blade trim, work in mud, shovel dirt and stand on my feet all day. These have met my expectations and I feel they were worth the $. Hopefully they will last more than one summer.", "Will check back in after breaking them in. Initial Thoughts - Not the lightest boot I've ever worn, but easily the most industrial boot I've ever bought and worn too...So I'm no expert on the matter. These things fit very nice, a bit big in the toe box, but can't complain considering I've got some steel to protect my 5 little piggies in there. I'm anxious to get em dirty and get em working. Then we'll see how they hold up.", "My nephew bought these for work. He stands all day and likes to randomly dance when he\u2019s doing really good carpenter work. He says they\u2019re okayyyy, but not as comfortable as he thought they\u2019d be for a long day\u2019s work.. Might help if you\u2019re not a dancer AND worker like my nephew.", "Little big to size ( next time I'll order one size smaller). The eyelets at the top of the boot seem very strong. However, there is very little rom for the string to hook into the eyelet. This causes the shoestrings to slip out and ultimately results in many re-tying throughout the day. Oct 18. ( 1 week after return window closed) Lower eyelet pulled through, making a snug fit impossible. I wouldn't recommend this product if you plan on doing any real work in them", "Kinda crappy. Expected more for timberlands since they\u2019re so expensive, they said they were work boots (steel toe). I work at Walmart and pretty much two days after I got them them they got scratched and scuffed like crazy, I\u2019m definitely returning them. Also with original soles they are completely uncomfortable. But they do look nice", "Worn out after 3 months... are not breathable at all, the leather on the toe worn to pretty much nothing. Now granted I\u2019m HARD on shoes, but 3 months is ridiculous for $90! I can go to Walmart and get a $20 pair of boots if I only wanted them for 3 months", "Had to get a 1/2 size larger after ordering the first pair. The top of the steel toe sits low compared to other steel toed boots so it rubs a bit. My boyfriend has also developed some very thick calluses in strange parts of his feet that he has not gotten from other boots, he used to have Carolina boots. Overall though he likes them and would buy them again", "Gave me huge blisters on both feet first day wearing them. Working 10hrs a day 6 days a week and I stll have the same blisters for going on 3 weeks now. The place where it's stitched inside constantly rubs my ankles and is slowing down the healing process.", "Love these boots so far! Had to return the original due to a loose eyelet. But customer service was outstanding. They sent out the next pair immediately. Wasn\u2019t sure how comfortable they would be. Turns out they are very comfortable. I would recommend these if you are looking for a good work boot. I would buy them again!!", "These boots looked ok, but even though they were wide, I couldn\u2019t fit them on my foot. If your foot is narrow these would be ok I\u2019m sure. For me they did not work. I ended up returning these and bought a pair of Carolina work boots in a 4e and they are amazing!", "Been a long term user of this model from Tim. Average use was 530 am to 10 pm 6 to 7 days a week yes actually.....so much that kids would joke about the time spent in those boots and my feet never hurt most comfortableshoes ever found..... But I will say this theses just might be last pair and become flower pots in the garden.. My feet since new pair 3 weeks into them and my feet hurt that I bring sneekers to work to switch out daily after heavy work done. Defective pair or just changed quality??? I noticed first day they felt hard souled....", "I owned some timberlands for hiking and they are super comfortable so I thought definitely need some of these for work. Not even close to the same comfort level. Honestly like the worst boots I\u2019ve owned as far as comfort. Look great and I\u2019m sure they are durable but even changing out the insole barely made these boots tolerable.", "I like these a lot and plan to order another pair just like them except without the steel toe. The steel toe bothers me a bit on long days when I am walking a lot, but I think that is more of my weird foot than these boots.", "I got a defective pair. The ankle support is so out of place that i can feel it grinding against my heal... Going to try to fix it, but I am extremely disappointed It's been some time, and the crummy ankle support hasn't changed.", "I bought these boots to put on the shelf because I am afraid they will be discontinued by the time I need another pair. I had a pair in the past and they wore down in about a 1.5 years. I then bought redwings with a work allowance and the fit was no where as good as these timberlands, they never broke in, the timberlands are like house slippers to me. I have 13 wide feet. I will wear down the redwings due to cost, they do wear better but comfort is more important and I like these timberlands enough to put a spare pair on the shelf in the closet.", "I used Amazon's try-before-you-buy for this pair of boots. I needed a new pair of safety boots for work and I thought I would give these a try. After wearing the boots for several days, I committed to buy them. I am very pleased with their fit and overall comfort. I need to break them in a little longer, but I have no regrets with my purchase.", "Ordered a pair of boots and had to send back for a half size bigger. The return process was easy and refunded in a timely manner. Ordered replacement pair and are true to size and comfortable without requiring to be broken in! Highly recommend this seller and these boots!", "I wore these boots for a week to really feel how they broke in and after that time I started to develop a bad pain on outside of my right ankle. Can\u2019t return them cause I got them too dirty. Usually wear Irish setters and wanted to try something with a better tread however the upper on these boots are very uncomfortable. Also I could feel the steel toe plate poking through which was also uncomfortable on my toes. A week after going back to my usual boots I still have the pain there. Don\u2019t recommend.", "I've bought these boots the last several years with no problem. Something must have changed in manufacturing though cause it feel like Im walking without any support or cushion in the heels. Don't know what happened. Probably cost cutting like usual. Gonna go by some redwings or something else next time.", "This is my second go with these boots. Great for a name brand boot I work in machine shop on concrete all day I did have to purchase new Insoles but after that the boots worked great and I water proofed them but they do not hold up great in winter lasted about 9 months then time to buy a new pair", "A great safety boot, but I too have felt the infamous pinch/chafing of the rigid rear ankle support. Because I only use these boots when the situation happens to call for extreme safety protection, the slight discomfort does not bother me. I could not wear these, however, as a daily work boot due to the issue with the ankle", "This is one well built boot top quality the only reason I didn't give five stars was it fit to small for me I have been size 12 in shoes and boot since well allways long story short ordered a size 12 steel toe and they were just a bit to tight and I sent them back no size 12 1/2 so i was really sad to not be able to own a pair they were very well crafted do yourself a favor try these boots on local to ensure fit", "I buy these boots once every year or so and run them into the ground. For the price and how I treat them they are fantastic. I walk everywhere and work in construction, so they tend to get a work out. Typically 10-15 miles walked a day in these things and they easily last a year in good shape, and then another year as backup dirty work boots.", "I love these shoes. I wish the women's ones fit as well. I work on a shipping dock and sometimes have to make deliveries around the offices and these boats are great all around. I have also warn them outside when I do lawn work/gardening and they clean up well. I would definitely recommend these. I have had them for about about a year and they are holding up well. The only possible con to these is there is not a lot of arch support. I will be buying these again once these wear out. They are also light weight for steel toes, I had tried Cats and these are much better for me.", "I had never bought a pair of Timberland boots and since I needed a new pair I thought I would try a pair. Ended up returning them. They felt like they were a size smaller than the size I wore in all my shoes. That was ok, I figured a different brand and sizes do differ. But, the boot was so stiff, they had no give when I walked. So I returned them and continue to try different brands.", "The tongue dug into my right shin and the ankle seams hurt for a bit. I stuck with it and after a few days it got much better. This was especially so while driving. I just completed a long trip and have felt comfortable. The construction of these boots is pretty good. They look good. I'm happy with them overall now that I have worn them for a few days. They do take some getting used to. I just wonder why the pro line is priced lower and less comfortable than the field boot.", "I assemble large power transformers. These boots have broken in nicely during the last 3 months. They were awful on oil right out of the box, and now they are just bad, but have gotten a little better. They need to break in like all boots, so expect some blisters for a few days. They are holding up very well, and now they are pretty comfortable.", "Boots fit correctly but the inside plastic under the pad is raised up on the side and cuts into my foot. I didn't noticed until at work and took my boot off and my foot was bleeding. I haven't been able to wear them other than the one day and it was horrible.", "Excellent quality of materials and workmanship. Steel toe is there but does not bother your toes or comfort as many steel toed boots do. Stand up to lots of punishment and clean off easily. Great for work and home.", "I\u2019ve been purchasing this same model boot for about 12 yrs. though they only last about 2-3 years before either the sole wears out, disintegrates, or separates, for the money they are a good value. I regularly wear them for 12 hrs sometimes more. I find them to be very comfortable. Sometimes I\u2019ll add a gel insert for added confort. The leather is quite durable as well. Because I\u2019ve worn the same model for a while I\u2019ve had about 5-6 pairs. I\u2019ve seen the quality of the sole fall off a cliff. The soles will begin to disintegrate after about 6 months. Poor quality control of the raw materials I guess.", "Do not buy these boots. There is a hard plastic piece sewn into the back of the shoe on the inside that hits your ankle every time you pick your foot up . I'm a landscaper working 7 days a week and could not even where the boots more than an half an hour and my ankle is raw. I wore them around inside the house to break them in and did not have the plastic piece hitting my ankle but once you go outside and start walking on uneven surfaces it hits your ankle every time you pick your foot up.", "Quite disappointed. I normally buy these same pair right off of the Timberland website. My husband is a concrete finisher and he can get 6-8 months out of these boots. I bought these off of amazon because they were a good price and hes only worn them for a month and they are falling apart. I wont be buying these off of amazon anymore. I'd rather pay $20 for quality.", "As I read the reviews on these boots I thought these would be the ones. Well I was wrong. After 2 hours of wearing them at work walking around on a concrete surface, my feet were killing me. I developed huge blisters on my heel from the simple fact that they have almost zero padding on the inside of the boot by the heel area and not sure that there was much more padding anywhere else in the boot. Very disappointed and I am now returning them and going to look for something that at least has padding on the heel and does not feel like i am wearing boots that were made out of concrete.", "Enjoy these boots, first pair I have worn in along time which needed NO breaking period which was awesome. I put them on Saturday morning figuring I would wear them around the house a bit to help break them in, wore them for almost 12 hrs that day and felt great. With the color they naturally scuff a bit easier then other boots depending what you work around but I like them and will certainly be buying another pair when these start to get run down.", "I've owned six pairs of these and they feel good, hold up fairly well and usually last me about one year with almost daily use. As a result, they have been the only boots I've purchased over the last several years.", "Ran very narrow. Had to exchange for a wide. Never worn a wide before so keep that in mind before ordering. Now that I have the wife though. They are very comfortable. Laces pop off sometimes. Just make sure you pull them extra tight. Good boots for the money.", "These boots arrived 4 or 5 days earlier than the original shipping date, which was a surprise. I have only worn them approximately 15-20 hrs working in the woods. The fit is what it should be and they are very comfortable. Other than being a bit heavier than the hiking boots I normally wear, you would never know these were steel toe work boots. They seemed to form to my foot very quickly and, providing they prove to be durable, I would highly recommend them.", "This is a good boot. I always liked timbs and after breaking them in they are comfortable. I had to go with the wider set because i have wider feet but still very comfortable and having the steel toe is just added insurance in my opinion. I will say though that as i was standing in a puddle of water (way below the ankle) water still found its way into the boot.", "This is my husbands 2nd pair. He bought his first pair for over 4 years and the only thing that wore out were the soles. He loved them so much that we bought the the exact same shoe again. He says they are so comfortable he can wear them all day with no discomfort!", "So the boots fit great but theyre not the same color lol", "Good boot so far, but very heavy. Put gel inserts in for better comfort, but my feet are worn out at day's end. I work in a garage and on my feet all day. I'm looking for something lighter next time", "I bought these for my husband and after trying them on, he said they were very uncomfortable. There is something hard on the back of these boots which caused rubbing and hurts. I had to return them.", "I bought these for my work which is a concrete floor machine shop where I walk around and stand for my entire 10 hour shift. I noticed a huge difference from my old work boots. The soles are solid. Great heel, arch, and toe support. Solid steel toe. Great ankle support. I feel cushioned in every step.", "Pretty good after they break in, definitely durable, but while they are doing that your toes might hate you, took mine about 2 weeks of daily wear before they felt more like hiking boots than foot torture devices. I like them the most after I take them off, but you gotta have the PPE to do the job and get the money, and I also like that these don't some stupid ammount. I put superfeet insoles in mine and they feel just as tolerable as more expensive brands I've tried, but maybe my toes have just gotten more numb over the years of abuse?.", "You have to get the next size up and the wide version to get a pair that fits. Took me 3 tries and 3 weeks to get the right size. Once i got them they were still snug for the first few weeks till they broke in. Other than that i love them. Good work boots and very comfy.", "This will be the third pair I've ordered for my husband over the past 9 years for Christmas presents. He LOVES this boot. He will keep the previous pair for a little while longer, as there isn't anything wrong with them structurally, its just that he likes them to look newer. He says they are the most comfortable steel toe boot he's worn, working an average of 50 hours a week on concrete floors. He is constantly standing/ squatting and his boots have never split. It's a plus that they don't look like typical workbooks so he can wear them outside of work. He wears a 10.5 shoe, and I order the same size and he's never complained.", "Personally, I have owned Timbs for about 6 years and it was time to get a new pair. I bought these because it looked like good quality for the price. Well it was one of the worst desisicons I made for footwear. The fact that there is no holes for the laces to go through makes it impossible to tie your shoes without them going out of place. These boots are horrible designed and if you use them for any work place setting you will understand the difficulty.", "Very nice boot. I love the yellow leather look. Sturdy, and well made. Fits very well, I ordered the 11M size. I like that the cleats on the soles are easy to clean, as I am working outdoors in muddy conditions. Highly recommend.", "The fit was good and they're nice looking boots. The swiveling eyelet pulled out of the boot with the first 2 months of having them. I went to the product support page and filled out the information, but haven't heard anything back in about 4 days.", "They are too heavy not what it advertised and my feet were in so much pain when I took them off. It was hard to walk with socks after I removed them. The ball of my feet I could not walk on with out very much pain. I even bought the PRO Inserts to add comfort and that did not work at all. I will be returning the boots back over the weekend. I am not wearing them. Thanks, Dave", "This is my first time ordering boots offline. I usually have to try em on for definite fit before buying. However I've had these in the past from Sears and they've been good boots. I use em for work on a farm and do quite a bit of driving with em as well. Over a course of about 1.5 years, the wrinkles in the shoe behind the toe (from squatting) seem to be the weakest link of this shoe. The wrinkles eventually burst open, still an incredibly comfortable boot as long as u dont use em around water or similar.", "I had an experience with a different brand of shoe and so I was a little worried about doing this again but read the reviews on this boot and decided to try. I\u2019m so thankful I did!! I bought for work and wear them 12 hours a day, 6 days a week for the last few months and they are still as comfortable as the first day I put them on! There was no \u201cbreak-in\u201d period needed for these boots!! When/if they wear out, I will definitely buy again!!", "Fulfilled expectations. Used clearing fallen timber on uneven ground. Good quality. If Wolverine boots were available I would have bought them even at a higher price as they are made in USA.", "This is the second pair I buy but not for a good reason. First one I bought was small. Was expecting it to be the same size as my Timberland shoes, but it\u2019s 1 full US size smaller. Quality and finish was not the best. And on the second pair, the alignment of the steel toe cap on the left boot is wrong ! It is clearly not straight, and of course I can\u2019t use it. Now I\u2019m back to my old CAT steel toes, while I wait for an answer from Timberland.", "I gave these boots a few weeks to see if they would break in properly. For the most part they are great and are very durable, but there is a seam in the heel of these boots that protrudes into your foot. It\u2019s been bruising the back of my heel and I\u2019ve been hoping that I would wear it down, but it still feels as stiff as the first day I bought them. Time to look for new boots again.", "I have owned timberland boots for more than 29 years. I recently bought the soft toe variety of this boot and Love it. But this is the second time I have bought steel toes from Timberland and they are both too narrow in the front of the boot. This boot in particular is very narrow and I will be returning them and looking for other boots.", "They seem to work , going to give it a few weeks then update this", "I can\u2019t believe what a great pair of work boots these are. They\u2019re not only stylish, but very supportive with built-in arch support for your feet. At first it was a little weird to me as my left arch of my foot didn\u2019t quite match up with the shoe. I was worried I would have to return it. But after about 15 to 30 minutes of use my foot and shoe began to contour together and these have been the most comfortable work boots I\u2019ve ever worn since. I would highly recommend them to anyone .", "Very nice boots . A little smaller that sizing I'm used to but ok. I had to send the first pair back because of width. Order a half size bigger than usual Quality is great. Juat a little heavy I noticed", "Very strong material. My husband loves it! He wears when he works back yard cut the wood. His shoes size is 7 usually but For this one, 7.5 boots fit perfectly well. Good purchase! So far so good. Satisfied.", "I Use to wear Red Wings but I can actually buy 2 pairs of these for what Red Wings now cost, even tho they too are mostly made in China now. The fit is just about right for you're regular shoe size, But if you are in a cold area and wear thick socks in the winter you might want to go a half size up, They fit nice and snug with a regular sock tho", "These things lasted me alot longer than more expensive over rated boots. I work on cars and boots on concrete and metal bays. These held up. Been wearing timberland since I was young. Always quality", "As far as steel cap boots go, these are comfortable. I did cheat on the sizing and go to my local Timberland store and determine my sizing. I did go with the intention to buy on the spot but they unfortunately didn't stock safety boots. Customer service in store was great so I wished I could have bought from them. These boots did require some time to break-in to my feet, so the first two or so times I wore them all day walking I did blister up, but they are great to wear now.", "I bough these about a year ago and...Toes are too sore after wearing these for two weeks. Had to retire them early. Still sitting in my box. Maybe I needed a size larger. But all other boots and shoes fit me in this size. They are not comfortable. Maybe they are for someone else but not me. Two stars for at least they fit right!!", "The eyelets on the left boot did not align. I'm not super picky, but this was very noticeable. It was so bad, I was concerned about the performance of the boot. So I'm sending them back and hopefully the replacement boots will not have the same issue. Other than that, boots are awesome. I was replacing a pair that I had for 12 years.", "Very comfortable. I work driving a truck and making deliveries and they are very comfortable while driving and making deliveries. Offer great protection and keep my feet dry during wet conditions. The truck I drive is a refrigerated truck so the floor can get very slippery and the boots offer excellent traction.", "I've worn these boots for a few years now and they have held up well. They are a little hard on the feet but work boots are not known for comfort. I'd recommend some inserts to help. Overall, they are very protective and endured well.", "These shoes are quality made an take a few months to break in cause they were super stiff. Yet once they broke in.. They became super flexible. Overall a great work boot. Way better build quality then Walmart work boots thats for sure.", "My last pair lasted me 6yrs and I work in a distribution center. I put these boots thru hell and they lasted. That is the reason I only buy Timberland boots. I have dropped pallets on them, worked on cars, climbed through junkyards, worked in freezers, walked on ice - Always a great grip, protection and warmth. Best boots you can buy", "I've been a chef for 7 years, and rarely do my work shoes last for over half a year. These boots are already well past a year, and are bar-none the best work shoes I've ever worn. The ankle support is great; the cushion and padding is wonderful for staying on your feet for 9+ hours a day; the actual boots are tough as hell, too. I recommend these boots to everyone I meet, and should the day come that mine bite the dust, I will happily replace them with the exact same model.", "The Timberland PRO 9.5 W size pitboss Steel-Toe. The 9.5 medium is too constrictive, and I don't have a wide foot. Be forewarned. This is a comfortable shoe. I switched over from one of the Wolverine Durashock boots when my retailer ran out of stock in my size. I have never looked back. These are great boots. They always last me a good year and a half with everyday wear. Could have stretched it out to two years but I like the feel, look, and smell (or lack of smell) of new boots.", "I had really high expectations for these boots. All the boot review websites and Amazon reviews are anazing. As a commercial electrician I have been digging ditches for underground power and these boots are not holding up. I've been wearing them for 3 weeks and they are starting to break down already. The leather is not tough and has deep cuts and gashes in them. I would not buy again. I wish I could return them.", "Bought these for son who is completing an apprenticeship. They replaced a much more expensive Red Wing boot that was falling apart, literally, after 14 months. He said the Timberlands are much more comfortable. They are oil resistant and are looking nice for a longer period. Great boot at an excellent price!", "I love these boots. I love how I can wear them anywhere and not have to concern myself with getting them dirty or damaged. They survived a motorcycle crash and skid on asphalt for about 50 yards, so that was impressive. And most importantly, they are just the most comfortable boots I've worn from Timberland. I love them and they can withstand anything I throw at them, or drop on them, ha (steel-toed joke). Just remember that if the metal-detector goes off after you've taken all your metal objects out of your pockets, it's the boots.", "I had the same boots for two years. Quality is definitely not in question. I put them through the wringer daily. Until I got the wide boot they were wearing at my feet pretty bad. But now they are really comfortable. For the quality, price and good looks, this is probably the best boot you can buy.", "Im still in the break in period so i cant say too much as of right now. I only gave 4 stars since a tiny piece of the leather on the steel toe chiped off. These are replaying my old work boots that lasted 3 years, and i noticed these boots are way more tighter around the ankles so be ready to limb a while for the first few days.", "Signs Now I got a new one so they are about product quality because now before my shoes that I have my foot it doesn't stink now that I have the new shoes are using it my foot is think so that is that about material that is me I don't think so because I have the old shoes today I don't have that problem.", "I wear these boots 12 hours a day, most of that time I am on my feet. These particular Timberlands had a break in period, during that time I wasn't too sure if I would like them compared to the Timberlands i normally buy. However after a week or so they fit great and were really comfortable. **Disclaimer** I always take out the insoles and switch them out for dr scholls because i have high arches. I have been told the normal insoles are just fine for people with normal arches. These boots are great, they look good out of the box and look even better after you spill some oil and dirt on them!", "I'm a year and a few months in so far and everything is still great. The leather, sole, heel, and toe are all holding up nicely. These boots are exposed to dirt and cutting oil frequently, and I mostly walk around in them but on occasion I do some heavy work. I can't attest to the comfort of these by themselves as I immediately put in Dr. Scholls running insoles, but they broke-in in less than a week.", "I think it\u2019s best to say: these aren\u2019t just cool kids boots. These are working persons boots! Rugged, well sewn, long lasting andgreat slip resistant sole. Been wearing them a while and still feel nice. Will buy again.", "I wear a size 10 1/2 in shoes, boots and sneakers. So I ordered theses in 10 1/2 wide. I figured the \u201cwide\u201d size would give more space for the steel toe. I was very wrong... 10 1/2 wide was horribly small. So I exchanged them for a 11 1/2 wide and they fit kinda snug so I decided to keep them, I figured they just need to \u201cbreak in\u201d. After one 12 hour day my feet were swollen because of how uncomfortable these boots are. And on the second day, putting them on the strap (you can see in the picture) broke with the slightly tug on it. I wouldn\u2019t recommend these boots to anyone", "This is my first pair of Timberlands and probably not my last. I'm standing on concrete 8 hours a day, so after wearing out and breaking down another pair of cheap (inexpensive) boots I decided to give these a try. It took about half a day to break them in- no pain, no blisters. My dogs aren't barking at the end of the day now like they were, and no more \"man, my feet are killing me.\" They fit fine as expected 9 and a half normal width.", "My hubby said it felt like it didnt have any arch support. He does like then but he has problems with his back and now the arch of his foot. I bought inserts for the boots too.", "Great boots. I'll never buy other boots. I drive a bus & these boots work great. I have trouble finding shoes that works well for me. I think one foot is wider than the other. These boots are great. Ty Timberland", "This was a great buy, had Timberland before and loved them. This purchase was no different and extremely satisfied.", "Such a comfortable boot!! I work in hvac and needed a boot that could handle what I do. Couldn't ask for a better product Update: I've had these boots for almost two years and they are just now starting to need replaced. I wear these boots HARD 5 days a week and I can't say enough about how much I like them. I will keep ordering these as long as they keep making them", "Good boot, a little heavy but good protection. I stand on a concrete floor (automotive shop) for my entire 9-hr shift, and these get the job done. I do have an extra cushion on the sole. I've now bought 3 pairs of these, they take me about a year to wear through the toe (although I don't kneel much)", "I bought these for my husband to wear through the winter for warmth, snow and ice. I ordered a size bigger for heavy socks. My husband wished they were a little higher to keep the snow out. During snowstorms he would wear his old boots. So his next pair Ineed to measure the height.", "I bought these boots on March 24th. Due to the coronavirus they havent got much wear. I bought them because Timberland says they make work boots for hard working people. This is not true. I work too hard to spend my money on something that wont last.", "You can't go wrong for the price and quality here. This is my second pair, I bought the exact same boot again because I liked it and it got the job done. Met all specs required for my work area, comfortable, and good overall value. My last pair lasted about 2.5 years. I am sure I will get similar out of this pair too.", "We bought these boots for my husband because my brother had them and said they were awesome. My husband agrees that they are awesome. He used to take off his work boots the second he walked in the door, but with these- he wears them until he goes to bed and even wears them on weekends sometimes. My brother wears his to do everything also. He wears them for hiking and even wears them to play softball because he says they are super comfortable and his foot feels more secure in them than any other shoes he has ever owned. The price was great too, but we would pay twice what we paid because they really are the best boots!", "After wearing Caterpillar boots for years I decided to try Timberland. One of the tabs one one boot came out when I went to tighten the lace. Poor workmanship. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t attempt to put them on for 2-1/2 months after I received them so I couldn\u2019t return them. I am too used to Amazon and reliability of what I buy and I became a lazy consumer. The other boot looks like a great product though. I have since ordered two pair of Caterpillar boots, looked at and tried on both pair day I received them. I gave two stars because one boot was fine.", "I've always used timberland pro boots at work. I just got these rather than the Ripsaw style I usually get. I picked the same size and wore them for a few days since. They feel like they're half a size too big. The heel is loose and has made me purchase thick socks to keep my foot secured. The Ripsaw felt secure all around so I expected the same from the Pit Boss. Clearly not. The company has never steered me wrong and I've always been happy with their products. I'll just know to try them on locally before i purchase them online cheaper.", "Most uncomfortable Steel Toe shoes I ever had. I had to returned them with a week, because it was tight on the ankles and unconfortable as hell. I love timberlands but not these.", "Most comfortable boots - and arguably shoes (other than my sneakers of course) that I have ever owned. Excellent ankle and arch support, as well as a cushy feel while walking. The steel toes are surprisingly light. The soles feel nice, have good grip on every surface I've tried, and the overall design looks really nice. They don't wear too fast, and even when they do they stay in great shape. Break in period was only about an hour, a bit more on the heel. Excellent boots, these will be the only brand and style I will ever buy. Timberland gained a lifelong customer with these fantastic boots.", "I am in the Construction industry and have bought many different kind of boots - I bought these less then a year ago and they are already ripping. I plan on reaching out to the seller in hopes to get a new pair. Very disappointed in the quality.", "Wow, I'm generally a size 9 and am used to very tight shoes, (climbing for 25+ years). I got a second pair of these in 9.5 Wide and the toe box feels like a pair of climbing boots. Super narrow. Not sure why so many shoes curve and cut off the outside sides of the toes. Otherwise seemed well made.", "For a 80.00 pair of boots they sure didn't live up to expectations. The second day I wore them the boot lace loop pulled off. I e mailed Timberland and months later still no reply. I can mail them back to Amazon but then I would not have boots for work. I can tell you this, I will never buy Timberland boots again.", "After the second time wearing the product the clasp on the right shoe ripped out. While the shoe is still usable, it makes it awkward to walk in due to the laces being tight but not in the right place. The coating on the front of the shoe is easily torn, gouged and fragile. I would not recommend this product.", "I've been buying these boots for years but this was my first purchase through Amazon. They are exactly the same as the one's I've been buying locally. I really like that they are brand new, never been worn. When you buy a pair from the store there's no telling how many people have tried them on before you. I work in construction and, in my opinion, these are the best work boots out there. They include every feature I need including electrical shock protection. They are pretty stiff at first but after a couple weeks they break-in real well and fit more comfortably than other boots which are softer out-of-the-box.", "I've only worn them a few days, but they're good so far. The fit was a little large, but I wear a gel insole with them and that took up the extra space. The leather needs a good couple coats of leather protectant like Obenauf's, and it seems to be strong yet pliable. I have put a scrape in them, but it was from a fairly shop object in the shop, so I'm not surprised. Other than that, the soles are fairly hard and the stock insole isn't very cushioning, so an aftermarket insole is a help if you're on your feet for 8 hours a day or more. Overall, I'm happy with them, though.", "The most comfortable work boot I've ever owned! No need to break them in. My only complaint is there are 2 exposed rivets on the inside that irritated my ankles. I added small padded patches and fixed! Ultra comfortable.", "I use this for work and I tend to stand for hours with these on, they don't hurt your feet. I would recommend wearing thicker socks because the sides can rub against your ankles! Overall, they meet the standards of most work places and it is affordable.", "Product runs about half size small and narrower than most. I wear a size 11 in sketchers and ASICS. I read the reviews saying these run narrow so I ordered 11w. They were way too small so I exchanged them for 11.5w and they fit great. I've been wearing them for about 2 weeks and they have been great work boots so far.", "Before I purchased these for my husband, I read the reviews that said they needed a day to break in, then they were really comfortable. Two weeks have passed, and my husband is still waiting for just \"comfortable\". He even wears his previously never worn tennis shoes on days off to recover until he has to put these on again. He is a bigger guy, so, maybe they are best for someone who doesn't need much foot support? I'm still looking for that ultra comfortable (or even reasonably comfortable) work boot for my hard working husband-with no additional special shoe insert required. He did say that his last pair of Caterpillar boots were more comfortable than this pair.", "These seem to be good quality rugged boots from the few days I have spent in them. The boot fits fine and sized as I expected. I was hoping for a more comfortable boot that I wasn't excited about taking off, but my feet are much happier out of the boots than in them. Maybe they just need an insole.", "This is the second pair of these boots that i have had fail This pair barely lasted a month. The eyes are not attached to the shoes very well . The first pair i had the eye pulled off when tying the shoe after about 6 months. This pair did not make it one month! They are comfortable but just poorly made. Very unhappy that i spent $100 to wear a pair of boots for one month. They are NOT that comfortable.", "I purchased these for my son who is on his feet a great deal in a parts yard. He says these boots are very comfortable and his feet do not get crazy hot. They seem to be durable; however, he has not had them long enough to comment on that yet.", "These were pretty roomy when i got them. Didn't have to break in and they're definitely comfortable. I work in a machine shop and my doc martens slip alot less. Still worth what i paid for them though. Probably would do really well in a warehouse or construction setting. Anywhere you're not gonna be slipping over oil all the time.", "Great for hard workers and those who are rough on their shoes. Very durable and also heavy. They really have worked well for my husband (a mechanic). He's on his feet all day and deals with alot of chemicals but these have held up nicely. I don't think we'll go back to any other brand after this.", "Pull tab ripped after a week. They're great boots, so I'm going to just live with that. Other than that, they're great \u2014 waterproof (for now), leather is breaking in nicely, seems like good construction.", "They are Timberland's and they run big.. Just hope you know that before purchasing... I also bought Dr Sholls with these so I can't say how comfortable they are without em. They've done me good for about 6 months but I am always on my feet so I'm ordering a new pair of the Dr sholls today.. The outer shell is holding up well through the tough conditions I've put em in. Edit: Just bought another pair a half of a size smaller... They ended up being waaay too tight. Not sure if they changed but since this review, I've bought 2 timberland's and they've both actually were made to size.", "Boots are very comfortable but after wearing it for a little over 4 months the sole on the left boot started to peel off. Not acceptable. Also, I dont see a way of contacting the seller. I will have to stay away from this brand from now on. This is my 4th pair of Timberlands over the years and these ones are a disapointment. .", "I hate to give timberland\u2019s a bad review but these boots are just awful. There\u2019s a part at the top of the boot that digs into your ankle bone not sure why there is a hard piece of plastic or whatever\u2019s in there. It\u2019s there and it makes the boot unbearable to wear unfortunately not sure I can return bring a UPS driver one wear and they\u2019re pretty beat up. This is the first bad boot I got from timberland\u2019s in the 15 plus years I\u2019ve been ordering them but still being that they cost way not than an average boot not sure I can buy another pair.", "It takes a few months of wearing in different conditions to really test boots. They fit nicely, arrived when expected and the Amazon price was good. If I have any problems with these later I can update this post, but good vendors to buy from and the product seems very good so far.", "I've tried other work boots over the years, always go back to Timberland, they need minimal breaking in and they usually last longer than most other brands. I put a pr of foam cushion inserts in and they are pretty comfortable for a steel toe boots.", "Im so disappointed of this shoes and im just using it fir my work in the baggage counter and it pops out the button who holds the lace :( anyone help me to get my warranty this shoe is almost 4 to 5 months when i bought this to amazon \ud83d\ude1e im so disappointed with this timbs...", "This is a great boot, esp for the money. I am a construction/warehouse worker. I work 12 hour days and rarely am off my feet so boots are very important, and these didnt disappoint. They fit well, are comfortable, and arent too heavy. there is little wear after two months and other boots I have had didnt last even that long and I had paid more for them. Try these boots, I'll be buying another pair. Edit: haven't had to buy a new pair yet after a year. these are hands down the best boots I have ever owned, and I have tried many. Update: Boots lasted 35 months, got a new pair this week.", "A little uncomfortable when standing for long periods of time, but isn't that basically any work boot? I make trips to shipyards, and these are great for walking around on ships under construction or upgrades.", "These came as expected. Really nice looking. Returned them only because my son wanted a better, tougher boot for his type of work. These are great for the price and light outside work.", "Old pair lasted 3 years of 50 hour weeks in an auto repair shop so of course I'm buying the the same pair again. The picture shows the old pair next to the new pair after just one day of use and yes they are the same color. Only replacing them because I could only replace the insoles so many times. Worth every penny.", "Digs into the back of my heel. After one day of wearing I have a mild blister. Slightly looser than expected, soles dont quite match up , arent symmetrical or identical. Inserts feel like they arent in because they are so thin and uncomfortable . Overall these boots remind me of a pair of $40 walmart brahma boots", "I had a previous pair for 17 years using them for fishing, snow shoveling, rainy weather and upper leather still looked great. Would have kept them even longer if soles didn't perish. Bought another pair without a second of hesitation", "This boot has a place on the inside that rubs on my ankle and is uncomfortable. More padding in this area might help with this. Other than this, the boots are made well and are comfortable.", "Comfortable. A little heavy. Wear them everyday and I am over a year of 50 hour weeks and they are due to be retired. Leather held up well and the sole is just starting to fall apart. Still attached though. The lace rivers broke off which my only complaint. A couple broke off about 6 months in.", "I purchased these work boots as a gift for my son who has large feet (15 W) and who is \"hard on shoes.\" He says they are \"very comfortable.\" They are also durable and reasonably priced. He has gotten them before (different color) and says he would buy them again.", "Very uncomfortable at first, took way longer than they should have to break in. By that I mean about 4 months of wearing them all weekend for automotive repair... maybe I'm just a pansy but they chafed the hell out of my ankles and bothered my heal for a while. They're fairly comfortable now, and the good part is they are extremely tough and I don't foresee them wearing out for years to come.", "These were perfect boots for my son to start a summer job in construction. They gave him blisters the first week, but after that were very comfortable. Blisters are to be expected when wearing a construction boots and climbing several flights of stairs every day.", "Purchased these for my husband who is required to wear steel toe work boots. They were scuffed all around the front of the boot as if they\u2019d been worn before.", "Good boot it's fair but the hoops break too easy I bought two pair at two different times and the loops broke on both pair", "These are the best work boots I've ever owned. I'm a 51 year old truck driver so I don't put the wear and tear on them construction worker in his 20's would but these are replacing a 9year old pair of the same model. The treads worn down some and winter in Ohio is coming so it was time to replace them. I got my moneys worth", "Fantastic looking boot. They do take a little bit to break in, but once you do, they are very comfortable. I find If I don't lace up the top two clips, they are easy to slip on and off, but then when I go to the job site and lace using those clips, they are very solid and secure, and offer excellent ankle support. I also treated them with some leather waterproofing (bee's wax based stuff) and they did great keeping my feet dry in the rain. Also wore on a very hot summer day, I was sweating like crazy, but my feet didn't overheat.", "I have used the Pitboss 6\" boots for several weeks on 100% concrete floors. They are really strong boots. However, the steel toe makes them heavy and there isn't much in the boot for cushioning against the concrete. The boot is pretty stiff due to the leather but I'm hoping it will loosen up over time. For now, I have switched to a much more comfortable pair of composite toe combat boots from another shoe maker that are great on concrete. I do plan to use these boots around the house and garage.", "Good boot I enjoy it, the heel sometimes does chafe as people describe. No matter how tight I tie them on the right heel I still feel something going up and down next to my heel. Ive gotten used to it so it no longer bothers me, good boot though.", "My husband, the smarta$$, said they were really comfortable, easy to tie, fit perfectly (we used the sizing chart as a guide to make sure) They offer good support for his feet and his knees don't hurt as much in them. I dunno... it's what he said. >.< In his own words, he adds: \"not too big, not too small, not too hard, not too soft, not too hot, not too cold...they're Juuuuuuust right\" >.< So, anyway, I bought them because Timberland has a REALLY good reputation. They're durable and comfortable! These are living upto Timberland's reputation :)", "My husband's go to work boot! As a tile/hard surface installer, good quality, comfortable, durable work boots are a must! These last him around 6 months which is a lot longer than other brands he has tried. It's like Christmas morning for him every time he puts on a new pair. Steel toe protection is important on the job site! He even travels in these because he's so comfortable in them. He used to buy the taller pair when we worked in colder weather, but these are perfect for him in the sunny state of Hawaii!", "good boots, this is my second pair. I have WIDE or should I say W I D E feet. I also have very, very flat feet. Most arch support built in rub painfully. It is difficult to find a boot or shoe to fit comfortably. This one does. NOTE: My first pair was purchased through a salesmen who visited the work site - he recommended skipping every other hole when lacing the boot on the lower part - works like a charm for me, but I work inside. (Required to wear steel-toes when I'm out on the factory floor, but I can wear these all day long (and do)).", "Very nice boots but they hurt my one foot. Not tall enough inside for my thick fungus toenails on that foot. Other foot doesn\u2019t have any.", "Once putting these on I felt that It was the most secure my feet been, experiencing later what it is without them on. The one thing is you'll have to get SteelToe socks or your going to be in measure in pain.", "At first they were unwearable due to the stiffness of the ankle leather. Heavy duty, good fabric and craftsmanship. Good support. Wide feet but the Width was good. Fixed the leather issue.", "I'm not a huge boot guy but I needed some work boots and these were priced very reasonably and always liked my old Timberlands. I was not disappointed. For a full size steel-toe boot they are very comfortable and you are NOT slipping in these. My wife loves them on me too. I've had them for a couple years now and they still clean up like new. If you want a work boot that is comfortable, durable, and as stylish as work boots go, this belongs among the top of the list.", "Been wearing them in the construction/industrial setting for four days- 12 hour days. The material used for the insides of the boot rubs the side of my ankles and my heels raw. I have to use gauze along with long soccer socks to avoid irritation to the point of bleeding. Good work boots but could use some improvements on the comfort side.", "I love these boots!!! They are so comfortable, I don\u2019t even notice wearing them the whole day, every day for 3 weeks now.\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I wore them from day one and they didn\u2019t seem to need to be broken in!)", "For the money this is my go to boot. We get a $90 per year boot allowance at work and for me these hold up for exactly 1 and a half years. The way it works out, at the end of 3 years I get bank a pair of boots. Those are my going out boots.", "The most uncomfortable boots I\u2019ve ever worn. Even driving to work these things hurt. Super tight around the toes and very hard and uncomfortable against the back of heel. Tried to break them in anyway, after wearing two weeks they\u2019re no better and already beginning to fall apart.", "The most comfortable and durable boots I have ever worn. They hold up great with the daily ground and pound. I\u2019m not in construction or anything similar, but running 2 businesses back and forth and in the shop, I wear these about 18 hours a day. Completely happy with this purchase!", "3 months so far, boot is good, slip proof, comfortable and durable. A little on the tight side in the toe box region. Definitely will buy again but wider to accommodate for thicker socks", "Didn't feel very comfy on my ankles. Been using Timberlands for years and never had a problem. I can see it becoming an issue with extensive use. Might be a design flaw but its definitely super tight around the ankles.", "So.. I have many boots, some I keep for water proof ability, some I keep for comfort but I've never been able to wear a steel toed boot as they never fit without rubbing. These boots are an excellent value, very well made and good looking. I have always been a Redwing Boot man but when my coworkers came back with their Redwings now made in China that deal is broken. Frankly, I'm willing to pay double this price if they are made in the USA but since most everyone has sold out... I'll recommend these boots with top ratings. I highly recommend these boots and will likely be ordering another pair for my home.", "Horrible quality!! Hardware started to pop off the boot within the first week! Completely surprised with the lack of quality of this product. I've always trusted this brand and never would have thought I'd have an experience like this. Definitely not worth the money! Deeply dissatisfaction with this one", "This are nice and confortable, i like the idea of having the steel toe protection. Fit as expected. I think im gonna wear mine for fun first, then in a few months, bring them to work.", "I bought these for my boyfriend, and he loves them. He typically wears a size 9 boot but after reading the comments I saw a lot of people saying they were a bit tight/narrow so I went with a size 9wide and he said they are the most comfortable work boots he\u2019s had.", "There is a place in the back of the heel that\u2019s sewn wrong. Your going to regret this purchase. My first two reviews have been blocked.", "My husband loves his steel toed boots- a preference rather than a \u201cneed\u201d for work. We\u2019ve gone through most popular brands in the last 15 years- caterpillar and even Harley. He says these are by far his favorite. Very sturdy, very comfortable. Fit was true to size.", "I have been buying a new pair of Timberland Pro Pit Boss every year for many years. This year after wearing the boots for 5 months the sole of both boots are separating. It appears as if the soles were snapped on and not glued on. I am a lawn contractor and the boots were never exposed to chemicals of any kind. Just water. Very disappointed with this product and will probably be changing brands. I would think twice about buying this product.", "For the price these boots get the job done. Although they're heavier than other pairs I have had, they are comfortable enough and I wear them for 12+ hours every day without an issue. They fit true to size and have a roomy toe-box. I work inside of a factory so I can not contest their longevity, but with time I may add an update as time goes on to report on how long they last. As of now they still get my nod of approval and I would likely buy another pair once these wear out.", "Good quality. Very comfortable. True to size. Highly recommended. For a pair of work shoes with steel toes protection, you won't go wrong with this one.", "Simply the best work boot brand out there. I work in stocking/warehouse work and am on my feet 99% of the day. While boots may work well for awhile they wear out quickly. No other boot lasts as long, or stays comfortable as long. Worth every dollar!", "You can feel the steel toe dig into your foot. Maybe it's just me but, these seem super narrow what a joke. I have heard this from other coworkers that try them as well. You would think timber would've figured this out but I guess not. Go with timberland boondocks if you need a good workboot.", "Comfortable hard working boot. I have wearing them to do landscaping, excavation and paving for the past two weeks and I am very happy with my purchase. They are much more comfortable than I thought they would and the look really good. I strongly recommend these boots.", "I bought a wide size and didn\u2019t find them to be very wide whatsoever. They aren\u2019t comfortable and since wearing them I have been experiencing foot pain in multiple locations on each foot.", "After a few weeks the back of the boots rub your heel to the point that they are unusable . Toe cap seem a bit small. These will no longer be used for work.", "I tried wearing them at work for three months. Most uncomfortable boots I have ever worn. They rubbed against the left side of my ankle every step that i took. Finally gave up on wearing them. Worst $150 i ever spent. I bought them, because ,i have had 2 pairs in the past. The first pair lasted 4 years.The second pair about 10 months before they started leaking water and getting my feet wet. Quality of the boot has really went downhill. Will not buy again. Would rate a zero, but it won't let me.", "Purchased these boots online and arrived within two days. I had picked up another pair of boots from a work boot store and they did not fit nearly as well as these ones which I purchased through Amazon. These boots are very roomy, durable and comfortable. I have worn these boots on a daily basis over my boots form the other source. The foot sensor and measuring machine placed me in a pair of boots that are too tight, uncomfortable and very high priced. I have worn them once in six months. I would definitely purchase a second pair from this source of these same boots.", "I have worn these boots before. I actually loved them. I purchased this pair, same as the others. The left boot is digging into my inner ankle on the left boot. I seriously shove an old rag in there to keep it from killing me. Very painful. I would have returned them. In my job I am an auto painter they were totally messed up my first day wearing them. I also thought they needed a break in. Well a couple weeks later. Still have the rag shoved in the shoe to keep it from killing my ankle. Right boot no problems. Oh well its a lemon", "I definitely got my moneys worth with these boots. I have always bought Redwings because they last, or used to. The last two pairs I purchased were the glued on composite sole, and they come apart after a year. The ones with sewn on soles are now $300. So, I found these for 1/3 the price and I love them. I've had them for a month and now prefer them to Redwings. The quality of construction shows. Try a pair, you won't be disappointed.", "My husband said the steel toe part was not as rounded as his Skechers steel toed shoes. It was pushing down on his toes. Also the boot was tighter than normal. He wears a 81/2 and I ordered a 9. Just returned the boots.", "This is my second pair of these boots. Great to work in. I'm on concrete for 12+ hours a day an these are the best. Except the boots I just got today looks like some has worked in them already. I know there just work boots but I dont want to send 100 dollars on used boots.", "This was the most uncomfortable pair of work boots I even own. I had blisters from hell on my heels from wearing this for just an hour. Don\u2019t waste your money", "Returning. I wear work boots 5 days a week. One day in timberline and I've got a sore spot/wound on the back of both my feet. Almost took a picture of it but it looks gross.", "I will give these boots 5 stars if they hold up for more than a year because I love that they are very comfortable especially working on concrete and crawlspaces all day, Nice. Its hard to find a boot that holds up and is affordable. I owned a pair of Herman survivor steel toes from wal-mart and are still in good working order after 2 years but they just stink really bad. Haha. the timberlands will be a great improvement if they last longer than those $40 pair.", "These fit really well and take quite some time to break in, but endure through, they get better. The outside middle of my feet hurt where the seam is, especially the right foot. I don't know if it is a defect or just the way the boot is made - I honestly could have used a wider size if it were available. I am using these as a replacement of my Danner US made re-craftable boots that were destroyed beyond repair in under two years of summer recreational use. Never again - I've got high hopes for these boots.", "I\u2019ve worn boots for years, and well prefer timberlands to any other brand including justin, bates, and of course red wings. However, as timberlands go, I\u2019ve never worn a pair as cheap price wise as these... they certainly have impressed me though. They feel just like powerselts, and way better then any red wings. I highly recommend.", "I dont wear any other boot for work. I wear them to bed sometimes. Wife tried to complain once. I explained how hard these boots work and they deserve a night in bed.", "Timberland PRO's have been the best boot for my husband's work as a maintenance mechanic that I have purchased for him in the past ten years! This is his fourth pair and they wear well, are comfortable and have never come apart at the seams or sole. However because he is on his knees frequently crawling around and fixing machinery I also purchase and apply Boot Saver rubber guards on the toes because that is where holes to the steel toe did develop. I also purchased one size larger to accommodate his Good Feet insoles. Love the boots, but took away one star as I ordered them on the 21st from Amazon and did not receive them until Dec 1st.", "I love how well the steel-toe boot feels, it does not feel as though it is a boot at all but your actual foot. It encapsulates your feet and makes you feel less worried about your surroundings. I am in the aerospace industry and will gladly say that each day I go to work I have no fear of my feet getting harmed. These boots hold up well against just about anything. I highly recommend them to individuals who work in any and all different fields.", "They are way too wide for being EE. I love the boots but every time I wear them they are throwing my hip out of balance even with inserts. The quality is great the seal is great it's just every time I wear them they make my body feel terrible unlike any other boots or shoes. Wearing them once makes me feel like my hip is bruised for a week.", "Boots are OK. They keep away water for now. But I work in concrete so I\u2019m on my feet all day, boots were very hard to break in with excessive wear it took about 4 months...not kidding, feet were in pain the whole time, the size was right they were just VERY stiff. A year later they\u2019re still OK.", "I bought these shoes as a fathers day gift for my dad he has only had them for a month and they give him alot of pain. They are really heavy. He has arthritis and these shoes are definitely not recommended if you do aswell.", "Definitely would recommend getting a half size up, especially if you wear thick socks. Also, i had the same problem as others with it being extremely uncomfortable around the ankle as there is part of a plastic molding under the inside lining that sits right under my ankle. Couldn't wear for more than 15 minutes without pretty bad pain at my ankles. Will be returning these boots unfortunately. Otherwise, the boots look great and seem to be made from good quality materials.", "3 months and they look like this. My husband does wear them everyday but he\u2019s a truck driver. Ordered April 11th and today this is what they look like. Won\u2019t order again", "Biggest reason I got these is because they claimed to be water proof and I Use these shoes daily not even half a year in and first time ever stepping into any puddle my feet get absolutely soaked entering from the bottom I hardly write reviews but this frustrated me heavily highly do not recommend getting these if you\u2019re in construction", "This shoes fit good. But this shoes are trash when support quality. I use for 3 days and didnt help me reduce the fatigue. Shoes are heavy. Its like other normal shoes just with brand name added in to the shoes. I don't recommend this shoes. I have to drop this shoes and purchase anothe pair from other brand that help me more reducing the fatigue to be stand, walk, stand in a machine.", "Well made but a very narrow toe box. I am a female and order men\u2019s shoes to have a wider fit. But these are narrow like females foot wear. Had to return", "Boots showed up looking like 2 other people had worn em, laced up and dirty. But i threw my old boots out and needed the Timberlands for work the next day. I just let it slide, but i did pay over 100 bucks for used boots, and you asked for a review", "I work in an environment where I deal with hazardous material, I wear those boots every day for 8 ours a day in FL, feet are comfortable, boots are well made and are the one who have the highest duration from several brands I bought in the past.", "I have always worn timberland pro boots as long as i can remember. I work in a tire shop and they have outperformed any other boots ive tried. Great product, great price.", "Nice looking boot that took awhile to break in. I ordered the Timberland PRO Anti-Fatigue insoles as well and they still blistered the sides of my toes and back of my heels for the first 2-3 weeks. I work 12 hour shifts walking 8-11 miles a day as a tech in an automotive factory (concrete, steel, stairs, etc) so my feet really take a beating. Unfortunately the top eyelet for the laces just snapped off the last time I tied them after only about 6-7 weeks of wear. Timberland appears to have a year warranty so hopefully this issue can be addressed. I can't rate any higher due to that and the torturous break in period.", "I have tried several different brands of work boots and so far nothing lasts near as long as these boots. Great quality and comfort for a work boot. Very rugged.", "These boots are my husbands fave. He has to replace them once a year though for as rough as he is on them. This is his 3rd pair and no complaints.", "I didn't even try these on. These were advertised as new but they clearly had been used. The outside leather was noticeably scuffed up and the inside of the shoes were full of animal hair.", "There was a problem with the right heel and I had to grind it down with a drummel to be able to wear it", "These fit great and feel great. Great quality. Decided to get the non-waterproof ones and then buy a spray to do it myself. The padded back ankle is absolutely necessary for a work boot.", "I\u2019ve owned other Timberland shoes for work and they\u2019ve always been good. The soles on some in the past have had some issues with wearing quickly. Been wearing for about two months now and the sole seems to be holding up well.", "These were a perfect fit for my son and he says extremely comfortable! He needed them for his construction classes and they're working out quite well so far - ery happy with our purchase!", "These are great boots. I will buy these again when they wear out for as long as they are made. They had a broken in feeling on the first day.", "Poor craftsmanship, steel toe was placed haphazardly on my boot, looks terrible. Didn't open box in time to return. 110.00 for ugly boots. I will not buy Timberland again.", "I have bought those boots for years and always replaced with the same... I love them. This time was a bit aof a problem as I purchased wide 9.5 but the actual boot was regular instead even though the box did say wide. Never had that issue before but no matter what I will still keep on buying the same boots for as long as they make them. I work in the trade and look for comfort, safety and a product that lasts.... This is the one for me", "I have feet issues because of years of standing on concrete and steel and these are the only ones I have found that doesn\u2019t cause me foot pain while working long hours. Very comfortable and after 6 months still holding up really well in wet and dry. Quality like you expect from Timberlands. Will definitely buy another pair once these are done.", "Great boot, very durable, pretty comfortable, looks tough, kinda heavy but tolerable. I work with asphalt and i beat the crap out of these things, they hold like a tank. I went to a local work boot store to try them on and do some pricing. I'm glad I did. I normally wear a 9.5w and had to order 10.5w to fit properly and also saved around 30 bucks going with Amazon. Be sure to hit Timberland's home page too, there was an Amazon coupon that knocked another 10% off the top. Delivery only took a few days #thumbsup", "Boots fit well, but after 2 weeks of use both boots have caused my feet to hurt on the edge back by my heel. It\u2019s as if the soul has an arch on the outside edge. Will not buy again.", "The sole of these boots is awesome. I wore them at work today. 9-10hrs on my feet. Bottom of my feet were not a problem. My toes also were comfortable. What I didn't expect was for my ankles to start hurting. I had to put on another pair of socks to be able to where them all day. Keeping in mind this is 1st time I wore them. I can definitely see why everyone that buys these give it a high rating for being comfortable. My back stopped hurting after about 2 hours of wearing them.", "Caution!!! This boots will destroy your heel, and the bottom of your feet after just a day, not worth the price, maybe of these were given to you out sold for $0.05.", "Great boot for a cheap price. I got these for work and was surprised when i saw they had a wide foot on here. Its a great buy", "I bought these at a store the 1st time and found them to last longer than anything else I've bought, the second time I got them on amazon because they were cheaper with a better color selection. I'm happy with the second pair as well.", "This is the second pair I bought. The first pair killed my feet until they were broke in after three weeks. I used mink / neets foot oil on them and finally I could wear them. I used the same oil on the second pair and wore them for 2 hours on Saturday without a problem. Don't expect to were them out of the box without treating them. The first pair I have used in industrial construction for a whole year.", "Within a week of having these boots the sole started peeling away and by week two, it had peeled off so bad the shoe was unusable. Very sad to have spent money on this pair of boots. Wish they were as tough as the description said they were. Very comfortable work boot, just couldn\u2019t stand up to everyday all day Farm work.", "Can't change insoles. I bought some insoles and it made the shoe to crowded. My toes started hurting at their base. Changed back to original insoles and the pain went away. Tried multiple different kinds including the recommended ones. All with same result. Upside, boots last year's. Maybe my feet are just too big. Lol. I do recommend but will still look for something else. Mainly because of cost. This is my second pair. Price had gone up considerably from last time I bought them. Durable though but I would like a better insole. If I change the insole it's ingrown toe nails and painful toes. Lol. Hope this helped.", "During the break in period a former in the heel curled in and dug itself into my ankle. So that was kind of painful. Also a lashing rivet popped out first day. Not a great experience really. Does a good job protecting your feet as you would expect.", "Although these boots looks and fits right the b waterproof claim only worked for the first 60 days and now my feet get soaked at work.. I wouldn\u2019t recommend if you work outdoors", "I only gave these boots a four star because the design of the toe has been changed from the last pair of these that I had. The toe is less rounded now and that cut down on the toe room. If I had known that they were redesigned I wouldn't have purchased them. I like the older style better.", "I work as an auto mechanic, and these boots seem to hold up better than most others i've tried. They can take about a year and a half to two years of abuse before they wear out. The soles seem to have good traction on oil-covered surfaces, although they don't do as well through engine coolant. They are comfortable, which is important since I wear them 9 hours a day, six days a week. The steel toe works against a 10 pound sledge and a car driving over my foot; fortunately, I haven't had anything heaver fall on them. They're no Red Wings, but for less than $80, they're darn good boots. This is my fourth pair in ten years.", "These shoes are excellently made!!! Couldn't be better constructed !!! I ordered 12 wide. My husbands feet are very wide but I was hoping they would fit, because this boot is made so sturdy!! To my dissapointment they weren't wide enough for him!! I had to return them and my return was so fast and easy! I can't say enough about the quility of the boot and the service I received!! Excellent!! I will buy again from this site!!", "Try them on before ordering online, safety shoes run a bit small with the steel toes. I knew that and did so mine fit great. Had a pair previously and they were outstanding. Price was much cheaper than what i could by them for locally. You wont be disappointed.", "Great all around workboot. Not heavy at all and enough support for long days standing and moving around. I know I've become a supporter of this boot for a regular yearly workbook. I go through a few pairs in a year so the quality surprised the price in my book. I work with Asetone and Thinners at work so they are rough enough to withstand decent exposure to chemicals without wearing too bad. I'm definitely buying these again.", "Well nothing special about these boots really. My best description would be these are just ok. They aren't particularly light or comfortable, if you have more sensitive feet these wont be real comfortable even with gel insoles.", "I wear a 10.5, wide, when I first put them on I was a little worried, but the boot is soft within the first hour they had broke in, I'm a propane tech in and out of trucks in all kinds of weather, feet stay dry, very comfortable boot. I did a lot of research on boots and these are as expected. I will continue to buy.", "Would like this boot. But only after maybe an hour, it started hurting my toes. After an 8 or a 10 hour shift, my toes are on fire and in extreme pain. Which in turn causes the rest of my foot to be in pain. Only wish the toe area had a little bit more room in it. If it did it would be a good boot.", "Good boot so far, little tight in toe, but that will loosen up as they get broke in. Good boot at a week out. They are heavy.", "I bought these boots for my husband. He is super hard on boots. Originally I thought these were a little overpriced but decided to give them a try because of all the great reviews. We're both so thankful I did! These are very well made and keep his feet protected and dry. These boots are heavy. I tell him I can wear these around the house instead of ankle weights. If you're looking for an exceptional work boot that also looks nice them you need not look any further!!", "I bought these boots because they were rated high for help with Plantar Fasciitis; after a week of wearing them to work every day, I must admit my feet are improving! I feel pretty good about this purchase!", "These are to replace a pair of Railroad Timberland safety shoes I had for 2 years and still wearing for my Motorcycle rides for 8 years after retirement. My old Timberland boots are scratched, cut and scuffed and just about worn out. The reason I bought these is they are more water tight and will be Beading water after I treat them! Real good traction on rough and crumbly and other slippery surfaces so I don't drop my bike. Nice!", "My husband wears these every day from morning until late at night. He is a carpenter, and will not wear any other boots. They are sturdy and comfortable.", "I bought these for my husband and he has been wearing them for a couple months now and likes them. He had bought a more expensive pair, different brand but well known brand and they fell apart. These have been holding up to his rigorous schedule.", "I am replacing an older pair of these that wore out. NO WAY IN THE WORLD these are Wides. Thank goodness for free returns.", "Feels good immediately. Well built, solid construction. I've bought these boots for the last 8 yrs, yearly, needed or not. I'm rough on work boots and this boot holds up well", "I work anywhere from 4-16 hours a day on my feet, and then wear these at home until I'm ready to pop them off and put on some house shoes and relax.... These boots fit great, feel great, dont slide when im working on a greasy fast food restauraunt floor in after coming in from the rain with WET FEET!!! I love these boots. Hands down beats the Dickie's boots i purchased, and the comfort is ridiculous. Padding on the ankle, the inner steel toe, the tongue, it all adds up to a boot that can be worn the hell out of.", "I ordered this for my brother because he just moved and was wearing his old boots to work and would always come home with some feet. He tried these and says they were great! He said its been a long time since he's had good working shoes that actually fit him perfectly! Thanks Amazon!", "High quality boots. My budget allowed for boots 2x the price and I'm still very happy. I have high arches and size 12 sneaker so I ordered these boots in 11.5 (great fit) and I must use the Dr. Sholle's CF340 for these boots to be bearable on my arches. Comfortable all day, all weather.", "I purchased these boots to work around the farm and needed something that I could wear all day without killing my feet. At first I had issues with the right boot rubbing on the outside of my right ankle and causing pain. I stretched the boot on that side and that helped. I then pushed the tongue over so that it would cover the seam and that helped. Now I can wear the boots without issue.", "I was using a paid of similar work boots but of clearly lesser quality and my feet were killing me. From the moment I received these boots and slid them on, my feet have been thanking me. The support is great and I have been wearing them for 8+ hours a day since I received them. My feet and legs feel just as good at the end of the day as they did in the morning when I started out. If you need good support and a comfortable steel-toe work boot, this is the one to get. Size was perfect for me, just make sure you know what size and width you need prior to ordering.", "The shoes are durable so far, I'd advise to MAYBE order a size up because there is not a lot of room in the toe area. The shoe gets more comfortable as the day goes on which is nice. I use the shoe for hard labor and so far they have held up well. As long as you wash off any liquid that gets on them and you oil them accordingly they should last you. I'll update in the future again!", "First time buyer for these boots and was excited was told will take time to break these in. But one of the boots fits tighter around the steel toe thinking there is a issue with bent metal maybe? This has caused extreme pain in one of my feet and I can no longer wear the boots. Should have reached out and got a new pair the day I received them. But the other foot loved the experience haha \ud83d\ude04", "Good pair of work boots after 2 weeks. I always buy semi rigid Arch supports for all my footwear so I really don't have any insight on the arch support. I suspect that I be satisfied going forward and will consider bing a new pair next time I need safety work boots.", "I was worried about steel-toed shoes hurting my feet but these boots look and feel great. I am glad I made the purchase.", "The boot does wear on the inside of the ankles quite a bit. The big problem is that the upper shoestring hooks are either too small or angled wrong or both so that the strings will not stay hooked when tightening them up. Finally gave up entirely on the top two and just use the bottom ones but they still take 3-4 tries before I can get them to hold long enough to tighten the strings and tie.", "I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend & he loves them. He stated that they are the most comfortable boots he's ever had! He works long hours/days in the steel industry & he highly recommends these!!", "These boots have held up great for a couple Months now. The break in period took about 9 days. After that they are very comfortable.", "Seams are not holding well, for a supposed work boot it doesn\u2019t hold up. Comfy but obviously with seams coming apart in no time at all, drafty and leaves your feet wet", "Sizing with shoes is always a nightmare. I can wear anything between an 8 and an 11, depending on the brand and style. Size 10 seems to be my sweet spot, not too loose, not to tight. I'd say I'm an average width size 10, so that's what I ordered these in. They fit perfect and are extremely comfortable. I could see how ordering these too small, or synching them down too tight would make the steel toe uncomfortable (same with any boot I guess). Initial quality seems very high - good quality, tough leather, thick durable sole, etc. I haven't had these boots for very long, but, as of right now, I would definitely recommend them.", "I love these boots. Very comfortable to walk in. Only reason I have not given 5 stars is I want to see how long they last before they fall apart. I am hoping it last longer than another brand I use to wear which only lasted one month before ripping at the seams.", "These boots are a good Buy! I've worn them several times and already my feet thank me. They are comfortable and have protected my ankles and toes already. I've been splitting a lot of wood and have dropped wood at and near my feet and these boots protected me feet.", "I bought these boots because I am on my feet for almost 11 hours a day. I had purchased other work boots and nothing helped my aching feet. These boots have really improved my aching feet. I reviewed many work boots before deciding on buying these. I am gald I did.", "Very nice and comfortable boot. I have had a couple of pairs of these type boots from Timberland and these are definitely the most comfortable", "One of the most uncomfortable boots i have ever worn, i have tried a couple of different brands looking for the best and most comfortable, but this definitely is not... I got blisters in my heels after one day of use, even though they fit as expected. I am not buying Timberland again. I gave it 2 stars because they fit as expected and they look good.", "Looks great but it's quite narrow, making a not so comfortable shoes especially if you use thick socks. I have others timberland shoes and never had this problem.", "Second time buying these. They last longer than any boot I\u2019ve ever bought and I climb cell phone towers for a living and put them through hell.", "I wore my first pair every day to work for about 6 years!!!! I've honestly never had a pair of shoes (any style) that were more comfortable than these boots. I had to buy 2-3 pairs of insoles as the original ones wore out. No big deal. Finally after six years I had to retire them. The tread was gone and starting to separate from the boot. All other shoes I've owned would have been in worse shape in half the time. Thank goodness I was able to find another pair of the exact same ones. I can't brag enough how comfortable and durable these are.", "First 8.5 they were a little tight so I returned those for a 9 and they fit. Amazon was great! In fact, I had 1 pair (sketchers boots) stolen from my house at delivery. Amazon took care of those shoes for me. I reordered same shoe and it was too small, so they took those back. Thats when I ordered these shoes they are comfortable, and well made. Worth the price. I recommend these boots.", "Good boot. Only downfall is I feel these are going to fail within 6 months. Upon arrival some of the stitching seems loose on the rubber sole and white scuff looking marks in multiple spots. Possible I got a return of worn boots or just a lack of quality control. Owned 3 pair of regular Tim's and none had these issues.", "I love Timberland work boots. They outlast than the brands you spend $200-$300 on. That\u2019s what Timberland does. Make boots. Why would you buy anything else!!?", "My guy loves his early Fathers Day present! He says they are tough but comfy for his construction job. Hes on his feet so much, he deserves quality boots. This is his 2nd pr. Last ones lasted 2yrs of almost everyday use.", "Love the softness and looks it has. Great comfort, and I been a fan of the lace up since I tried them the first time. The ankle support is impeccable. Would buy again", "My husband wears a 10.5, but we ordered a size 11 based on other reviews, it also turned out the 11 was a lot cheaper than the 10.5 so we probably would have tried them anyways. I'm so glad we did, my husband says they fit perfectly and are very comfortable.", "Only had bout week but so far LOVIN them. Only complaint is the black leather is a bit chalky so definitely have to get some boot polish when you buy these. Other than that great so far. And I wear size 15 shoe so ordered size 15 boot and was right size.", "This shoe is very good, just as everything I expect from timberland. 4 years later I still have it. Very durable", "Great work boots. I didn't even bother breaking them in before starting eight hour work days in them, however, after a week I can jog in these real easy. I'm comparing these to my coworkers boots: These souls are still great after one month, these boots can take a hit and still look good, not made of cheap coating, can step in puddles without getting wet. My coworker boots are from cheap-mart and look like garbage after one month.", "These are nice boots but the insoles are paper thin so I highly recommend getting new insoles when ordering, I got some memory foam insoles and they helped a lot. I wear these boots everyday at work for 12 hours in a factory and so far they have held up well, not all that comfortable but generally steel toe boots aren\u2019t.", "My husband sent a link and asked for these specifically, so that I would be sure to get the correct replacement boots. HE LOVES THEM!", "Replaced some other Timberland PRO that I had for 3 years, so the fitment was expected as I got the same size I originally had. Despite being a different style/model of boot, I was happy to find out that the sizing remained the same. Not the most comfortable boots initially, my other pair broke in quicker since I was more active but after two weeks they felt fine despite now having an office job. Even outside though, they're tough and aside from minor scuffs look brand new.", "My son wore these for 2 and a half months. The bottom came off. I paid to send them back (to Timberland) and was told because they looked beat up they didn't meet the warranty requirements. Should work boots look nice? Should the bottom fall aff after 2 1/2 months. We will not be buying Timberland anymore.", "The boot is of solid build and does what it was intended for. My only issue is the lack of padding around the ankles. I've tried breaking them in for almost 4 weeks, but the right boot has given me such bad bruising around my ankle I can hardly walk while wearing these boots. I'd recommend finding a pair of boots with a lot of cushion support for your ankles.", "Worst shoes ever. My husband has bought these same ones before and they have not peeled off this this. It\u2019s been 3 weeks of using and look how they are. Please don\u2019t waist your money, it\u2019s better to pay full price on the actual Timberland store. Not worth the $100 I spent so disappointed.", "They feel light which is awesome the previous 2017 model were heavy. Quality is perfect Made In Dominican Republic my country jeje. They fit perfectly I just love them.", "I've purchased the same boots on a brown color in a different store and they were by far the most comfortable boots I've ever tried. When I received my black boots from Amazon I couldn't believe in the quality difference. On my first time wearing them, I ended up with blisters and in so much pain that I was out for dinner on Valentine's day and just couldn't walk on those anymore, and ended up walking back home barefoot. Extremely disappointed with this purchase. Product returned", "These are the best work boots I\u2019ve ever had by far! I work on a freight dock and as a supervisor I usually walk 10+ miles a day so needless to say comfort is important. These are the only ones I haven\u2019t needed to get a gel insole for! They\u2019re tough as can be I\u2019ve snagged them on nails, the edges of dock plates, broken pallets etc and they\u2019re still going strong! I HIGHLY recommend these!", "The only down side is that the boots had a spot on them and on closer review, had scuff marks etc. They are work boots and they will eventually mget scuffs etc. It's just when you pay for something new, you expect it to be new. It made me think these had been returned and sold as new. I'm not sure what to think. The boots fit perfect, true to size. These look great, comfortable and they are awesome boots.", "Great boot. Feels comfortable even on 12 hr days. Runs a little small. I'm usually 10 1/2 or 11 depending on the boot. I purchased an 11. 11 1/2 would have been perfect.", "I received these in a timely fashion and a very happy with them yes I would recommend These Boots very comfortable I work on a hard concrete floor in a warehouse climbing on and off of forklifts of various sizes and my feet are comfortable and my ankles are supported my back doesn't hurt very pleased with this product.", "THIS IS THE FIFTH PAIR I HAVE BOUGHT. THE BEST. WELL MADE. BEAUTIFUL. STURDY, COMFORTABLE, GOOD SUPPORT, GREAT VALUE. I WILL BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN.", "I gave these as a birthday gift. The recipient seemed happy with them, but I don't know much about their experience with them.", "These were an AMAZING! Buy. This was my uncles Christmas gift and he loved it, he was completely SHOCKED! They fit him great! They also saved his foot many times. Because hes an electrician things tend to fall on his foot a lot and got hurt because he would wear plain Nikes, mostly because he couldn't afford Timberlands. Neither can I but I thought why not he deserves it, since then when things fall on his feet he doesn't feel a thing! He even wears them as dress shoes and they look GREAT!", "While my husband would never wear these in public as a fashion statement, they definitely served their purpose when he was an HVAC tech climbing roofs and making his way through yards for repairs. They fit definitely as expected and they were comfortable enough for him to wear them all day long. He has pretty flat feet so he didn't worry too much about arch support but they were comfortable on what littlearch he has. These are great work boots.", "These are my husband's favorite brand and style of work boot. He's a supervisor in a warehouse setting, walking many miles a night on concrete floors. These last and he says they are the most comfortable work boot he's owned. Price point here on Amazon has beat all other places so I return to place an order for a new pair every six months or so. These last much longer, but I like him to look his best. These will easily last much longer, with replacing the insoles.", "Great Work boots so far. They've been very comfortable even with just the regular insoles. I usually have to add insoles to many of my shoes, but so far they've been comfortable enough without them. I ended up buying a half size smaller than I usually do for regular shoes. I normally wear a 12 but decided to get an 11.5 and they fit perfectly. Unless something happens down the road to change my mind, I'll definitely be sticking with this brand.", "The boot is well made but I've found a better option. The traction on this sole is extremely poor. They slip / slide terribly (including a slip on some ice in January which resulted in several broken ribs.) This motivated me to move on to the more-expensive-but-worth-it Wolverine \"Glacier Ice\" boot.", "This is a great pair of boots. Steel-toe means you don't have to worry about stubbed toes. It is very warm (I live near Boston) in the winter, however, you may consider buying a waterproofer since this is not waterproof - HOWEVER I have not had any wet feet while wearing this, I only recommend waterproofer because the material can absorb water sometimes. Just a recommendation. These boots are very comfortable, although on the heavy side. They have very good grip, feel sturdy. I advise you not to wear ankle length or no-show socks with these because the metal hoops for the laces can sometimes rub against your skin and cause discomfort. A very good pair of boots, would recommend.", "Boots came in with scrapes and dirt on them like they were used. I did test fit them and the steel toe had my toes squeezed together so make sure you get a size bigger. Also one of the suspension things on the bottom were poping, and had what felt like plastic jamming in my heal.", "Liner inside the boot had a fold of excess material right on the heel. Made them extremely uncomfortable to where. Felt like a knife cutting into my heel.", "These are the perfect price point for typical employer reimbursement ($90-120 in my experience). This is the second set I've purchased and my employers have paid for. These lasted me about 2 years in a severe duty application. Only issue is the insole that comes with the shoe is useless an will wear out quickly. A set of Dr. Scholl's inserts fixes this and feels much better on the foot.", "These are good shoes for work. I was disappointed that they were made in Asia. Usually Asian made items fall short on quality. We'll see if these last as long as my Superior American made Red Wing shoes.", "Surprised that the steel toe version was a couple of bucks less than the soft toe pit boss, so I went with it. Happy with the fit and comfort and I'm pretty picky with my footwear. One star deducted because I'm not happy with the grip on the soles- I've noticed this deficiency with other Timberland products in the past, though.", "Fit perfectly right out of the box. The last pair were not comfortable until I got the soaking wet working in a rain storm. After that they were perfect so I expected the same with my new pair. But to my delight they fit perfectly from day one. They are a solid, comfortable work boot giving me dependable sure footing wherever I\u2019m working. Very pleased with them.", "I bought this steel toe boots for work and the size is wide but my little toe is hurting.. I don't know they could replacement for me or not..", "Have used these for about 4 months now. The price i beleive is fair, was advertised as a tough working boot, i normally work 12 hour days sometimes longer than that. in these four months of use it feels loose now. I tighten them almost as much as possible and they seem ok, maybe not as comfortable as qhen they were new. When they were new out of the box i found they were better than most other boots i have used. (before i used ariats and timberland pro)", "THIS PRODUCT AT THIS POINT, SEEMS THE BE ONE OF THE BEST BOOTS THAT I'VE EVER OWNED, THE STITCH LOOKS VERY WELL PLACED, THE PRODUCT SHOULD LAST ME FOR A VERY LONG TIME, I HOP TO GET AT LEAST FIVE YEARS OUT OF THE BOOT, I SPIT SHINNED THE BOOTS TODAY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO WEARING THE BOOTS AND SHOWING THEM OFF TO MY FRIENDS, THE FISRST PAIR LASTED ME TWO YEARS, SO I PURCHASED THE BOOTS AGAIN, THAT IS AN OUTSTANDING TRACK RECORD FOR ME AS A SECURITY OFFICER, I PLACE A GREAT DEAL OF MILES ON BOOTS.....", "Love these boots so far. I work in the oilfield so i needed something that was insulated, non-slip, water resistant, and steel toe - and these certainly do the trick. Only took about 2 days to break in (and really didn't need to at all), and theyve been very durable and versatile. I've worn them in temps from 10 to 90 degrees F and they've been great in all weather. They've taken a beating over the last 2 months and are still in great shape, also very easy to clean. Very satisfied for the price. Great value.", "These fit exactly to size and felt broken in from day 1. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great pair of work boots. I use mine for construction every day and they still look brand new!", "These boots are great but I have just 1 problem. The heel has this hard part that rubs up against my heel and I can see it causing blisters for a bit. Docked a start for that. That being said, these boots are high quality and I can see them lasting a very long time!", "Been using them for work installing marble showers. It's been about 2 weeks and the loop on the back of one of the boots used to help slide your feet in already ripped while trying to put my shoes on. I dont wear wear my them to tight so it broke very easy. The boots are comfortable and look nice but I just hope they dont start falling apart already.", "Left boot was defective. Sole was maligned with leather body. Returned. Cant decide if I want to try the Timberlands again.... I expected better quality control from the brand, especially considering that this is their \"Pro\" line.", "I got these boots thinking they would last forever. They fit great, and I was impressed by the the quality of the leather and soles. However, after only two months, the riveted lace holders on both shoes broke! It's now impossible to get the laces tight enough and I'm getting blisters. Would definitely have bought another pair if they were say, 5 years old. But after two months? I'll get something else to replace them.", "The top lace loop popped out the first time I tried to lace up the boots. I received a replacement pair and they worked for one day. The second day I tried to lace up the boots the top lace loop popped out as well. I have had a pair of brown boots (same model) for well over a year and the worked fine. Something about the black ones not being riveted in very well. I will re-order the brown ones and hope to have better luck.", "Great boot if you're on your feet all day. My father, an auto mechanic, has worn these shoes for the past two years. He has reported that they do not break down or crack as easily as the cheaper boots do (when he bends his foot). He loved these boots so much, that I bought him another pair.", "High quality of materials and construction. Very comfortable on day one - no need to break in. They feel lighter on the foot than expected. Bought a half size larger than regular shoes, providing more ventilation without feeling too loose.", "After breaking in the shoes they felt just right, will definitely buy again.", "I think the product is cutting costs. My last pair lasted a long time. The pair I got 2 months ago already is worn down to the steel on the toe! The actual leather is really thin covering the steel toe. Like cheesy thin. I'm a Mason so I abuse boots", "Just got mine in today and have to say these are so comfortable. Being a volunteer firefighter and being outside for long period of times I can already tell these are gonna be great. I tested to see how they would do in water since they say they're not waterproof. Boots 1 - Deep puddle 0. I was hesitant to get these but for $100 you get what you pay for. Im interested to see how long they last for from what I heard from other reviews. They're not heavy at all and are very comfortable. Keep up the good work Timberland Pro I will definitely be buying from you guys again.", "A little tighter than expected. Maybe with time it will break in but I recommend buying a size up.", "If you have any kind of wide foot, get the wide. I returned the wide boot after trading in the 9.5 m and still was to narrow. Not a wide boot at all. Almost meant for a women and not a man.", "Got them for my husband and he likes them. I got no complaint so far so good. He works in construction and he had already used up his last pair.", "I bought these as a gift for a landscaper friend who goes thru work boots like crazy (usually the $30-40 brands), so I wanted to treat him and his feet to a GOOD pair of boots. I've had Timberland products before and after reading reviews of Caterpillar and Die-hard, etc. I choose Timberland. I would like to give a better review in a few months to see how well they have stood up to his wear and tear. This is someone who walks at least 10 miles a day (to and from work) then puts in a 10-12 hour day landscaping. I pray that they will be a winner!!!", "I needed some new boots and I kinda have a thing for steel toe these days. I was replacing some old worn out Doc Martens I got from ebay that were always a little too big and got to be painful and heavy, i just thought thats they price you pay for steel toe. Not the case with these babies. They have that great Timberland comfort that just holds your foot nicely and you can't feel the steel in the toe either, after wearing them for 6-8hrs a day. If you tie them too tight up top, it can strangle your ankle and dig the tongue in, but they don't need to be so tight in the first place.", "The fit was fine, but they\u2019re super heavy. If I wear this for work all day, which can be 12+ hours they\u2019ll kill my back.", "Boot was fine. Prime wardrobe order. Just not what we needed. Price was a little high", "Great boot, somewhat small, but that's what all the reviews said, it had to be broken in. I don't know if the receiver has given it enough of a chance to break in or not, he loves the boot, but still experience discomfort with 12 hours + worth of wear.", "These boots are to big on the left side, just right on the other side. It makes walking very difficult, you windup with a slight limp. If you stuff it with cloth or paper it helps for a hour or two.. then you have redo it every few hours.. until your 12 hour shift is over... for me it\u2019s a hassle to go into the restroom and preform this task every few hours..", "These boots fit very well. They are comfortable to wear for several hours each day, even though they aren't really broken in completely. I did apply an oil to (hopefully) speed up the break in process, but they were quite comfortable right out of the box. The only minor complaint I have is that the tongue seems quite stiff, and it rubs against my ankle. Hopefully, this will ease as they are broken in more. Would recommend these boots.", "This is a great boot but it runs very wide. I am a size 12. Have been for plenty of years with plenty of different shoes and boots. These feel a bit like clown shoes and when you pull the laces to tie them, the leather wrinkles up before the boot feels snug around your feet. still, the feel under your foot is very comfortable. They loosen up and feel nice after a couple of days and kind of fell like gel inserts are in them. Nice quality I think, just wish I went with maybe an 11.5.", "I don\u2019t usually write reviews, but I feel it\u2019s important this time so that other people don\u2019t go through what I had to go to with this product. This boots made my ankle bleed it feels so hard on every step. I only could wear it the first day and by the second day I had to wear sneakers. The boots are very heavy compare with others boots steel toe on the market. I had to return it and bought other brand that I found more comfortable.", "Appears to be great fit and quality. Used several times around house for yard work. I really like the flap that prevents trash getting into the booths.", "Awesome boots! I love the Timberland line of work boots, it's tough to find anything that fits me very well and is comfortable, but these do the trick, I even use them for every day footwear now. There wasnt much of a break-in needed, they were very comfortable right out of the box. I've been wearing them for over a year now and even though they're scuffed up, they're still in great condition and I expect them to last at least another year if not more.", "I have plantar fasciitis and it is hard to find a work boot that will keep my feet comfortable all day. These do the job. They're steel toe and heavy duty. They do not pinch my feet at all. I can easily squat in them. The leather is absolutely real leather and they are very easy to clean. I felt like they were broken in on day one. I highly recommend these!", "These have higher arches than a lot of other boots. They seem to provide better support. This is my second pair. My last pair was three years old and finally wore out. The boots weren't bad looking, but after a few thousand miles of walking, the soles were worn out. These are great quality. Most other brands of boot like Redwings or Caterpillar were breaking down on me after 6 months. Great value for the price.", "My brother in law started a new job and needed some really good work boots so we went with these. they are very nice and fit him really well he got them in a size 10.5 w in a black color they fit him just right. After a couple of weeks of using them he said they are very comfortable to wear and stand around in all day long. He is very happy with them and for the price well worth it.", "This is the second pair of these I've had. Both have had the top hooks pop off when I was putting them on. It's sad to see how far the quality of these boots have dropped.", "Bought this 2019 early year shoe is nice and not too uncomfortable but not slip resistance learned that today so they nice for cold and warm weather not rain tho.", "Only wore them q minth and the bottom insole is falling off of the left heel", "Great boots! These replace a similar pair of Timberlands that I beat the heck out of for more than a decade before the sole tore way. The fit isn't glove-like, but with just a bit of time they will break in nicely. I'm on my tractor and handling equipment such as chain saws, so the steel toe is really important to me, especially when kicking stuff out of frustration (rocks, frozen chunks of mud, tires). Highly recommend!", "As many others have noted, these are indeed very comfortable after a short breakin period. I have had these for about 6 months now. I treated them up front with Leather Honey Conditioner before putting them into service ... I can wear these all day (on weekends) and I don't end up in pain at the end of the day. Seem solid built and good around the yard, garage etc. Expect to get many years of service from them. Will update if there is any unexpected change to my opinion.", "I bought these for my oldest son who does demolition when he is home from college in the summer. He said they were great. Kept his toes safe when heavy objects fell on them and great for kicking down walls. He also said they were comfortable. Good price and value.", "Bought these for my boyfriend who is a HVAC technician. He says that they are very comfortable through out the day. He\u2019s normally pretty harsh on his boots, and he has had these pair of boots for about a month now and they still look brand new. I\u2019ll be buying these again for whenever he wears his other set out!", "Purchased for my father who walks all day on his feet doing general maintenance in an office building he works at Mon-Fri. His old shoes started to look like they could talk since the front lip had come undone from the sole of the shoe. He's been using them since Christmas, and he tells me that he is much more comfortable and enjoys walking in them all day. When you look at the shoe itself, it is also a nice looking boot to look at.", "Bought these for work, I\u2019m on my feet 10 hours a day. They fit great and have good foot support.", "I wear a size 9 and I got this boot in a 9.5. It fits but when I put a cushion in it, as I always do, it\u2019s too tight. But, I\u2019ve owned this moot before and I like it. I wish they came with better quality laces but I can replace them. Overall they are great boots.", "Was nervous to buy these, but glad i did! Fit true to size and very comfortable for a somewhat cheap pair of boots. The tan ones look great right out of the box", "The quality of these boots is impressive. Very nice and durable they would seem. Too bad they didnt fit me. Im a size 12 normaly but these timberlands in a 12 were much too loose. And the 11.5s? Way too tight! I ended up getting some sketchers steel toe boots in an 11.5 and those seem to fit much better. 3 stars for the look and feel of the quality.", "Lost water proof after 1 week of light use I bought half a size bigger then I wear and they still felt really tight", "Great workbook. I've worn this brand and style for years. Always happy with them.", "I usually wear a 10 regular width, bought that size first, too tight and narrow, went with a 10.5 wide, perfect comfortable fit. I used the free shipping and they were delivered in 2 days. Would definitely buy again!", "That saying you get what you pay for? Well these are failry expensive compared to others however the quality and built is there, if yo want a good pair of quality working boots you can't go wrong with these.", "The boots are really good, water proof and strong, I love the Leather and the color, I\u2019ve been using these boots for two months already and they have been working really nice.", "Not all shoes are created equal. Steel toes included. I have worn other brands of work boots from different price points. But these Timberlands fit like a glove. I work for a major freight company ( I won't say which one) and I am on my feet all day. The padding in these boots provides much appreciated comfort for my feet. They are not too heavy either. These boots are as tough as can be. I like that there are hooks at the top instead of holes. I highly recommend these boots. At retail stores you can easily pay over $100. Which is to be expected for the name brand. But I got these for under $75!!", "The perfect boot. Tried 3 other similar boots... others were not even close to the fit and finish of this one.", "Purchased for my fiance for Christmas and he loved them!", "Speed lace pulled off 5th use had to put new pop rivet, so far water proof stiff sole comfortable boot, not much use yet.", "This is my second pair of the Timberland Pro Pitboss 6-inch steel toed boots. I've developed a blister on my right ankle bone in the first two days of wearing these. There's a seam coming down that doesn't seem well-padded, which hits my ankle bone exactly and caused the blister. I don't recall having this problem with the first pair. Once they're broken in, I expect them to be as comfortable as the first pair, and a lot better than RedW_ngs.", "Great boots. Only brand i buy anymore. I use for work, around the house and in the woods. I can put these on right out of the box and never had an issue! No need to break in.", "I wear these five days a week as an auto mechanic. They are exposed to water, grease, chemicals and abrasion and usually last me almost two years. I do a lot of squatting and have destroyed the toe box of many other boots, these have always held up. I did manage to rip off one of the upper lace loops on a ladder on my last pair, but I don't fault the boot. Both previous pairs were replaced because I wore through the soles. I've had dozens of other brands that never made it that long.", "These boots are great. I was hesitant to get a steel-toed boot because I figured it would be extremely stiff and uncomfortable. But I really needed a steel toe because heavy stumps tend to fall on my feet when I'm out cutting wood. So I got these, and they turned out to be more comfortable than a lot of boots I've had that didn't have a steel toe. They also seem extremely well made. I got them for around $100 and feel that that's a bargain. If I lost them tomorrow, I'd probably be willing to pay twice that to get another pair.", "Been through a lot with these boots and now the inside padding is starting to wear, but two year run with these boots is pretty good. No complaints, they lasted longer than the Dr. Martins I bought before these.", "These fit great out of the box. Very good quality overall. Solid construction. I love them", "Most uncomfortable pair of boots I've ever owned !! I'm 44 and have always worked construction jobs, point blank these boots suck!", "If your foot is shaped like a banana get the regular size, otherwise go for the wide version. It's like the steel toe eats into the space inside the boot. I'm normally a size 9, had to send those back for a 9 wide, which I've never bought in any other shoe or boot in my life. 9W does fit my normally size 9 feet fine though.", "I've had these boots before and sware by them. I had to the wide width, so don't talk trash until u tried the wide. It makes a big difference people.", "These boots were fro my boyfriend, they fit him perfectly. He is an auto mechanic so he works around a lot of those nasty fluids that come from vehicle. Theses boots keep his feet safe from any damage. He says they are comfortable for our long walks as well.", "Works great for construction site visits and volunteering shifts once a month, things like that. Not super comfortable that I would want to wear them every day but works great and looks professional for what I need it for.", "The toe is very cramped. Had to get a shoe size larger to use. Will not be getting replacements here after the current pair wear out. NOTE: If you do buy these BUY THEM THE NEXT SIZE UP. The toe is too small for the stated size. If you're a size 11 buy a 12.", "Buying boots online I worry, \"will it fit?\" This one was right on target.", "i've always been a fan of timberland products and bought a pair of these steel toes over 10 years ago. i have been buying them ever since. i do electrical work and am on my feet alot and find them quite comfortable and not too heavy. the boot usually last me about 16 months and then i buy a new pair. they look great fitted with a pair of black carhartts whether your at the club or the construction site guaranteed you'll be g'd out!", "I purchased these for my son for work previously. They last a long time. When it came time for new ones, he wanted these again because of the comfort.", "Great winter boots here in Chicago. I added some new insoles which make them much more comfortableand some Sno Sealfor waterproofing. They do require some break in, which I would do while it's still warm and you soften the leather with Sno Seal or mink oil. Be aware that the tread is somewhat flat, and does not have an aggressive tread on the bottom. For working on flat or industrial surfaces, it's an ideal tread.", "Stiff as a board. Took too long to break (over 3 wks). Rubbed the skin raw around the ankle. I didn't use any products to try and soften them. I needed these for work and was hobbling around the job site.", "This boot will stand up to basically anything. yes steel toe might be overkill be its good to have. and have to say they are incredibly comfortable and do not get my feet too hot. . . These boots are must haves for the price of $86. . I can fit a boot knife in them no problem. This is great because it is a six inch boot. Overall, great boots and I strongly recommend purchasing them. fast shipping which is great. fast lace up so you put them on and them off in a breeze. high quality leather, slip resistant, oil resistant. Worth the money, it is a bargain!!", "We received used boots. Including dirt and mud attached to the bottom. Extremely disappointed.", "The toe box is fairly tight on these i hope it loosens up during break in. Previously had the 6in boondocks and those were very roomy boots and I'd always blow out the sides and it felt like I had a lot of slop ill update this review after breakin", "I received what I ordered. Medium width is barely ok for me. If in doubt, I would recomend the wide width.", "Never had foot problems till I wore these boots, they fell apart very quickly and are cheaply made", "After doing some research the general consensus was these run big by 1 size over nike. so i wear an 11 in Nike and the pitboss in size 10 fit perfect. with that said, they're awesome after a few days of use. once they mold to your foot they're very comfortable. 5/5", "Great boots, buy a 1/2 size up and wider than normal for best fit.", "They are great work boot but they are stylish enough to wear out and around town", "Extra durable I recommend them and i will buy another pair. I am not standing all day so I can't tell you how well they would feel for all day comfort but I've worn them about 2 years and they are great.", "This is the second pair of Timberland Pit Boss steel toes I have purchased. From the experience with the first pair I bought these and they are as expected. The fit is a little loose with a lite weight sock so I wear a heavy boot sockand the fit is perfect. They do need a little break in yet but are getting more comfortable everyday. All in all I am satisfied with my purchase.", "The outward appearance is professional looking and the fit is good. I love the fact that it is insulated. I hope that the quality is better than the last Timberland I bought for my son. The soles of that boot fell apart one year of wear. Timberland has a guarantee on their products but now quite sure how to go about complaining to them. Amazon filled my order in record time. It was delivered on the date they noted. Customer service is great.", "We were very impressed with these from the moment we opened the box, really nice, good quality boots! They do run a bit small. My husband usually wears a 13W and we had to return the first pair we ordered for a 14W. (Great customer service! Fast and easy to exchange!) After we got the right size, my husband said that they are very comfortable, he loves them!", "Another pair of Tims, another classic bad-ace boot! These things are the real deal and for the money you WILL NOT find a better buy. FORGET all of those other brands TImberlands are by far the best work boot on the market today. This is my 4th pair of Tims workboots in a row and I will not go back to any other brand EVER.", "Visually the boot looks great. BUT after wrenching in them at for hours my ankle started hurting. Not because they were uncomfortable but because in the ankle support area of the boot, it feels as if there is some plastic mold piece in there that was just stabbing my ankle. I even tried double socking and even an anke brace and it still eventually ended up bruising and after just using them for 3 days im taking the L on them and going back to my original pair of timberland boots. I do NOT recommend these boots.", "The last pair of Timberland Pro I had lasted six years!! These are extremely comfortable. I could wear them all day. I highly recommend these boots.", "The product itself is very well designed. My husband still hasn't found the right size. He wears a 7.5, which didnt fit. We exchanged them for an 8. Still too small. Re-ordered a 8.5 still too small. Returned waiting for a size 9. Hoping they fit!", "Purchased for a Christmas gift. These unfortunately run small, make sure to order a half size up at least. Once we got the correct size, my brother loved these. Great boot.", "I wear a 9.5. Needed a 10. And i have a slight arch in my foot. Started hurting my feet after a few days. Even with inserts. Wanted to like them, but being on my feet all day i need something comfortable. And these werent it.", "I wore my old boots all day for a few weeks and developed severe foot pain. I was off my feet for two days. I looked online and bought these asap and so far these are the only shoes i can wear while the foot pain subsides. The sole is extremely comfortable and even better than other soles i have bought. Point blank great boots, and steel toe is the icing on the cake, which by the way i can't even tell is there. Good Job", "Do not purchase. They are too large for the size you order. As a result be wary on any product from this manufacturer. I ordered two pair and now I am stuck with too large of shoes.", "My husband loves them from the first time he wore them.", "The boot is just ok, it fits to true size, and from multiple reviews all say the boot is good for walking on hard surfaces, well for 4days the front part of the boot there is no support the heal is fine but the upper part of my feet is sore by the end of day, i have hiker timberlands which can be worn all day with no issues", "Arrived super fast. Fit perfectly on my son who is extremely picky about the fit of his shoes. Wore them for a couple of months and the eyelets for the laces got loose. One went missing. I've contacted the seller twice but got no response. They are good shoes but if there's a problem don't count on this seller to help.", "Currently have a 2 year old pair that I wore almost every day. Still not ready to retire them, justwanted a second one pair for when one gets wet.", "Had a pair of these that lasted 3 years and so I bought the exact same replacements. The new boots I received fit the same as the older pair and work great for me. Will buy again when the time comes.", "Received two separate orders and either both were factory seconds or quality control at Timberland is lacking. The first pair the hooks were completely misaligned on the right boot. On the second pair the right boot eyelets did not line up correctly. I returned the first pair and I am awaiting to return the second pair. Otherwise the boots seem comfortable, for what little time I tried them on.", "Best boots I ever owned. I work in construction and I'm walking on tar rocks mud cement water nails ladders what ever a construction site may throw at them. They are comfortable durable and they last me a good 10 months. I put these boots through hell on a daily basis. No other boot last me this long 3 months is all I could get out of the other boots. I'm on my 2nd pair and I don't think I'll be getting any other kind of boots strongly recommend these boots to anyone in construction.", "I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE. WORKS FOR WHAT I USE IT FOR. A LOT OF WALKING ON VARIOUS CONSTRUCTION SITES.", "These things were like walking on a cloud. My planter facites was killing me and these boots were the ones that worked best. They are comfortable for all day on concrete and are rugged too.", "3rd pair in 5 years. Construction, landscaping, welding, camping, framing, roofing... you name it, these boots perform. Best boots on the market.", "seems a good Boot and also superior in comfort and practicability to the previous Timberland Boot that I owned which having looked at a week ago after six years of solid service could be seen as a little the worse for wear and this one seemed an ideal replacement. Easy to put on and take off and if it last anything like the last one I will be well pleased.", "These boot outwork my 400$ redwings. No lie. I love these boots! I am an industrial electrician and they fit every safety need and the steel toe is comfortable.", "Sized works great - ordered one size bigger to accommodate for winter socks. Great shoe for a larger man", "I have had these boots for almost 6 years. By far my longest longevity boot I have ever owned. Brother also has a pair and uses them daily for work for the last year and half. His are holding up too, although he did have to buy some inserts. Very comfortable for steel toe boots. Would recommend them.", "I'll never buy a different boot. Timberland makes footwear for men.", "only had them on one time. I don't have them broke in yet", "My son works in a truck shop and is on his feet all day. The job is wet at times, and these keep his feet dry. He also really complained that his feet hurt with his previous weeks. These, he said, are very comfy. He\u2019s super happy with them!", "I like the fit and comfort of these rugged timberlands. Great price actually. Nice to know my feet are protected from people stepping on them lol for real with the steel toe feature is very convenient.", "My son found these boots very comfortable! He needs support. The metal toe was a plus for him. He has worn size 11 for years. This pair was snug. Hoping they will stretch.", "The only reason I didn't give these boots 5 stars is there was a small imperfection on the side of the sole. But it did not affect the functionality or water proofing on the boot.", "Best boots I have ever owned comfortable, light weight and durable just great.", "I bought these for my husband who is a logger...he loved them upon opening them..the third day he put them on the top eyelets where you wrap the lace around came right out...I was extremely disappointed with them seeing how we have worn timberlands since youth and this never happened before....my husband cannot now wear these boots...very disappointed", "Never tried these boots on and took a risk by ordering a pair through Amazon. They came and they're really comfortable. The rubber outsole started to SHRED after few hours of walking, doing errands trying to break them in. Within 3 weeks, the outsoles are down by 50%. I work in a warehouse environment, but at my desk 80% of the time. They're comfortable, but I don't see these lasting more than 3-4 months.", "Fits as expected and comfortable, especially compared to the boots I have been wearing to my factory job for the last year. I spend 10 hours a day on my feet and these do fine. As they start to wear I might get a set of gel inserts.", "Brand new and in perfect condition these boots fit like a glove. They\u2019re stylish and sharp to look at", "I\u2019m going to be completely blunt and brutally honest about these boots. If you\u2019re a hardworking man or woman looking for a pair of steel toe boots, than these are you\u2019re absolute GO-TO! Extremely comfortable fit, been walking on them for 9 hours this work day and not a single issue. Absolute great purchase and $94.00 is not bad at all, considering basketball shoes cost $150+ nowadays.", "The boots are rugged but there are ruff points inside the boots that make for some very painful spots! I have dealt with braking in boots before but nothing as severe as this pair.", "Good quality but no arch support but after inserting my personal arch support there my favorite boot now", "Unexpectedly comfortable! Normally the first few days with a new pair of boots on a logging job is misery, but these are very comfortable and appear to be well made. I would like to have a pair of these that were about two or three inches taller.", "I received these boots just days ago, put them on today to do some work around the house. Within an hour I felt something in my right boot. As well as the laces became very loose. Took them off to inspect what it was... turns out after wearing them for 1hr, both eyelets on the right boot broke off. For the price and \u201csupposed\u201d workmanship I am highly disappointed.", "You can find these excellent work boots just about anywhere but not for this price. Once a year I save myself and my company money.", "I bought the black boots here on amazon a few days ago... The black in the picture may look like some sort of leather, well.. it may be but it is coated with a rubber type material that makes these boots easy to care for. After trying some shoes here on amazon for my work I came to love these because they have the timberland PRO rubber, thus giving them Anti-Slip and Oil Resistance. If your in the service field and are looking for a anti-slip shoe that will last 5 + years still looking perfect... Then these are the shoes for you.", "I would store these in my car and the steel toe would be cold when I put them on. However, they did warm up quickly and I had no problem working out in the field. I do wish I did more research because I would probably get warmer boots if I had to do it again, however, I don't regret buying these.", "Boyfriend loved boots for 2 weeks until one of the metal hooks fell off yesterday. For a company as big as timberland I guess I expected more than 2 weeks without a problem. Since they are worn they are not returnable. Very disappointed in quality of product.", "These boots look great and have good features for the price. However, the heel cup just isn't right for me. I have to wear thicker than usual boot socks with these and the back of my foot still slides all over the place. Additionally, the left boot's insole is poorly fitted, won't stay in place, and irritates my foot quite a lot. I won't buy these again.", "All I can say about these boots is that, even after all this time, I've still got them, I'm still wearing them and they're still in great condition despite being put through hell. They're comfortable even after more than 12 hours. When I say \"literal hell\", I mean it. These boots have survived weld slag, various flavors of hot metallic chips thrown on / in them during milling and all kinds of weather conditions.", "My son is amazed at how comfortable these boots are all day at work! There is no rubbing on any part of his feet and his feet do not ache when removed.", "I dont buy shoes online but was hard to find boots my size (14) at local shops i had no choice but resort to amazon and luckily i chose Tims they are very comfortable.", "I like these very much. They seem to be about a half size too long. In all other ways they fit fine. I like the steel toe cap is wide like the width. Most boots seem to use one size ST cap for all widths. Not many or any with ST caps in this color, which is what I wanted but could not fine for months. I will buy another pair soon just have when I wear out this pair.", "This is my 2nd pair. I really like I really like how the boot fits and how he wears evenly. However, This pair the right foot inside where the elastic ends The leather portion where the eyelets are riveted on the upper part is rubbing my foot the wrong way so away so I have to add some padding on my ankle.", "I'd try some on in person first, I like a size bigger than my shoes. This is my second pair. They last quite a while and feel great for steel toe boots. Ill be sticking to timberlands in the future.", "I have been buying these same boots for more than 10 years. Always got them at Sears before but they no longer carry them. These boots always fit, however they run just a little bit wide. Most other boots I need to get the wide width, but the Pit Boss in the medium width fits me just right. They are comfortable right out of the box while still being supportive and sturdy enough to last me a full year before I need to get another pair. I am a truck mechanic and my work environment is very hard on shoes. I hope Timberland keeps making the Pit Boss because they definitely live up to their name.", "Very comfortable out of the box. Can't really tell they're steel toe. I've already put these through a beating and no signs of wear and coming apart.", "I ordere my size in 9.5 but they fit too short at the front. So i ordered a size bigger in 10 medium and they fit perfect. So i recommend ordering a size bigger. Tough boots, great for work, very confortable,", "Husband was completely happy with these boots. Very comfortable and he needed the steel toes as required by his employer. Thanks for the affordable price!", "This bad boys last for a lifetime. Also, the most comfortable shoe I\u2019ve ever worn, though they are quite heavy.", "My first pair of Timberland shoes and I am really impressed with the quality of this pair. Considering that this is a well known brand, you can expect such level of workmanship. I highly recommend this model...", "made over 200k in these boots an they are still in great shape definitely worth the money! Super comfortable", "These boots are extremely narrow. Bought size 13 wide and my feet won't fit. I have 13 regular dress shoes that are wider. Very disappointing. Will not consider this brand again.", "Wouldn't expect less than perfect from Timberland . Holds true with these boots.", "Boots stored in climate controlled closet, used maybe 5 times over the last 5 years, look brand new! Problem: the rubber soles are crumbling apart, complete and utter garbage sole material! Never had this happen on any other shoe I own, some are decades old.", "Really good product, used it for 8-9 months. Water ruined it. It is definitely not waterproof. They never advertise either, so it\u2019s ok.", "This is a garbage product. Made in China. Not the quality Timberland's of old. The uppers were fine. The soles delaminated and fell apart. They are glued together. Do not buy. A waste of money. Go with red wing or Carolina.", "Fits pretty good and wasn't too expensive for work boots. I just hope they last.", "product too narrow, not as expected. However, I was away from home for work, so I had to endure the blisters and pain on my left foot for a few days until I could use an alternate boot.", "Heavy, heavy, heavy...if you do a lot of long walking choose a lighter safety boot or shoe and if you have a big feet. Standing not so bad. If I get a chance to kick them off at work its a pleasure if I wear them all day bottoms of my feet are sore later. Insoles have little to no cushion. But the build quality is second to none. Its like wearing armor on your feet. Just a little heavy for an old guy like me.", "Great work boot. Initially I had some discomfort in both heels but after wearing them for a week they fit and felt great. Soles grip well.", "The boots fir well, comfterble, but no where near water proof steeped in a puddle at work and my sock was socked and so was the sole of my boots. All in all good steel toe book for the price much better then what you get at walmart.", "I wore these recently on a deployment with Team Rubicon. They fit well and I didn\u2019t have any issues even in wet conditions.", "Excellent boot for the steep hillsides and gardening chores I needed them for.", "Horrible soles less than 8 months soles are done for legs and feet ache after wearing them.", "They run small and fit very tight in the toe area", "It's a good durable boot, sole has held up find through rain and mud and I'm eager to see how it does in snow. However, walking ten-twenty city blocks with these on is a good way to get bad cramps. I'd imagine these would be good on a job site or a nature trail, but are not comfortable on flat ground for long distances. Still a good boot.", "On paper, these boots were exactly what I wanted and I've had really good luck with Timberland PRO boots (I'm on my 4th pair now), but the Pitboss boots have a seam that rubbed on the outside of my ankles and made them unwearable.", "They are decent boots. I found it difficult to remove the scratches but they are work boots so I'm not too concerned with it. Not great for winter if your feet get cold quickly. No complaints with slipping, I will probably get another pair when these wear out.", "Last pair I got from somewhere else exploded on my feet, so far these haven\u2019t", "Bought these for my son for Christmas for work and he absolutely loves them.", "Paid for a pair of new boots, got sent a pair with scuff marks. Someone very obviously tried these on, kicked a couple things to test the steel toe, and returned them. The boots themselves are great, fit great and feel good, but I hate paying for a new product and getting something already used and returned with marks and scuffs on it.", "I really like the timberland pro boondocks. Bought these as a cheaper alternative and I returned them. No cusion what so ever. You get what you pay for", "Extremely comfortable boots with very little break in required. I did purchase the separate Timberland anti fatigue insoles which I would recommend.", "Why do I keep buying timberland product knowing that they aren\u2019t good quality?! One of the shoe lace grommets broke off after a week of use.", "The wides aren't quite as wide as I'd hoped, but they fit well enough. Good comfortable waterproof boot with protective toe.", "Like the boots, comfortable and seem to be well made. Have to use them for awhile under working conditions!", "Mechanic work on feet all day. Shoes did the job. Dud have to replace in a year", "Job brought me my 1st 2 pairs and I love em. Steel toe plus sole. If taking many hits with these and gave never felt any. I use these for industrial work and for riding my motorcycle. Great buy for the working man.", "I LOVE THESE BOOTS! I have always had a pair of Timberland boots ever since my first pair in 7th grade and this is my first pair with a steel toe. The quality is great and they feel really sturdy. I am by no means a professional but whether it's standing at my reloading bench for hours or building houses with Habitat for Humanity or just walking my dog on the beach, these boots are awesome. Took me about 2 weeks (give or take) to break them in. I would highly recommend these boots to everyone!", "Very comfortable, short break in period. Looking for a good workbook. Not sure anyone is making such a product these days. Very disappointed with trying 2 styles of Wolverine boots, good customer service but very poor quality boots. Just waiting to see how these work out.", "Great boot for the price, been using this style for many years. Holds up to the demands of my job working in and out of garages and office buildings. Switched to steel toe hoping they would be close to the none steel, can\u2019t tell a big difference. Plan on buying another pair in the near future to have a backup.", "They are knock offs don\u2019t fall for it. They don\u2019t look like the pictures. When I got mine they looked like snow boots , they seem cheap and bulky.", "Decent fitting work boots. Medium comfort. Soles are kind of slippery. Not a lot of wiggle room in the toe box but these likely just need to be broken in with a few wears to fix those issues. This review is too early to give a full report but nothing much to complain about. Needs more cushion inside but I like them.", "Have had several pairs of these over the years and they are great quality and last.", "Good boot, the toe was a little stiff at first, but it\u2019s starting to loosen up.", "Very nice looking good quality boot. Unfortunately my brothers foot was too wide and the steel toe was not wide enough for him. I had to return the boots even though I had ordered wide width and half size bigger.", "too small 2 for 2, order them half a size larger than you think you should.", "Very pleased with this purchase. The price was very reasonable for what I was looking to pay. Overall, the boot took a little longer than expected to \"break in\" but I attributed that to the quality of leather used. The boot seems a little heaven, prolly due to the steel toe insert, but your foot gets used to it quick. I live in Ohio, were the weather is very inconsistent, so I have yet to wear these in extremely cold conditions but the boots seem to be warm. Very comfortable. Very satisfied.", "NICE, HIGH QUALITY BOOTS. NEXT TIME ILL GET THE ONES THAT HAVE HOLES FOR THE LACES ALL THE WAY UP INSTEAD OF THE HOOKS. THE HOOKS SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE FASTER BUT THEY ARE SMALL AND THE LACES TEND TO KEEP COMING OUT OF THE HOOKS WHILE TRYING TO GET THEM TIED. SO FAR AFTER ONE WEEK THEY SEEM COMFORTABLE AND WELL CONSTRUCTED.", "This is a nice boot. better than most steel toe boots I have warn in the last 10 years. I will buy again.", "Great boots. I use them for when im working with soil outside. Really comfortable solid boots! Reminds me of the old ones I use to have.", "My husband is a landscaper. He works 10+ hours a day on his feet doing heavy duty work. Timberland is known for their quality and this is no exception. My husband has dropped flagstone, large rocks, lumber and so many other things on his feet and thank goodness for the steel toe in the shoes, it has saved his feet. He says you need to break it in a little. I highly recommend these shoes. We will buy another pair once these wear out.", "They fit very tight. I probably should have gone 1 size up. I work in a large manufacturing plant and walk quite a bit. My feet were killing me at the end of the night. I am hopeful that I will only need a few days to break these in.", "Use for work everyday. Everything advertised about these boots was true", "Couldn't find a good pair of Timberland pros this time around, seems like they are getting cheeper. I went with Ariat.", "just a bit heavy at first ..I wear everyday and hold up strong", "After getting the S*&^t smacked out of my foot by a chuck left in a lathe (which was dumb), I decided to buy some steal toed boots and these are good ones. they're pretty comfortable for what they are. a bit heavy for sure but overall not terrible to wear. You do feel very protected when wearing them though and they're easy to wash off and stay relatively clean. They fit well i was worried but they fit just as they should.", "Arrived without a boot lace hook on the left boot. Already exchanged them for credit and bought some CAT Steel toed shoes from a local vendor. Really didn't feel like playing a back and forth game with my new job's start date being in a few days.", "The left boot fits nice, however the right boot is too tight on my toes. Leaving me unable to wear these boots 5 times a week as the pain becomes too much. They\u2019re nice and durable just too tight on the right foot. Have never had this problem with shoes before!", "He is in love with these boots. Swears it's one of the most comfortable shoes ever. This is his second pair. He had brown ones first but riding the motorcycle really wore out the leather on the toes, so even though he still wears them, he wanted a pair that looks not so beat up when we go out somewhere. But he STILL wears the same brown ones he's had for years. The fit is right on too. Very well made and worth the money for sure!", "Love these boots! Very comfortable for a steel toe boots... will definitely buy again in the future.", "Take time to break the boot in properly. The leather is thick and tough so do not use it right away for work. Once its broken in properly she's good to go. Plenty of room to do the 2 sock method.", "In my opinion, these are the best work boots ever made. Excellent quality and workmanship. Nice wide steel toe box so my toes aren't smashed together. Very comfy insole and foot bed. They have great traction too. Nice and sticky, not some hard plastic tread. Now all I have to do is get them broke in and they will be awesome. Fast delivery and just what I ordered. Thank you Timberland for designing this great boot. Please, never discontinue this boot. I'm a lifetime user of the Pitboss Pro.", "Falling apart in just a couple months not happy with these boots.", "Great durability! I work in a rockyard that sends tennis shoes to the grave in a month, regular boots in 3 or 4, best is 6. This pair has lasted me just under 3 years. Already reordered to replace. FyI only downside so far was the 'black' color dyed on the inside bleed onto my socks with sweat. Don't know if thats been fixed in these last 3 years though.", "I had to make a minor alteration to the inner sole that is former of molded material. I am still so impressed by these boots I would recommend them to my best friend.", "Excellent boots, out of the box with no socks, they weren't that comfy. I put socks on and they felt much better. I also put in a pair of dr schoals massaging gels and now they're outstanding. I'm a diesel mechanic working on hard concrete 8hrs a day. I like timberland boots because they are durable, comfortable and don't slip like other boots. The last 3 pair of Timberlands I've owned are still in good condition.", "Great fit and they are durable. I spend 10-12 hours per day on my feet at construction sites and these have been the best that I've found for me.", "I ordered this boot 1/2 size larger than I usually wear because the last work boots I bought were too tight and there's nothing worse than tight fitting boots. I noticed that the front of the boots feel a bit stiff when I bend my foot walking forward, but I think it's because they're new and just need to be worn in and I probably also need to adjust the tension on the laces. I also bought a can of the Atsko SNO-SEAL Beeswax Waterproofing and applied that to the boots so now they're ready for Seattle weather!", "they run wide, but i have kinda narrow feet, so i have to cinch them up tight. they are the best work boots i've found yet though. this is my third pair, and they usually last a year. on average 4 miles a day in them.", "Leather got scratched easy but is still holding up. Overall durable.", "A very nice pair of boots. So far very comfortable and easy on the feet and legs.", "Amazing working boots, fit perfectly amd are comfy. They also have great grip, in my opinion top it with some soles and you'll be comfortable during working time.", "Probably the most comfortable boots I\u2019ve had yet. Used them for 2 yrs on concrete. I did put the Timberland insoles in them, as they definitely got rid of knee pain I had accrued over the years", "Awesome boot, wish I had bought these years ago. Update: after 12 hours of hard work these things are even better. Go buy these boots. Amazon prime and their affiliates ROCK. Will be buying another pair for going out and being casual.", "We had initially ordered my son's normal size, but they were a bit tight when combined with the better work socks that we had gotten, so we sent the first pair of boots back to the shipper, and received a new pair almost immediately. They now fit perfectly and comfortably. This is a great boot! My son loves them!", "It was tight fit at first, then it settled in after few days. After about6 weeks of use, the shoelace metal loop broke off. Disappointed. I dont recommend it. Dont buy it. . My last pair was a carhartt and it lasted about a year.", "I wear these every day at work for at least 8 hours a day. I think they are a really nice pair of boots. They look really good, and seem to be holding up to day to day abuse. I bought some insoles for them, but I just think that all work boots need insoles, not necessarily a flaw of these particular boots. I also bought some leather lotion, moisturizing protectant type stuff. I would recommend it, it keeps them looking newer longer.", "I order a half size too big which is not anyone but my own fault but the rivet for the lace eyelet snapped right off trying to lace up at boots and there weren't that many eyelet to use. I eventually returned them and probably will stick with red wing boots", "This is my second time around in these boots! Quickly becoming my favorite work boot. Durable, comfortable and affordable! Probably going for the third round next year!!", "Tims are great. Quality and durability are high. This is not my favorite Tim, but it's good for the price.", "I ordered them for my husband and he loves them! They are very comfortable and last long! Will definitely order again!", "Great fit in a solid boot, just one major problem for me: Sewn inside the light inner lining floats a plastic heal insert that cuts right into my ankle bone. With no need for any further pain and suffering in the workplace they were promptly returned.", "Arrived on time and the size runs as expected. They are heavy, but understandably as they have a steel toe... a little stiff so i will need to break them in a bit. Overall happy with boots.", "Purchased these for my husband after he read several reviews stating these boots were extremely comfortable. He is on his feet several hours a day and requires comfortable, well fitting boots. He wore the boots one day and refused to continue to use them. Both boots have a hard \"ridge\" around the inside/heel area that seemed to be a hard \"plastic\" material. The ridge was pressing against the back of his heel area and created a sensitive, blistered area. Thanks to Amazon for their ZERO hassle return policy. Boots have been returned for a full refund. . . . the search continues for a comfortable boot.", "The boots are well made but the sizing is off a bit. This is my second pair of the same boot from the same manufacturer and the same size but.... they aren't the same size. They are noticeably different.", "They are the heaviest and most uncomfortable boots I have ever owned!", "Picked up a pair after moving to the mountains so I could chop firewood with the piece of mind of knowing I wouldn't accidentally chop off a toe! I now find myself reaching for them anytime I need to do a little work outside and even wore them on a 3 mile hike last week. Love them.", "Great boots. I love the Timberland Pro brand and I own two pairs but these are just not as comfortable as the Boondock model. These can even pass for dressy (for my standards), just put a little shine on them.", "My boyfriend wears them for work. He really likes them but the one button thing came off after 2 days so not sure how long they will last", "Bought one pair and the steel toe on the right foot dug into my pinky toe. Returned and replaced and the second pair had the same problem but on the left foot. Size 12w always fits me fine, but these shoes are at least a size too small and the wide size doesn\u2019t seem to change the steel insert", "Fit is just right. Can\u2019t beat the price! Better than shopping in the store. No arch support though. I\u2019d recommend an insole for that. But other than that it\u2019s a great shoe! Love em.", "I purchased these about a year ago. They are very comfortable, especially for being steel-toed, and very solid boots. The soles and stitching are all holding up well after a year. Some of the leather is getting chewed up a bit, but that is to be expected after a year of pretty good use. I expect they will last at least another year or more, and I plan to replace them with the same boots.", "Should of ordered a half size bigger but other than that these are comfy and you feel secure no matter the surface", "I love the way it fits. Well built boots. Best boots that I have bought.", "I have inserted insoles from a third party supplier that have made the boots fit and wear very well. Cannot believe that Timberland would resort to such a limited quality insert and could make this item a top of class boot if they spent a little more on arch and sole. Otherwise the boot will serve as a great work boot.", "The most comfortable boots I have owned. They fit perfectly and form well to the foot. They have shown their durability the last three months in a factory setting and are surprisingly cool for full size steel toe boots.", "This is my husband's second pair in FIFTEEN years. He's a driver and he's on his feet 5 days a week; some driving some warehouse work. He JUST started getting a hole fifteen years later so he finally decided to order a second pair. He didn't want anything else as these have held up so well. SO worth the money. In the fifteen years, he has definitely gotten his money's worth 100 x's over. There is a reason why paying a little bit more is better = quality. Will be buying over and over and over. A++++++++++++++++", "I bought these for work (Concrete) a year ago and still have them. Usually boots only last me a year with the work I do, but this might last me 2, as long as I keep it oiled. The tread is barely worn down, and the leather seems high quality. I never had a blister or and achy back from these boots!", "Was much happier with these in the first pair actually wearing them right now", "The boot seems very durable and nicely manufactured. My husband has chosen Timberlands as his favorite work boots bc of the quality. We were sad that these didn't fit properly. He's always worn a 12 in their brand but these didn't fit like any of his previous pairs.", "Good boot but not for all day wear at work. For hanging out they are fine styling they are fine , work not that great they have hard bottoms it's best u buy extra comfort for the boot. But still good boot.", "These Shoes are among the best I have worn ,they fit very well and are very comfortable to walk in .Several other brands I have worn are very slippery on slightly wet surfaces . These shoes have not been slippery at all . The pattern is different and large enough that small rocks and debris do not stick like some of my other shoes . I recommend these shoes to anyone who wants comfortable waterproof shoes for walking or just everyday wear .", "This is the first time ordering timberlands off amazon and NEVER AGAIN! This is after not even 2 months! They are literally falling apart!", "These actually are the best boots I think you buy. Probably will last me a year which is really good considering my work. Will by another pair.", "The worst pair of work boots I have ever bought before. I will never buy this brand again. They are too uncomfortable to wear and caused blisters on my heel on the first day.", "To me these boots were comfy at first. They took a crazy whooping but they're giving out after about 3 months of use. Given I beat my boots like a cherokee drum... overall feel like I got my monies worth out of them.", "This boot looks like it\u2019s built well , but the initial fit was tight. They\u2019re loosening up and the fit seems to be getting better", "These work boots did not even last two weeks on the job site. The material on the toe of the boot is completely worn off, and the steel is showing through on both boots. I expected much more from work boots, and much more from Timberland. I will not buy these boots again. Frankly, for $100, and after less than two weeks of use, I want my money back from this purchase.", "I wore these boots to my job expecting the typical timberland reliability and comfort. The construction is durable and they are very well made. However, these boots killed my feet!! The inner liner on my heeled rubbed my left foot raw to the point of blistering it badly and the right boot cuff bruised my ankle. I could barely walk in these boots after my work day had ended. I am very disappointed in this purchase, and would get my money back if possible. I'm still a fan of timberland apparel unfortunately these aren't what I hoped they'd be after reading all of the favorable reviews.", "The most uncomfortable boot I've ever put on. I hope that insoles will help. There is a hard piece of plastic from the heel until midsole that digs in the side of your foot.", "ive had these boots 3 times over the last 7 or 8 years. they fit pretty well and hold up. i wear em in a bus paintshop so they get wet, coated in dust and occasionally get solvents on them and still last", "My husbands favorite work boots. They last him almost a year! Anyone who has to buy work boots for men who go through work boots knows... A year is a long time. He says these are the most comfortable he has ever owned. I am sure he expects another pair for Fathers day soon.", "I have used timberland pros for work for years. This pair lasted six months and both heels separated. Also has an uncomfortable seam or edge that digs into back of left ankle.

Comfortable and sturdy.", "This is my 3rd pair in last 5 years and I have never had an issue with those shoes. One of the best work shoes I have used in years and very comfortable. The steel toe doesn't feel so heavy as it does with some other shoes that I have both from other brands.", "Overall very good, no heel seam issues that other reviewers have mentioned. Slightly snug in width, otherwise comfortable - so far so good.", "Other reviews said comfortable right out of the box. They weren\u2019t lying.

Is the second one I purchase.", "This is the second pair that I have purchased. I have been wearing the first pair daily for close the three years and in a heavy duty construction environment and they are still in great shape. I bought the second pair so I can break them in before the first pair wear out totally. These are great boots and a good price,", "Little heavy. Very good traction. Nice color. Fits good. I ordered the wide version. Unfortunately one of the boots has a little assembly defect. I noticed it digging into my ankle so I inspected it. See picture.", "I purchased these boots for my son because his new job required steel-toe boots. I read the reviews before I ordered them and they were the deciding factor. At that time there were over 800 customer reviews and more than 500 of them gave the boots 5 stars so I felt good about ordering them. Good move on my part! My son loved the boots. His exact words were, \"Mom, the boots you got me are awesome! I love them.\" So I am adding my 5 star rating to the rest and will be ordering these boots again. Guaranteed!", "I wear a 13 boot with thick socks. This boot had some wiggle room in it as a 13 with thick socks on. I could have easily gone a size smaller.", "These are absolutely true to size and are quality boots and look amazing!", "I love these boots. I tried them on in a department store first and found I had to order a whole size smaller, but I love em. The insole was the most comfortable I have ever experienced, but that only lasted about a month. Now they're just comfortable shoes that look great.", "can't go wrong with timberland. Fits comfortably. Great toe protection. it'll last me 3 years, which is unusual since the amount of work and abuse I'll put these boots.", "Have had these shoes before. So I knew how they were going to fit or hoped they would fit. I am retired so I wanted a comfortable shoe to wear when I am working in the yard. These shoes fit the bill.", "I Have owned these boots for 4 years and they are great. I go to construction sites 3 or 4x a week and these boots have held up extremely well and they are comfortable to be in all day. Very pleased and will definitely order again.", "These shoes were perfect in every possible way. I\u2019d buy again", "I wear them all day and after dinner go into my small shop and continue to work. The key for me? I don't even think about them - they are that comfortable!", "Purchased these because of such great reviews and have been sadly disappointed. The plastic sole on the inside of the boot is exposed and therefore it\u2019s like your walking on hard plastic mall day. It bruised my heels and I had to stop wearing them. Going back to my CAT Flex Fit boots until I can find a better pair", "I'm not a fan of the height on these shoes. I had some that hit a little higher on the leg and definitely prefered that. This just ends not too high above the ankle and it feels weird. I usually break boots in but was unable to do that with these... and paid for it. I've worn steel- toed boots before with no issues but I got quarter sized blisters on my heels the first week with these. So I alternated wearing these with my K-Swiss Women's Tubes Run 100 Running Shoes. Now that I've had them about a month, they are not causing any blistering and fit decently, but the height of the shoe is still weird to me.", "Excellent pair of boots, just the right fit for me, a bit heavy on the legs, but excellent overall. I\u2019ll buy me another set to have when this one wear down.", "Really good shoes if working in labs or testing facilities. Not sure about their strength when welding or working in machine shops. They do get dirty real fast but easy to clean after a week if not dirty with liquids.", "I have worn these boots everyday for about 2 months. Takes some time to get use to because they are a lot better built that my $20 walmart boots. If you drive a manual or a smaller car, you may want to practice before driving in these. I find my self looking down every now and then to check and see if my feet are really on the pedals, because you cant feel anything outside these boots. Very high quality, as comfortable as working boots get, and they are worth every penny.", "After researching what are the best work boots for men these were up at the very top.

The price was the best part and the fact there is no sore feet at the end of the day", "Great work boot, needs some time to break in in order to be comfortable.", "I purchase these boots for my son who works in the construction industry. He says they are so comfortable for all day wear. I purchase him a new pair every year to year and a half, for his birthday or Christmas, only because they start looking worn. He keeps the older pair and wears them when working around the house and mowing the grass. He loves these boots.", "Great product.

In the beginning these boots were very hard to break in. My back was hurting me and I thought about attempting to return them. I gave it a little bit more time and changed out the inserts and now these are my favorite go to boots. Granted I am using a different insert to prevent lower back pain but to rate the physical boot, I love it.", "Comfortable with insoles but that was expected I have had these boots in the past.

Tried 3 different sizes. Narrow toe box.

Very happy", "With light wear it barely lasted a year, I could only imagine how long it would last in a rough environment.", "Bought this items for my husband for work and it fits him perfect. Very happy with the purchase I made. The only thing they could do better is with the packaging!! The packaging was left in front of my front door halfway opened, any one could see what I bought and steel my item that I bought.", "my son ordered these for himself (thank God). he is very pleased with them for various reasons. one they are kinda stylish to be a work boot. and they provide very good protection for his feet. in his line of work and with the surfaces that he walks on, he does not complain about foot pain either. over all a very good constructed boot and you definitely will get your bang for your buck outta these.", "Well, for my purposes they are great; they feel and fit well. Just what I wanted as far as comfort and work safety at the same time. They are sturdy! Also, I like the way they are finished inside and out. They are not waterproof, then again I didn't ask for it. I did spray them with a water repellent. I guess shoes are Catch 22; sometimes they are OK and the other times they are not.", "I says overall the shoes are in great condition. My husband works 12 hr shifts and stands all night. He had no complaints about the boots and stated they are more comfortable than some other steel toe boots without us needing to pay 200+ for more comfortable shoes. We had to rrturn order and re-order twice before my husband got the size that worked for him. Which was a little inconvenience and annoying but once we got the size everything else was solid", "I do renovations and repairs. Consequently I do everything from framing, plumbing, electrical, tiling, etc. I need a comfortable all day boot that protects my feet with good toe cavity when tiling. I like the angled heel and easy lace up. This is my second pair. The first ones lasted 3 years before showing wear. The sole (and grip) are excellent for ladder work and traction on slippery surfaces.", "I purchased these boots because I needed steel shoes for my job (occasionnaly). I just wor it few times and the crampons are already tearing (worn only on the carpet and concrete). Plus it hurts my hell and ankle after few minutes walking. These boots were the most expensive I have had but also the most uncomfortable and less robust. Fortunately I have not worked hard in the fields yet.", "These boots aren't quite as heavy as I expected, but when I dropped a boulder on my foot, they protected my foot perfectly. They're comfortable (I've been known to wear them for 16 or more hours at a time), and durable (I wear them at least 12 hours a day every day, and I've had them half a year now with little sign of wear).", "My fiance works outdoors and these lasted for awhile but got uncomfortable.

He says they are very comfy.", "I've been buying these boots for about 12 years now.

Bought like 3 months ago", "I love Timberland Pro boots, but these are the least comfortable boots I have ever worn. I sent them back. This is the first time I have ever returned something to amazon. Will I try another Timberlin Boot? Absoulutely... I have several comfortable pairs. Unfortunately, they don't last forever. I wear them so much, I need to replace them every year. Believe it or not, most of the timberland Pro boots I have, are more comfortable than sneakers.", "I bought these for my boyfriend to work in at a diesel shop. He likes them. They came as described and pictured. Would repurchase.", "The boot is tough as nails. I work in a chemical plant and it holds up perfect.

Fit great, very comfortable. Now in mid April. I have worn holes in the insoles right at the balls of my feet in both shoes. I run a landscaping business so they get worn daily and are worked hard but after 3 months there shot. I previously wore Keen utility and they would last 9 months to a year but break in was difficult.", "These boots hold up pretty well, are comfortable, and look great. I got the wide versions, however they feel a little narrow. Also the steel toes digs into my foot once in a while.", "I wore the heck out of these boots, they lasted me about 2 years.

I\u2019ve owned several Timberland items and all have done me justice.", "2nd pair my husband has bought first pair lasted a year and half, he can still wear they are just beat up.

Under 100 Not bad.", "I ordered a 9.5r pair at first they fit alright except in the toe area, so then i got a pair of wides, they were the exact same boot just had a wide label on it.

But you dont care.", "Had a different pair of timberlands that were terrible and gave me nasty blisters on my heels. I\u2019ve had these before and loved them. For some reason I felt like changing it up but that was a big mistake. I\u2019m now on my 3rd pair of these boots and I\u2019ll never buy a different pair again. Absolutely love them. Personally, these are the most comfortable boots I\u2019ve ever worn even before they\u2019re broken in. Highly recommend.", "Toe box is tight not waterproof had for less than two week and about wore out inside and rusted. Not for working on concrete floor 7 days a week.", "My second pair, first pair performed excellently. These are perfect for me. As a finish carpenter I need comfort and durability. They meet the challenge.", "These boots are excellent work boots. They provide excellent support and protection. My feet don't get too hot or tired in these. They are easy to lace up and the remove able insole can be washed. The steel toe adds a little weight but it gives real protection. I recommend them for anything but very cold weather as they are not super insulated. Protect them with silicone or mink oil and they last about three years .", "I have had multiple pairs of these boots and keep coming back to them. Really enjoy how they break in and last over time.", "Fits and feels great, im glad i ordered a 1/2 size larger, for some reason steel toe boots fit better slightly oversized", "These are really warm and watertight in nasty weather. I hate having wet feet and the only way you get that with these is if you're sweating like crazy. I'm a mechanic and I put them through a lot of abuse which they have held up to well.

Not the warmest for wisconsin right now, but it's not a winter boot so as long as they last I'll be happy", "Steel toe size must be a half size larger than normal.

Been wearing timberlands for 8+ years. Comfortable. Strong. The only thing I think they can change is to make the laces stronger.", "Depending on the condition of your feet, it may be tight. Nevertheless, I think it is a very good product. I've been using it for over a year and I'm satisfied. Just in the hot summer, I feel nervous. It's easy to buy something cool for the summer.", "Just got my boots had them for a week feel comfortable .they look durable will give more feed back once I get a few months in fit true to size will recommend the wide versions cause I got the wide versions and they still feel. A little narrow but not that much on them", "These boots worked very well for a long time. I've had them for just shy of 2 years and they are definitely ready to retire.

I now buy only size 13 wide width so I can get this extra padding in. The extra padding/insoles fit perfect without trimming and zero binding in the 13w boot.

I wore them for fashion for awhile but then I started wearing them for work and they're scratched and stuff but the leather isn't even close to wearing down.

Easily broken in from what I can tell, the boot loops feel sturdy and the laces aren't the cheap ones that will tear after being looped through a few times. Very happy thus far!", "Durable. I usually get 2 years of heavy construction use from these.", "So far so good. A little stiff and uncomfortable at first, but they seem to be breaking in nicely and are already much more comfortable after a couple days of use. Hopefully they last. I have had problems finding a reasonably priced pair of work boots that last with daily use and an occasional oiling. They appear of a good quality.", "We bought these boots for my husband as he is a commercial hvac technician and the sole had come off of his other boots that we bought from Walmart. He absolutely loves these boots. He says that they fit great and are sooo comfortable. All that I can say is that you get what you pay for and these we worth every penny.", "Excellent work boot, very comfortable to wear for long periods. This is my second pair, very satisfied.", "Awesome! I walk 5- 20 miles a day in these. My feet aren't tired at all. Highly recommended", "I have owned several pairs of these boots over many years. They are always comfortable and durable.", "Probably the worst work boots I've ever purchased. They began falling apart after only three months light use. I will NEVER BUY these shoes or ANY TIMBERLAND BOOTS EVER AGAIN.", "I have been use to buying only what I have thought for 30 plus years was the best brand there is. I thought I would try these and glad I did. I have used a size 8.5 D in all boots in the past and these fit the same. They seem to be made pretty strong and over all I like them and think they will hold up well enough in lawn & landscaping. I have only had these a few days now.", "Had a defective steel toe that was partially collapsed, but since these were my spare boots i didn\u2019t notice until it was too late to return them. They just need to work on quality control... otherwise they would have been very nice boots.", "These boots arrived on time, paid less than $95 for them, the last pair I owned lasted about a year which is about normal for me. I'm on my feet 8-11 hrs a day which includes hot, cold, warm and dry conditions..I highly recommend these boots or any timberland work boot..the name speaks for itself.", "This is my second pair. First pair lasted me over two and half years (wearing them 50-60 hours a week - standing all day). DO NOT order the OTHER Timberland steel toes. They are small and narrow. I wear between an 11-12 mens. I ordered an 11 in these and they fit perfectly!", "This boot is tough as nails. Unfortunately it's pretty tough on your foot too. Even after a few weeks to break them in, it still causes foot fatigue. I can barely work a full 8 hour day in these boots. working over time literally causes pain. I need a foot rub every day from my wife.", "This is my husbands 4th pair of these boots and the soles have split in less than 6 months of use on the most recent pair. Usually he gets a new pair every1 1/2 years due to normal wear and tear, but it seems quality is declining in the product, unfortunate, wont be buying again", "Iv'e bought the same size Timberland boots for the past 8 years. Love them. But this pair I could barely get my foot in the boot. I normally wear a 8 and 8.5 M in Timberland boots. Very unhappy. was going to exchange but the reviews are all bad now, maybe the quality department went on break. Sux, I really did like all my other Timberlands.", "These boots are a grate value and last a very long time. Great for anyone who has to stand all day. For me this was a no brainer. My husband loves these boots, and normally we go pick them up at a local store. But thanks to Amazon and my prime account I get the same thing for less money and without the hassle of driving through weekend traffic.", "My husband likes these boots. He says they are comfortable and functional. The lace hooks are somewhat shallow so the laces can slip off during the tying process but hold good once tied. The laces loosen after walking around unless they are double knotted.", "The boot was clean. however it looks like a default in the making, I will like to return these boots because the steel toe is bulging on the sides on both pairs and that is not common, the shoes looks weird. I have had these shoes before and I will like one that looks better than this. But I can't find how to return this item.", "I served in the military and was required to wear steel toe boots for years. I went through nearly a dozen pair during my time in and so I am picky when it comes getting the right fit because I know how these things will \"beak-in\". The cup on these was too narrow in the D fit and that is not something you can change. The rest of the boot was extremely comfortable but the cup is the reason you are buying steel-toe.", "Most comfortable boot I've ever purchased. I work in a harsh environment around HCL, Phos Acid, and Caustic. This is my second pair, and the first easily lasted for just over two years. I've had the soles fall off Chippewas, and I've had Red Wings fall apart before I could even break them in. This boot is cheaper than the competition, wayyyyyyyyyy more comfortable with very little break in, and they last. Two years from now I'll come right back here and hit the reorder button.", "I love the fact that everything fit as expected and were here right on time! I couldn't open the box fast enough and wear them for work daily!", "You get exactly what it looks like you\u2019re buying. Quality work boots. Good fit. Fairly comfortable.

It lasts a long time and is very durable.", "I use these boots for cycling. Good protection when riding.", "One of the best investments I ever made when it came to footwear. Saved my toes when a forklift ran over my foot with only minor discomfort and no damage to the actual shoe. Fits well and is moderately comfortable. Would highly recommend \ud83d\udc4c", "It's an all around good boot! It fits great and feels nice! I've waited to write this review because it has been 2 months and the leather on the toe scars somewhat quickly, and the soles wear out somewhat quickly, I do work a lot of overtime every week. In an industrial setting this wont last, in a 40 hour factory job they would do pretty well.", "These boots feel lighter walking in them than they are. Haven't tried working in them yet but so far I think they'll do just fine.", "Really like boot leather ripped on toe about 4 months but other then that great boot", "These fit me really well. I like the quick lacing at the top of the shoe too. Saves a lot of time from putting on and taking off the shoes", "I've had these boots for 3 years. Did alot of traveling in them. Alot of restoration work. Miles of walking, demo and general use. The quality has held up, no stitching undone, nothing has fallen apart or off. On thing would be when the insolea have been worn down, buy some new gel inserts. My pair has been used and abused and are still solid and reliable. Haven't had to buy another pair of work boots yet.", "Rigid reinforced soles are awesome on the ladder and throughout the job site steel toes are cushioned on the top inside which add to the all day comfort. Will recommend to coworkers and others when looking for a quality pair of boots!", "My 16 year old son is hard to please to say the least. I knew I needed to buy boots for him and was not to happy about it because he is so picky. When I found these, I thought they would be great and the price was really good. He liked the picture so he asked me to go ahead and order them. When he came home he opened the box and smiled (this is a moody teenager we're talking about). He wore them the same day even though it was 60 degrees outside! So pleased with this purchase!", "Great boots but too small, if you want them you better ask for the W, I had to return mine because of that, I never bought a wide boot before because my feet are very thinner, but not this case!!!", "This is my husband's second pair. He has very wide feet and finding comfortable boots is rare. They hold up well too.", "usually wear 12 1/2 in shoes so I bought 12 1/2 wide they didn't fit so I went a 13 narrow fit pretty good a little big but cant complain my feet feel good in these boots work a 12 hour day feet don't hurt at all very comfortable Best boot to buy for 100 bucks you wont find a better boot for that price highly recommend buying these boots.", "I got these shoes cause i was buying boots from wal-mart and those boots ususally lasted about 3 to 6 months. I've had these about 3 months now and they look like brand new. Almost no sign of wear on the outer sole. They broke in very fast and so far they are great boots. I did however notice that i wore a hole in the inside sole by my big toe. As far as I'm concerned these are the best boots I have ever had.", "My only pair of work boots now, I wear these in negative degree weather and even got humid miami temperatures and they are still good as new quality. Many cuts and scraps and wear on the outside but the comfort and the fit Is still superb. We're a little big but I put some thick insoles to improve comfort and fit. pro series is the way to go, my coworker all want a pair now :)", "No arch support makes these shoes painful for flat feet after a couple hours - adding support underneath makes it perfect; it accommodates my wide feet fine (i have 2E). Timberland reps have said that their shoes tend to run large, so general consensus is to go half a size down (e.g. get size 10 for a person who's usually size 10.5), but that's just my $0.02.", "A five star on comfort and style. Really stands up to its name. Excellent safety toe shoes and very durable. 2 yrs plus and still going strong.", "My first order of these timberland I ask for them in brown. I send those back, defect. Amazon send me a new pair of the same timberland in black.", "I work in sanitation so the atmosphere isn't all too pleasant. The 1st day of work made my shoes look as if I had them for months but the durability and comfortability is unparalleled. I place insoles for additional comfort. No complaints here!", "Did not even get the right shoe tied ( for the first time) and a lace stud popped out and went flying across the room. Going to keep them anyway and take them to a cobbler and replace the studs for eyes. I don't care too much for going through the hassle of returning. Won't order shoes online anymore even though it could be a fluke.", "Very uncomfortable around the ankle and toe box, product was returned. The return process was very expedient and easy considering. This is the forst time we have ever had any problems with the Pro Series.", "Break in period is about a week and a half. These boots left many blisters on the back of my heel due to a seam. Once broken in they are quite comfortable. Unfortunately after only wearing them for about a month and a half the leather on the toe is gone so my steel is showing.

These are wrapped and ready for Christmas.", "Been shopping for a pair of sturdy work boots for a few weeks, and after shopping around the local stores, was about to accept that I'd be slapping down over $130 for a pair. Luckily I thought of Amazon before hand, and thank god. These boots are perfect. They're not pretty, but they're not supposed to be. They're comfortable, they break in quickly, and they keep your feet safe.", "My son says they are comfortable and warm. He works outside all day in the Illinois winters. They are replacing a pair of the same boot which held up well so are anticipating the same quality with this pair.", "Not very comfortable. I read alot of comments complaining about the seam on the the back of the heel and that really is the biggest problem. It gets a little better once you get them broken in. Not a terrible boot for the price but next time I will probably invest more into a better boot.", "Ive ordered these several times for my husband and he loves them", "Same model and size as the last pair I destroyed after 3 years of hard use.

We ususally buy them at Sears but I found they were on Amazon so I ordered them. He did not wear them until March 24 2014. In the first week there is a big gash at bottom of boot were material meets the sole. It is to late to return them so he is just wearing them till they completely fall apart. Probly wont order again from Amazon.", "Great shoes honesty - they look great and fit well! As expected you need to buy better insoles for them because steel toe boots never come with good insoles. Only complainant is a little piece of plastic that will kill your ankle the first week of wearing them", "hands down best boot I have ever owned, survived longer and performed better 3 years and 2 pairs strong (60+ hrs a week on the first pair and held up 2 years). Sole bottom layer had separated on the right foot, but was easily remedied with glue.", "These by far are the most comfortable boots I have ever owned. First day out the box I wore them all day with arch supports.

Quality product that is bought every time to replace the old boots", "I'd have to say after finally finding the right steel toe boot, these are the winner! I purchased the wide in this same type and they were too wide. If you have a wide foot like I do, get the 9M's as they have sufficient room in them. I am on my feet all day and they are very comfortable. I only gave them 4 stars as they say slip resistent and I slid a bit over soapy water on concrete not too log ago.", "I\u2019ve been buying these boots for shipyard work for more than 20 years. The Vibram soles wear great! Awesome support and a really solid mid sole to fight against plantar faciitis. They are stiff at first.

Wasn\u2019t able to put my arch supports in. Considering sending them back", "These are great comfortable boots. I work 12 hour shifts and they work great for me. Just don\u2019t wear ankle socks.

My feet stay warm and dry stepping through slush and mud.", "This is the second pair I buy for my husband. He loves them and says they are very comfortable. He is on his feet all day and told me his feet never hurt when he wears these boots. The leather is high quality and they even look good with Dockers when he has to walk the production floor on occasion, he highly recommends these boots, also they are true to size", "I've worn steel-toed boots and shoes on job sites for 30 years, and these boots are the most comfortable I've ever owned. I buy a new pair of boots almost every year hoping that they will be the ones that don't blister my toes and ankles. They always did, until now. These are the holy grail of steel-toed boots.", "The best safety I have brought. Great for all day ware. Very comfortable. Please note to buy wide if needed as the boots are very true to size.", "These boots were comfortable right out of the box, they are light weight,and have held-up to a lot of hard use in construction, as well as operating and maintaining heavy equipment. I removed a star from my original review because I quickly discovered that neither the second pair I bought or the pair they sent to replace them were waterproof.", "This is my first pair of Timberland boots. I previously had a pair of Wolverine brand boots. The comfort level is night & day. These boots are MUCH more comfortable than my previous boots. I was a little hesitant to spend extra on a pair of boots, but now I'm glad I did. I would highly recommend these. I plan to get some Mink Oil to help make them last.", "I'm always worried when buying boots i never know if theyll be good enough. I work on cars all day these boots are perfect. When it says non slip it means it so comfortable too.", "I have been wearing these a few weeks now and I am happy with them. I bought them a half-size larger than my regular shoe size and that worked out well probably because of the work socks that I use with them. They were quite comfortable from the outset and they are doing a good job of protecting my feet while being subjected to some fairly rough usage. I would recommend them.", "Terrible. The toe in the right is cut different than the left. The steel toe is cut terrible,as soon as you put them on you knew it tear your toes/foot up. No cushion or arch and hard as a rock. Tried using an anti fatigue insole and did nothing to help. Returned......", "Great boot. Fits good and comfortable enough to last the day.", "were defective uppon arrival, had to use a dremil to remove material from inside the shoe to make it wearable. i work on abrasive non-slip mats all day and these are rubbed flat on the bottom after about 3-4 months. but their comfortable, my feet are one thing that dosent bother me", "One of the hooks for the shoe lace busted off during the first day of wearing these. That is cheap.", "After a couple of days where the boot makes adjustments to your foot now it's like wearing a glove, I've been wearing the PRO boots for about 5 years and I don't change it for anything, for me it's the best in the market.", "This is a superior workboot. Triple stitching everywhere I wear these in a very harsh environment and put alot of miles on them they last until the leather itself fails.", "I usually have no problems with these boots I buy a pair every year because I like the way they feel but this year I bought a new pair of only had it for 3 1/2 months and they\u2019re already falling apart and nothing is changed about the way I work yeah what are you doing", "Got the boots at the end of February. Haven't even had a chance to put them through real work as yard work season just began and the grommets for the laces have already started coming out of the leather due to lack of a good rivet.

Also very comfortable.", "Great boots! Not too heavy even with the steel toe. Fit great!", "I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves them. He actually already had this pair but they were a size too big and uncomfortable so trying on the new size he requested made a big difference.

Needed some all leather boots for welding etc. Very comfortable, breathable, and best of all, super tough. Highly recommended. They look great too. If you're like me and have a wide foot ( I think its EE size) then these are perfect. Plenty wide with room to spare.", "Boots were a little stiff at first, but after wearing for about a week they broke in nicely. I work in very hazardous work area with extreme chemicals.

Getting them there takes a little while. Before they get broken in they were a little rough on ankles.", "Igave 4 because metal shank at heal where it comes up on sides was cutting into heal solved by putting in an insert.

Ordered them from Amazon wore them for 1 week! One week that\u2019s it! And ALREADY the boot nose has torn off and the steel is exposed.

They are heavy but comfortable at all times", "As I am in the Automotive Industry I need my footwear to last and be comfortable. These boots do that wonderfully. I used to buy those cheap boots at the big stores and would be getting a new pair about every 4-5 months and the laces would break in about 3. I replaced the old pair that I had(these same ones in the natural leather color) and the soles still had tread on them.

Soles started to come undone. Would give it 1 star but they did work for a few months. Not worth the money thou", "I was not surprised nor disappointed in my purshase. These boots are pretty comfortable for a steel toe. However, I did purchase a wide and got just that, WIDE. they DO NOT lace up as tight as I had expected(the main reason for a 4star), but my guess is, that Timberlands are more of a loose fit boot then a tight ankle supporting boot. They serve the function for my demands. Be warned if you want a boot to lace up tight to the foot and ankle for added support in demanding duties.", "The only type of shoes I buy for work. Construction every day takes a toll on my feet, but these are the best (for me).", "My son is an electrician and needed a boot that would give great support, have excellent traction, have that safety steel toe, take A LOT of abuse and wear, and still look good and last A LONG TIME!

I have three hiking boots and do not have this problem. Sad with purchase.", "Finally replaced my Army boots after 10+ years, and wanted one pair of go-to footwear. These came highly recommended and I can see why. Good fit and finish, durable, protected my toes more than once in the first weekend I wore them, and actually look good with a jacket and jeans. Worth the money.", "RIGHT SHOE IS TEARING UP MY ANKLE ?????? why does the LEFT SHOE FIT AND FEELS PERFECT WHILE THE THE RIGHT SHOE IS LOOSER, WEAKER, AND NOT AS DURABLE. the right shoe has me in considerable ankle pain. i would the like a right shoe replacement. immediately", "I wear these boots every day. They last about a year and a half. Longer than any other boot I have bought. I am on my 6th pair. Great steel toe boots.", "I am a commercial electrician, my feet have theor fair share of tough days. This is my second time purchasing these boots. The last pair lasted me three years. Im expecting the same comfortable 3 years. Oh and i have elephant pad like flat feet. Fyi", "Seemed like nice boots however I returned them due to tight fit and uncomfortable at back of the heel, likely from being too small.", "Broke in fairly quickly and fits well.

Had them for two months and there still holding up like new in the concrete world!", "I love these shoes. This is my second set of this exact shoe.

I've bought Timberland for years and on this pair the sole already had gaps from the shoe and the label was sewn on crooked & not fully. disappointing for paying $100+", "Wonderful work boots that have held up well to daily wear and tear of a Welder who is on his feet all day.", "Shoes work good. I\u2019m a Field Engineer for heavy construction and they work great. If you have wide feet I suggest buying the wide pair.", "The boots were delivered with am imperfection. One boot is wider at the toe than the other. You can feel the differnce when your foot is placed inside as well as notice the size difference when lining them up sole to sole. Will be returing and reordering in hopes it was just a manufacture error and not a consistent problem product wide.", "I love Timberland Pro!

The shoes can still be used, but they are not tightening up very well.", "I spend 7.5 to 11.25 hours a day on my feet and weigh around 270lbs. I need a boot that can keep up with the work environment of a steel mill and this boot fulfills those needs. I bought these boots in the beginning of January 2013 and they are still holding up well as of June 2013. The soles, insoles, and uppers are all holding up well. Other boots on my job wear out in half the time of these. The boots are showing enough wear that I will be replacing them within the next couple of months. Buying these boots again.", "These are by far the most comfortable work boot I have ever had the pleasure of having on my feet. They are true to size, and do not run narrow as many boots are known to do. I am a delivery driver and had thought there was not a pair of boots that stay comfortable through the 12-14 hour days, but these boots have done it. I would recommend these to anyone who needs a tough, comfortable boot.", "My husband picked these shoes out for work and seems to really like them.

Very comfortable for being steel toe, I wear them all day every day", "My boyfriend had me buy this for him for work and he absolutely adores them.

Even among other Timberland Pro styles I have purchased and worn this seems to be be most comfortable and longest lasting for me. Lasted almost twice as long as others. That makes these boots a great value for a blue collar worker like myself.", "I know these boots are awesome they just fit a little bit small for my son's foot whom I bought these boots for. All the way I had to return this pair I will be purchasing a half size larger once my son returns from a three-month job overseas.", "Purchased for my son as he needed steel toed shoes for his new job. He likes them. He wears them every day. They have not rubbed any blisters. While he gets use to the new job, his feet are tired but they are not sore.", "Only complaint is the piece inside the heal of the boots, it digs into the side of my heal, and after 8.5 hours of work, I usually end up in some pain.

I have found these to be more durable but not quite as comfortable. The Pro Endurance both lasted me 10 months and these have lasted 12 months and are showing some wear but are still in solid shape.

I needed them for the day after, so no time to return :-(", "I will not buy another type of work boot after owning these boots. I have owned competitors boots in the past and feel that I have spent ALOT of money on inferior quality boots.

Time will tell.", "I just starter riding my Harley again and changing gears hurt my toes, I have wore steel toe boots before and other than being heavy they are great!!", "Decent boots so far. Need to break in better defiantly stiff. Sole inserts are not really nice ones but about what I would except for price. Have to lace up tight and double tie to keep tight and tied.", "These are sturdy, rugged, but not heavy, which is a good thing. I had to take a few days to break them in but no issues.", "Fits as expected, a little rough to break in on the sides of my heel, more so in my left foot, the heel dug into my foot when in certain positions.

I work assembly so I'm standing for a minimum of eight hours each work day, and quite often more. I slot in some worker's gel insoles, and these boots give me no problems whatsoever.

Ive had red wings, caterpillar, wolverine, works by red wing, and many others. All of these previous boots had a break in period ranging from 1-3 weeks! These Pitbosses felt great right out the box. Super comfortable and good looking. The steel isn't noticeable on any of my toes. I would not hesitate to buy these again or to recomend them to anyone.", "My feet would like a little higher arch support but other than that, they are great! I can use my good feet arch supports in them if I need to but at this point they are working great without them. Not too warm for summer wear and I'm sure they will work well for winter too.", "Way too narrow for a size 14. Poor design in the Achilles area. A lot of arch support but with the lack of support and looseness in the back it's like wearing a reverse high heel or something. Doc martens fit way better for similar price.", "I would recommend to anyone that have flat feet. They are comfortable even after being on your feet all day long. Great price and fit.", "Fits just like advertised. Very comfortable. Nice quality. This pair replaced a pair I've had for 6 years. Wore them until I wore out the sole.", "Ordered these in april. It's june now and there's no sign of these wearing out. Much better than other work boots.", "Very good work boots... they take a beating and hold up well.

Thanks for the great boots", "Seem to be a great boot and holding up well", "I work in a factory and every day of the week im on my feet sometimes walking around other days just standing in one place for 3-4 hours at a time. these boots have held up very well, leather is tough and so far the soles haven't worn down too much yet. more than anything these boots are comfortable. the first couple weeks of owning them i didn't have any insoles but eventually i invested in some Dr scholls custom orthotics and this combo keeps my feet from being sore! they truly are great boots", "used these boots for fourty years and they were the best boots on the market. I just received a new pair and I thought they felt tight but it\u2019s the same size I\u2019ve always ordered.

The boots are great, but this is not what I paid $90+ for.", "Boot quality is pretty good. Wide foot option is not as wide as expected, my toes something smash against each other.

My suggestion: don't buy Timberland boots for functionality, especially at over $100 a pair.", "Lasted 2 years.. the insoles finally wore out too much. I would buy these again in a heartbeat. I kept them waxed pretty good and other than a few scratches from steel the outside is still intact", "Husband loves them. Comfortable and true to size. Got the dark brown and love the color. Always get wheat and this is a nice change.", "I originally ordered the 9 regular and they felt way tight, especially in the toe. I didn't think the steel would stretch out (obviously) so I tried the 9 wide and with thick socks they fit great. They are actually a very comfortable boot. I haven't had them out in inclement weather yet but will assume they will hold up well.", "Normally I buy Timberland boots because they fit my foot and are usually reasonably priced. The only thing that makes me hesitant is the last few pairs I have bought have fallen apart within weeks. The pro steel toe is different than other Timberland boots in the fact that I have worn them now for several months with heavy bending and use, and they still look like new. I am very pleased with this boot and will probably be buying a second pair soon.", "I was wary about buying something like this online. That being said they fit perfectly and are very comfortable.

I am still breaking this new pair in, but so far they are as expected. Great boot for the price.", "an excellent choice,ideal for me as I have a narrow foot - the sole liner is the best I have ever had in a boot - the upper ankle support was a bit stiff to start with,but after a bit of massaging became very comfortable - I have been wearing Mack boots for the last 15 years,am now a convert to Timberland - I originally wanted Cat boots,but Amazon does not send them out of the USA - I am in Brisbane,Australia", "Seems like excellent quality for the money.

Might be a little warm for warmer weather but I will have to see that when the time comes. Would definitely buy again.", "I would have loved the boots but they were too small.

So i'm very happy with this purchase.", "I had ordered these boots because I had gotten the same pair in the past and they were great. When I got the pair from the Amazon website I was upset because these $100 boots had come packaged smooshed. It is making wearing them very uncomfortable. I was happy that the last pair had a brief, 1 day maybe, break-in period and they had lasted me a year. This pair is hard to wear even for a day without the squished structure of the boots digging into my foot and ankle.

To replace it we would have to send it in and pay almost half the price of the boot.", "I like these a lot but I think I would have to go with a slightly bigger boot size. I really don't want to as it will feel like I'm wearing a huge shoe but the steel cuts a bit short and crams the pinky toe in.

Usually I have to break in a boot until they are comfortable but these were immediately comfortable. I'm happy with the purchase.", "These boots fit perfectly and look great! They are comfortable from the start-no break-in needed. In the past I have bought Red Wing boots, which are very good boots, but cost 3 times as much. The Red Wings also hurt my feet for a couple of weeks until they were broken in. These boots had no such problems. The only downsides are 1) Not made in USA, made in the Dominican Republic but at least they are not made in China, and 2) they are made of man-made materials and not leather. But you are not going to get either of those features without paying much more.", "So far the shoes are OK. Found one long scratch on the shoe . not to sure if it is a manufacturing defect or was caused during shipping. However I did find it strange it came without the usual paper ball .

Wish it had a warranty for if it wears out in a few months.", "I got an amazing deal on these boots back in the winter, and the quality still surprises me to this day.

Then order another pair of these a few weeks later.", "I work on an airport ramp so I put lots of tear on a pair of boots. These were garbage. I compare all my boots to the first cheap pair of Walmart boots I first wore out there. The slight glance at a puddle of water and my socks were wet.

Timberland didn't have that size so I went with the 2E. Love these shoes.

The leather is very durable, but the tread seems to be wearing down faster than my last pair. I only bought them two months ago, and work 40hrs a week in a warehouse environment.

I think they have discontinued making them and are selling the ones they have left... they are so cute but they don't stay cute for long", "I am using fitflops' for a few years but these pair is the best I have had ! They are very comfortable and my feet have enough room inside beautifully! The color is very special and although I bought them last year- I started to use them 2 weeks ago! I always like to have a new pair standby...I surely buy another pair like this!!!", "I love these shoes, but the patent leather cracked the first time I wore them. Do not buy!!!", "The top of the shoe leaves a nice indentation on the top of my foot. Would consider that I purchased the wrong size however, if I got a larger size, there is no way my foot would fit into it. I've had these shoes for about 6 month and nothing has changed. Same issue with my Danskos as I wear them for work.", "I had to send them back, despite ordering the same size that fits me just fine in 3 other kinds of FFs. The color is lovely and the cushioning feels pretty much in line with other FFs, but the toe box is TINY. Normally I have plenty of extra room for thick socks and toe wiggling, but even trying on barefoot it's snug in the toes. If other FFs are too big/wide for you in that area, this might be a good choice for you, but if you're looking at these because you like the fit of the other FitFlops in your collection, walk on by and get something else.", "I like how comfortable this shoe is. When the weather is better I wear them as my daily go to pair of shoes. I slip them on and I know I can go all day in comfort and the color adds some pizzazz to my wardrobe. This is the second time I've bought this shoe and it's the 3rd pair of fitflops I own right now.", "I am a HUGE fan of Fitflop. I have many different styles. I even bought a pair of sandals to wear as slippers in my house in summer. Another pair of sandals I wore when hiking...I know! So, when I saw these pair, I just had to get them for work (working at a surgery center on my feet for 10 hours). Very happy to say that, once again, Fitflop came through proving they are truly very comfortable and long lasting shoe brand. After a long shift, my feet are not tired at all. Easy to slip on, slip off, with great rubber grip for the O.R. floors.", "This is my second pair of Fitflop mules. I am an OR nurse that works12 hour shifts. I'm on my feet all day either scrubbing or circulating. My FitFlops are by far the best work shoes I have ever wore in my 9 years of being a nurse. My first pair of FitFlops lasted a year before the sides started to break down. I'm only giving this pair 3 stars because they have only lasted me FOUR months. The material is starting to crack and I'm getting cramps in my left foot. I'm not sure why unless they were not a true Fitflop brand???", "The most comfortable shoe; I could not live without ... Former ballet dancer, currently nursing a foot injury. Take care of your feet! I wear these as my everyday shoes, easy to slip on and off. The front of the shoe is properly shaped to allow your toes to spread out naturally, sooo comfortable. Love!", "This mule is very comfortable . I originally bought it for work since i had been having lots of foot pain for being on my feet all day. I have spent so many dollars on different brand shoes but nothing really gave me comfort until i found this. Because of it's comfort i use it all the time even during vacations. I would want to buy more pairs in different colors if the price is right. At present it's almost $100, I wish the price would go lower. But i would highly recommend this shoe.", "\u2764\ufe0f l wore my shoes for the first time, eight hrs, at work and Standing the entire time.The shoes were bought to replace A pair of $ 200+ clogs that due to their weight ,were aggravating my torn meniscus. These clogs not only offer support but are light in weightl,there by, not tiring your feet or aggravating an already aggravated knee.Very pleased with this purchase and will buy again.", "Great color and super comfortable. I keep them at work (I'm a nurse) and they are great for all day wear. My only minor complaint is that they're kind of hot. It's not surprising I suppose since they're patent leather clogs, but I'm a little on the hot natured side and I HATE for my feet to be hot. When it happens, I just change shoes for awhile. That's really not a criticism of the shoes, but it's something to keep in mind if you don't like super warm feet.", "Sizing is true...I take an 8 in other shoes, and the 8 in the shuv patent mule fits. My feet are on the wider side, so FitFlops have room for my wide foot. These shoes are very shiny. I probably wouldn't like that except that I wear them to work (I'm a nurse), so shiny is OK. They're comfortable enough to wear for a 12-hour shift without a problem.", "I like fiflops and have a few pairs. The fit is true to size, and I wear a 9m. My heel stops right at the edge of the open heel, and my toes fit comfortably in the toe box. The only thing I have noticed with these is the shoe rubs my left big toe nail. Not enough for discomfort though. These don't have the give the felt, suede or leather have, but still are comfortable. The color is nice and bright too!", "It is hard to imagine a more comfortable shoe than the FitFlop Shuv! The quality, design and fit are superb, as well as attractive! I was concerned that they might look clunky, but they are so cute, shiny, waterproof and look a bit like boots when worn with pants. Although they are expensive, I expect to have they for many years. Because Amazon Prime offers free returns and you receive merchandise within two days, I would not hesitate to buy another pair of FitFlops.", "Good support - I love Fitflops. The top lip of the shoe aggravated the top of my foot a bit during first couple of times wearing, but that has gone away. Finish durable and resistant to scuffs. Comfortable all day - and I am on my feet most of the time. Size 8 fit as expected - in relation to two other FitFlops I own. I would say the sole seems a bit harder and stiffer than my flip flop sandals from the summer or slip ons ordered earlier this fall.", "The most comfortable clog that I know. have bought the same brand and worn for the last seven years! my feet are happy after standing and walking all day in them. To all nurses out there, you might want to try fitflop mules/clogs for your day to day use especially on those hard floors.", "Fitflops are the few brands that i can wear with these arthritic feet. They are wonderful.", "I got a different one from the picture it has a purple inside and already for 2 years it makes my socks and tights purple.. make sure it has the leather inside! but its still amazing and comfy its just a little annoying when you foot gets purple...", "Careful of 20 percent restocking fee. I have many pair of fit flops. This pair did not fit, too tight. I should have paid more attention. A lesson learned.", "Love these fitflops , they are nice and classy. Im really happy with them!", "Perfect for my job as dental hygienist. Comfortable and the patent leather can be wiped as needed with sanitizing wipes that I use to wipe equipment and countertops in the operatory!", "The most comfortable shoes ever! I buy these to wear around the house and when we go on trips where a lot of walking is required. Because of the thick and soft soles, I can stand all day without feeling tired. I have like 15 pairs of fitflops and will not stop buying them.", "Able to wear with regular socks whereas my other pair of fit flop clogs need thicker socks because they are heavier.Love these hot cherry FitFlops but so far only wearing a couple of hours at a time to break them in. All my FitFlops are super comfortable and really help eliminate back pain.I don't know how I just noticed that when I put them on in the afternoon that my pain disappeared. Now I put them on first thing in the morning.", "This is my 3rd pair pf these. My other 2 pairs are starting to wear after several years. I love these shoes because they are so easy to slip into, are attractive, and they ARE Fit Flops!! If you love Fit Flops like I do, you'll love these.", "Due to having \u201cflat-feet\u201d, I am only comfortable wearing FitFlop brand. I am in the medical field and stand for most of my shift. I have tried Dansko, Sanita and Anywhere clogs but find FitFlop clogs to be the best for me!!!!!", "Wore mules around the house a couple of days and wore them outside first time today. Really like them but am concerned they are fragile and succeptable to scuffing. Length is perfect. Width is larger than expected. Wore them about three hours today without any discomfort. I am also concerned about how long they'll hold up and remain looking great. Thus, I will not wear them everyday or all day. Love the patent leather and shoe design!", "I love these shoes!!! Although they look like galoshes under my jeans, but I love the color and the shine of the patented leather.", "Love Fitflops! This one little boxy in the toe area.", "Great mules for the weekends..my nurse loved them!! They run true to size n enhance my Fitbit walks...style, practical, healthy!!!", "These shoes fit as comfortably as expected. I purchased 3 other styles of FitFlops earlier in the year and they are now my happy shoes because I no longer have heel pain when I wear them. My disappointment with this shoe is because the patent leather top has cracked and split on the right shoe. I have only worn them as I usually do and not it bad weather etc.", "I love fitflop shoes! And these did not disappoint. I have an extremely high instep and worried about the fit. They fit wonderfully! I am quite happy! They offer comfort, support and cushion.", "Update. Ive been wearing them to work for the last 6mos and with all the heavy lifting and walking they're doing great. My fasciitis is about 98% better. I'm truly happy. Change the fabric used for the insole and it's a 5* product any day of the week.", "Fit larger than expected. Otherwise AWESOME clog. I got all my co-workers to buy a pair, too. I've had mine for 2 1/2 years and they are still very comfortable and supportive. Your legs/feet won't hurt while standing for long periods of time.", "Shiney! Supportive cushy comfort great for lotsof worksteps n pivots. Shiney's Good! A bit ...sweaty...but they're clogs so.....", "I have purchased many styles of Fitflops and have found this style to fit me the best. Styles differ in length and width, but this style is consistent to size. I have 3 pairs of this style and they are the only shoes I wear all fall and winter here in the southwest. :)", "I have many pairs of fitflops and love them. So comfortable. Highly recommend.", "Looked very nice brand new, but after just two months of moderate wear (3 days a week) they\u2019ve cracked and peeled at every seam. Absolutely not worth the money.", "I am very disappointed with this purchase, the shoe cracked after only a month of wearing! (See pictures).I wish I can return them. I have previously purchased of the same shoes but different color and did not have any problem.", "Luv this...light n sturdy..only when u wear them 12 hours..ur feet perspire..hut theyre so comfy", "These shoes are to large. 2-long, 2-wide. Can I exchange for a size 7? Thank you Jacqueline Trux", "these shoes/clogs are wonderful for people like me with chronic heel and knee pain. I put these on and I have painless walking. I have them in most colors and wear them almost 24/7. Love them. They last forever (have had one pair over 5 years now) and they always feel great", "Super comfortable for someone like me who\u2019s had six foot surgeries and still has foot issues.", "Im an average width, I have purchased 8 before so I knew it would fit.", "I really like the look of these shoes and wore them for several hours. However, the ball-areas of both feet behind my toes became extremely sore, despite the shoes fitting well. Perhaps I needed to \"break in\" the shoes, but that is not typical for my experience with FitFlops. I'll certainly try again to acclimate my feet to these shoes. I want them to work for me.", "Unable to wear the shoes, as they are really big. Will be returning them. Well-made product, I love the color, seems to have a good arch, and a nice solid foundation, but the size is too big. Shoes are not offered in half-sizes, only whole sizes, which probably contributes to the significant size difference.", "Love these just like all the other fitflop shoes I have first time for this style. Size is good. Color is absolutely lipstick red. Leather inside. Like the heel height. Makes feel a little taller. Will consider buying again depending on how these hold up.", "I really love these shoes. They run large (a Fitflop US size 11 is EU 43 while most US size 11's are EU 42), but I plan to wear them in the winter with socks - and these will accommodate nice thick socks. These shoes are unbelievably comfortable. The color is fun - bright red.", "My feet have become so used to the comfort these shoes provide, I hardly want to wear anything else. I have 3 other pairs, and they all feel great on my overworked and tired feet. If you spend a lot of time walking, standing these will help with leg, and foot fatigue.", "These are so comfortable! I usually wear a 10-10.5, but I ordered these is size 11 to compensate for any foot swelling, since I'm 8 months pregnant. They are perfect! A little tight on the top but I can tell that they will contour to my feet the more I wear them. I got them in Indian Green and the color looks amazing! It's surprisingly neutral and goes with almost any color I choose to wear. Best shoes I've bought in a while!", "This product is very comfortable and has great arch support.", "Super comfortable, I normally wear a wide and these fit my feet comfortably. I tried them on at the end of the day when my feet and ankles are swollen from arthritis. They felt great!", "I'm walking on sunshine, YEAH! Nicely mad, attention to detail, hidden closures of all ends of the stitching. Highly recommend if you have no arch under your feet. Oh and I love the color of course, my fav.....Green!", "I normally wear a size 8.5m. This style fits smaller than other 8M styles by Fit Flop. This is my 4th pair of FitFlops in a size 8M and I have worn the others a lot. My heel was almost coming off the back of this shoe. I kept it and plan to wear thin socks or none in warm weather. Otherwise I would have returned it. It took awhile to get used to it because it was stiff due to being patent leather and it wore a blister on one side but eventually it softened up and I like them.", "Love these clogs. I have neuropathy in my feet so they keep me sturdy and balanced. Very comfortable for a full day. I wear a size 9 1/2 and got a size 10 with a little extra room. The colors are great. I have 3 pairs. Lots of compliments.", "Straight out of the box I wore these on a whirlwind trip from Seattle to Chicago, London, Budapest and Vienna, in winter no less! The were warm, waterproof and as with all FitFlops made it possible to walk all over up and down creation. I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone!", "Fit very comfortably, like the fit flops that I wear and love in the summer. However the patent leather splits anywhere there is a crease. It has also separated from the sole on the side, forcing the patent to crunch down and look very unattractive. I still wear them, but only around the house and would not recommend for such a high price.", "I love it but the one I have doesn't look like the picture it is more flat with a slight wedge not a big wedge all over.", "I have other pairs of these and wanted a different color. It is a great shade of blue, not real dark. Fitflops are the only shoe and sandal that I wear year round. They are comfortable and look very stylish. I get lots of compliments on these shoes.", "Absolutely love these! Definitely a \"wear all day\" shoe. I usually wear an 8 1/2-9 and bought a 9. These fit more like an 8 1/2, but still an excellent fit. This pair fit slightly smaller than my other two pairs of Fitflops. Definitely want to buy more.", "if you are a 1/2 size, order down. It does run a bit wide, it would not work for narrow feet.", "Disappointed. Uncomfortable. I own 15 pairs of Fitflops, sandals (slides and thongs) and boots and they are all fabulously comfortable. This is the only style that is not comfortable. Ended up wasting $100 and not wearing them. Bummer.", "These are the BEST shoes!!! They are very light, provide excellent arch support for my high arches and are very comfortable. I have bad knees and these shoes help me walk and stay on my feet longer. They are also a gorgeous cherry color. I just love them!", "Great shoe this my 3rd pair of the shuv patent I have black, red and now navy no cracking however this pair ran larger than I normally wear no big deal I\u2019m keeping them you might want to order a size smaller", "These are GREAT shoes, but I have an extremely high arch & have a difficult time wearing clogs. These shoes have Great support. I have suede ones & they stretched with my foot. With Patent Leather they tend to keep their shape & not stretch. I wish I could have been able to keep these lovely shoes! Plus they are over $120 at Nordstroms & only approximately $70 here from Amazon!!!! Super Deal!!!! EJM", "Used for grocery, running errands. Comfortable clogs. Well made. Will also use them for travel since they asked you to remove your shoes in the airport, might as well use this clogs for travel soon. Love them!", "Really comfortable shoes. I wear an 11.5 and the 11 fit perfectly. I'm a nurse and on my feet for 12-14 hours a day, and these are some of the best feeling shoes ever. They also hold up to spills and splashes; I've gotten various bodily fluids on them and they wipe off beautifully. These shoes are so wonderful, I even got my mother a pair!", "I bought these for my daughter, she loves them. She loves the comfort, the hight, the color. She puts them on the minute she gets home.", "I have bought over 15 pair of Fitflops over the years. The inside of the shoe that makes contact with one's heel is not as soft as it used to be. This is a disappointment. Company says that no changes have been made to the manufacturing process of the inside but I disagree. These shoes are not comfortable for people suffering from plantar fasciitis", "I wear these for work in the hospital and they are perfect. Super comfortable.", "I have many pairs of FitFlops and have never had a problem before. I am so disappointed in these shoes. I have just started wearing them a few weeks ago and leather is cracking on both shoes. They look terrible! I cannot wear them. How upsetting.", "Perfect fit. I have a stand up desk at work and these shoes are excellent. I can stand comfortably all day. I originally purchased them because I have flat feet and needed something that was low heel, but not flats. I love them.", "So cool looking..... Get many compliments...and my feet say thank you!!! Shiny leather in a cherry color red. Not a loud red... But works with almost everything!!! Have blue suede, orange suede, black, tan, and love them all!!!!!!!!", "Bought these to replace a previous pair of black patent Van Gogh mules from FitFlop. They do not fit the same at all. Toe box is way smaller and my feet hurt an hour into my 12 hour shift. Haven't worn them since.", "As usual FitFlop has made a wonderful shoe. You can walk for miles in this shoe. They do fit a little loose (width wise) but a thicker sock does the trick. They are a beautiful, high shine, patent leather and look great with pants or casual dresses or leggings.", "I always order a size 8, however these seem to squeeze my foot in the arch area, not the ball of my foot that is widest but closer up to the ankle. I still love them. I am hoping they will give a little.", "I got a gree \"Ugly\" color and look was clumsy and orthopitic when you put them on. I returned ASAP", "I fell in love with this shoe! I bought too big, but wore anyway. My rating is because the parent leather cracked were your toes nend when you walk. One year I can understand, three months is unacceptable.", "They are a bit smaller fit than usual for FitFlops, but not to bad. Your heal will be all the way to the back of the shoe. You can't really size up on FitFlops too much or your foot doesn't fit the footbed very well.", "The fit is perfect. Very comfortable. I stand behind a chair for 8hrs a day doing hair. I have no leg aches! I get lots of compliments on the color!!! They are great. I don't wear anything other than fit flop", "Just as comfortable as all my other FitFlops. Nothing is more comfortable on your feet.", "Right shoe completely cracked all the way across the top. I will never buy Fit Flop shoes again. Too much money for an inferior product", "Sent it back. Picture made it look like patten leather.", "Tight in the toe area ... too wide in the rest of the shoe ... have \"walked\" right out of them. I use them for \"wet grass shoes\", so I kept them, but cannot wear for shopping, etc.", "I love these shoes! I wear a women's size 8 normally, I got this in a 7 and it fits perfect. I love these, so comfy and cute, I've had so many complements on them.", "Fits as expected in length and width. However the leather is so stiff it will take some time to break in where shoe rubs top of feet.", "My second pair in 5 years. I wear them everywhere. They can be both formal (patent) or informal and they are very comfortable. Great arch support too!", "Ok ladies, as a gal who stands on her feet daily as a cosmetolgist for the past 35 years and has feet issues. These are the shoes for you! I need a larger toe box, and arch support. These clogs has both! True to size. Crazy comfortable shoes that I would highly recommend! Bonus: super easy to clean, hair wipes right off them!!", "I love FitFlops and this is another type of shoe from them. I've got sandals, boots, flats and now a clog. They are really comfortable. You can walk all day in them and you still have a spring in your step.", "Will probably be returning shoes at some point...have not decided yet. The shoe would fit better if it were the newer, slimmer shoe made by Fitflop. Have ordered another pair and am going to compare them when they arrive.", "I have these in another color but wanted to get the black patent as well. They have so much support and I can keep them on all day without my feet hurting. I get so many compliments on them.", "After 2 months the patent leather is cracking and it looks like plastic.", "We spent our summer vacation in a 50 family gated community and these fit flops were all the rage!!! I need to get another pair cause my daughters keep taking them! They are so comfy!! Some of my friends got them in a few colors!", "So very comfortable, another great shoe for walking around in. However it makes your foot very hot in the sunnier climates. The color is as rich as the picture.", "Tried to wear these but the Top Piece is just to high and wears against the ankle Not a good buy for my foot", "Love them! Obviously I love fit flops. This was my 31st, yes I said 31st, pair of them. I wear nothing but fit flops. I think fit flop should hire me as a spokesperson for their product. I could model about all of their styles from my own closet!!!!!!!!!", "Size wasn't the problem as much as the fact that the wonderful arch support I always get with FitFlops simply wasn't there! Too flat inside! I was very surprised. I'm returning these. =(", "Very comfortable! Lots of compliments. But, people think I work in the medical field when I wear them. They're just a great clog.", "Extremely comfortable, looks very pretty on, got a lot of compliments... Only drawback I personally found was that my feet sweat and become a drop smelly. But for me I feel it's still worth it for comfort", "Great shoe, I bought a 10 I need a 9. This shoe does give some. Great shoe. I WILL replace with proper size.", "I liked my shoes so much ,I was leaving when they arrived and went back to open the box put them on and wore them all day .Great fit,I have about 6 pair now .", "I appreciated these shoes coming early but very disappointed that they have begun cracking in less than two months with minimal wear!", "This is the most comfortable work show if you have to stand and walk a lot.

Am going to order another pair!", "The structure and color was great. It just wasn't a good fit.", "Love these! I have a wide foot so FitFlops are usually my friends. Wish I would have bought a few more colors when I caught them on sale for $29 here.", "I love all my fit flop flip flops! So I thought I'd try a clog. This one is awesome. Fits perfectly and has the fit flip shoe bed. I could not be happier.", "Love theses for work wish fit flop would get more creative with patterns and colors nurses would love that!!

Just can't beat it for all day comfort.", "FitFlop shoes are really GREAT!!! The Due brand of FitFlop are true to size. So I must admit that I expected a similar fit. The Shuv Patent Mule runs a little small to size and wide. The Hot Cherry colour is simply delicious! Which is why I ordered this shoe in the first place. The comfort of the FitFlop Shuv Patent Mule is incomparable... as with ALL FitFlop shoes! So this shoe may not be very attractive, but the colour is fabulous and the comfort and ease of walking is amazing! The price point of this Seller is beyond phenomenal!

I purchased this style in red and black leather . They have the comfort that I am used too, but not the fit. They tend to allow my feet to slip around .

Little bit sweaty since it's so closed.", "Love them, I have at least 9 pairs of fit flops which include a pair of sneakers.

FitFlops are my #1 shoe choice.", "ordered 2 pair of this style and had to return because of a defect in the footbed of one of the pairs which made me skeptical. reordered the cherry and i'm glad i did because the fit is amazing, it's lightweight and the color is great.", "I love my Fitflops.

I'm heartbroken over the quality of this pair. Did something change?", "So comfortable for working 12-hour overnight shifts as a nurse!

I will introduce my friends to them.", "I actually ordered what is pictured, the red shoes but I received deep plum instead. I really prefer the style I ordered, but I hate returning things, so I am wearing them anyway. They are also too large, but I will compensate and just wear thick socks during the cooler months. Disappointed, but I like how they feel when I compensate with the thick socks. I would just like to be able to wear them year-round. Wish I had the red ones, they look to be designed a bit less bulbous.", "Love Fit Flops and these are nice...I like their slippers better but they fit true to size and are very comfortable.

Along with flip flop style and the clog style Fitflop this makes it the 5th shoe I've bought from them.", "If you're going to buy Fit Flop Clogs, I'd go ahead and pay for the leather ones. They are much softer and fit to your foot. These patent leather ones are cute, but they never seem to soften up. I only wear Fit flops, both sandals and clogs.

Also the stiff top was hitting the front ankle wedge. It's too much trouble to return, so I'll keep.", "Beautiful blue, but smaller than my 3 pairs of size 9 fitflop sandals, so I am returning for size 10.

I'm in love with anything FitFlop makes, but this is just a flop flop. The shoe is hard to stay on and always slips out when walking. The back of the shoe is ridiculously painful when this happens.

My right foot is ever so slightly smaller than the left so since they don\u2019t have 9.5, I ordered a 10. They fit perfectly on the left and slightly big on the right. They also sent pads and extra heel soles. I put the pads in the right one and it made the fit better. I also love how they have the expansive backing for a better fit. Can\u2019t wait to wear these at my wedding. The heel is also the perfect height and not tall so I feel I can keep them on a little longer than the ceremony.", "I got these in blue for my wedding shoes and they were a big hit! Lots of compliments on them throughout the day and the photographers got some cool shots with them. BUT they need to be broken in! The toes pinched me a lot, so I needed to wear them around the house and do the blow dryer trick. So keep that in mind for timing. They aren\u2019t super comfortable, but manageable for heels.", "I love these shoes! It was getting really hard to find ivory shoes that are actually ivory instead of stark white. These were the 6th pair I bought online and I finally got exactly what I was looking for. I usually like a higher heel, but these look great on and they're so incredibly comfortable, I was willing to trade the heel for some comfort for my wedding day. They are beautifully vintage and they're more sparkley than the pictures.", "These shoes are beautiful. However, I am a size 7.5, and since the shoes don't come in half sizes, I had to choose the 8. When I received them, I tried them on and they were HUGE. I kept them, just in case, but even with filler and padding, it was too big. So, I'm going to send it back and order them again in size 7. So, order at least one size smaller :-)", "I was very excited to receive my shoes and when I got them I went straight to open them up and try them on. They fit decently, they were a little big which is what I wanted so I could put cushions in, I'm a size 7 1\\2-8 and ordered an 8. The color, however, will not work. I needed a deep red and these were HOT PINK! It's very upsetting because they would have been perfect but the color was not right. The images are not true to color either. I will be returning. While the shoes seem to be good quality, they're useless to me as is.", "These are gorgeous shoes! I am SO happy I bought them! I was nervous that the heel would be really high and I would have trouble moving around in these shoes but upon receiving my pair I found that they are actually more of a pump and very comfortable. I am a 9.5 with wide feet. That said, I rounded up and ordered a size 10. The shoes hug my feet perfectly! They do not fall off but they also are not too tight for my foot. However, the shoes do come with inserts for those who may need them to improve the fit. I highly recommend these shoes! They truly are elegant and very well made!", "Love these shoes! Just as beautiful as pictured and comfortable fit. Can't wait till my wedding to walk these down the aisle.", "Beautiful shoe, perfect for my ivory dress unfortunately the larger sizes don't seem to have the same \"too big\" fit issue as smaller sizes. I am a 10-11 US so I ordered the 11 to be cautious & they are too snug to be comfortable all day with the amount of standing, walking & dancing I'll be doing. They match my dress perfectly though so I've ordered a shoe stretcher & really hoping I can make these work.", "Had a 10 pound dress on all day for pictures and all night for reception. Only took these shoes off for 1 hour in an 11 hour period. They were very comfy! Of course some pain towards the end but I was running, jumping, dancing nonstop in them during reception. Really, for a 3 inch heel, they were excellent! A small tip: I took 2 tablets of motrin before reception because my back was aching from the heavy dress and I think it also contributed to holding off the pain to my feet.", "So since these shoes don\u2019t come in half sizes i got a size smaller. I\u2019m usually a 9.5 and got a 9. Length of the shoe was fine but the width in from was a bit tight for me. So to help fix that problem i purchased a shoe stretcher and it has helped so much! These shoes are beautiful and everyone loves them. I plan to wear them on my wedding day! Definitely worth every penny which wasn\u2019t much compared to the prices of other wedding shoes on the market. And the height is great! I\u2019m very tall so i like smaller heels.", "These shoes are gorgeous. They fit very comfortable although I haven't worn them for a long period. I'm going to order them in two other colors. Wow! This was definitely a good buy. Update: I bought another pair in burgundy. It wasn't as dark as it showed on the website, but it definitely looks classy. No regrets. I think these shoes are well worth the price. I'd buy another one if I had something to wear them with.", "Just wore these shoes in black to a wedding. I was the mother of the bride. I cannot say enough about these shoes except absolutely perfect. I wear an 8 and that's the size i ordered fit was perfect. I received so many compliments. So comfortable i just wish i was going somewhere else bc i would buy these but in another color.", "Shoes are gorgeous and would be otherwise perfect if \"white\" meant wedding white. Unfortunately, the shoes are definitely ivory. Normally this wouldn't matter but when you're dealing with what are clearly wedding shoes... the difference between white and ivory is a big deal. They are beautiful and well made and fit great but they look dirty next to my dress. Good thing no one is going to see them anyway but it would have been nice to know that they don't mean paper white on a wedding item.", "I bought these for my wedding day, when I got them I couldn't wait to try them on. I am not really good with wearing heels but these are only 3 inches, I have put them on a couple times walking around the house, they are comfortable (which I never thought I would say about heels) and fit my foot perfectly and they are absolutely beautiful! I can't wait till my wedding day!!!", "I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and the price. I am thinking about changing the color of the dress that I am wearing and if I do I will certainly repurchase these shoes in a matching color. The fit of the shoe is great too...As I am a size 11, it's usually the box that fits better! It was great to know that I can have a shoe that will look this nice and still be very comfortable. The packing was done very nicely too...", "I wear sizes 7-8, depending on the shoe/brand so I chose an 8 for this one. It fit almost perfectly, but the manufacturer was kind enough to add little heel inserts, as well as orthotics for the balls of the feet, to make sure the shoe was as comfortable as possible! The color is lovely and the quality is truly better than I thought I would get for the price and from an online store. I am SO excited to wear these to my wedding in May :) Thanks, Elegant Park!", "THESE ARE NOT RED. I wanted so badly for them to look exactly like the photo but they are definitely not red, they are for sure burgundy. Still very pretty and not that worried about the color since no one will even see the under my wedding dress. But if you\u2019re looking for a true red, these are NOT your shoe.", "After trying on multiple pairs of Badgley Mischka's, I ended up wearing these for my wedding. They were perfect and fit very well. There's a small elastic band on the inside of the heel, which made them feel secure walking around and on the dance floor. The rhinestones on the side or kind of stung together rather than individually sewn on, but you can't tell unless looking very closely. The heel was also the exact height I needed - not too tall to be uncomfortable or taller than my groom, but more sophisticated than a kitten heel. I also loved the open-toe look, which kept it from being too serious.", "These are gorgeous! I love them! They come with pads and extra pads for heals. They shine and are clean. I wear a size 7.5. I ordered up because I see some ladies saying you have to break them in or toes scrunch up. They fit me perfect. It depends on the feet and width of toes. I had some room but not much to tumble over or the heel to fall off. They are perfect!", "The overall fit of the product was Ok, however it looked very cheap. The rhinestones in the pictures look nice, however up close and in person look cheap and poor quality. Returned them. I was looking for wedding shoes and these just didn't look that classy.", "I bought these shoes for my daughter's wedding and they were comfortable during the entire event! They come with inserts to help make them fit better, if needed. They are beautiful and fun. The heel is not too high, but gives your legs a longer look. I highly recommend them.", "I adored the way they looked and they looked perfect on my feet. I usually wear a wide width dress shoe and these are not wide width. I wore them for a while in the house and I felt my toes being squeezed. I decided I do not want to go through the night in pain so I sent them back.", "The shoe is gorgeous there's no doubt about that however although it fit, adter wearing them for an hour you'll start to feel the pain. Its a little tight at the front and gets worst the longer you have them on. id recommend a size up", "These shoes were absolutely gorgeous and excellent quality. I have wide feet so unfortunately they were a little to small for me. If you have wide feet I would recommend ordering a half size up if you can. I hope you find this review helpful. Please let me know if you do.", "Beautiful! I absolutely love these shoes I bought for my upcoming wedding. They are so comfortable, fit great, and are really beautiful! The heel is the perfect height as well. The seller included some comfort gels and extra heel tips which I thought was a really nice touch. Very pleased with these!", "These shoes are beautiful for the price. The applique\u0301s are not real rhinestones, but you cannot tell unless you are holding the shoe up very close to your eyes. The craftsmanship is perfect and the company is very generous in providing extra heel tips as well as padding for the shoes. Well-made and perfect for the occasion", "Although these shoes are beautiful, I could not wear them longer than an hour. I had to remove them at my wedding and go barefoot. They cut into toes and I had blisters from only an hour of wear.", "Hands down the most uncomfortable shoe I have ever tried on! They were so narrow and tight. I had red marks on my feet after 30 seconds of wearing them. The jewels were almost completely falling off. For how expensive they were I expected way more.", "The shoes were for my son\u2019s wedding. And while they matched my dress perfectly, the shoes lacked enough sole cushion to be worn all day. Still a beautiful shoe.", "Absolutely beautiful shoe. Lovely pink satin. Comes with an extra padding for the ball of the foot and inserts to use if they slide on the heel. Also, extra heel tips. Unfortunately, they were just too big. I have a wide foot, and these fit across the toe well. I am going to try a half size smaller.", "These shoes are Ah-mazing! I have gotten so many positive comments on how beautiful they are. The color, the quality and the comfort are superb! I did have to get a size smaller than I normally wear so watch out for that. I am wearing these for my wedding and I'm so glad i gave myself enough time to send them back and order a different size. The return was easy and I had a new pair by the next week! Highly recommended!", "I bought these for my wedding and I\u2019m so so pleased! When I ordered my gown they asked me how high my shoes were going to be because they would have the dress pre-altered to height, and I just said I was wearing 3-3 1/2\u201d heels without really thinking about it. It turns out all the typical \u201cevent\u201d shoes are made with 4\u201d heels. It was a project to find anything attractive in the right heel height range. Goodbye Badgley Mischka, hello ElegantPark! These shoes are GORGEOUS, the perfect height, and surprisingly comfortable. They even came with extra cushions/heel padding for more comfort!", "I have wide feet so I was expecting them to be a little tight, but they were actually too wide even for me. The portion that covers the toes stops short of your pad so it doesn't really hold your foot in the shoe.", "I\u2019m a 6.5 in heels but I got a 7 just to be safe than sorry. I am going to put in thicker gel pads to push my feet back a bit and replace the back \u201csticker\u201d or anti-slip thingy. I love it overall.", "I loved the shoes, beautiful color and bling. Bought in a 9 which was too large so I returned and purchased and 8, which is too small. I wish there were half sizes.", "I loved these shoes, but the color did not match well with my ivory colored dress, the shoes were more white. So I had to return. The shoes were beautiful and comfortable. I did order 1/2 size up. Don't be afraid to order.", "I had to wear these for my friend's wedding and I was in horrible pain the whole time! I hate them! They are pretty but good Lord not worth the pain! I gave them away they were so bad.", "I bought the shoes for my wedding and they are perfect! I used the sizing guide and bought the size recommended and they fit great! Can't wait to wear them on my wedding day!", "I love these shoes! I bought them to wear for my wedding, and I am very excited to wear them. They came with extra heel pads on case you need to replace them and came with nonslip pads and adhesive strips to put on the back of your heels so they don't rub. But I don't think I will have a problem with them rubbing. I was worried with some reviews saying they were cheaply made, but I don't think they look cheap at all.", "Perfect! I looked for blue shoes for my wedding for months. I kept coming back to these and they were exactly right. Everyone loved them! I did wear them around the house to break them in and they fit fine.", "I love these shoes! Since there are no half sizes I had to go up to a 7, but they aren't too big. They are supper comfortable and the perfect height. I added a comfort cushion strip to the back of the shoe for extra support and tighter fit when I walk. Size 6 would have been way too small. Overall Love these!!", "I ordered larger than I usually wear and they were still too small. Bummer as they are super cute shoes.", "I'm a 41 wide or 42. I got the 41 cause they didn't have 42 in white. It was way too narrow. Lovely style though. Truly disappointed I couldn't wear it.", "These were beautiful, my daughter wore for her wedding. They were a little large, but was fine.", "So beautiful! And it came with extra tidbits: 2nd set of plastic heel parts, self set ball of foot gel stickers, heel pads for anti blisters! I'm so pleased! Can't wait to wear these on my big day!", "Fit a little big, but looked great with my wedding dress!! I added shoe inserts to make it fit, so it worked.. very comfortable too!", "They are sooo pretty but the 11s fit like a 10! Super tight around the toes. I\u2019m so sad. They are so nice but I can\u2019t handle it. Big foot? Order size up!", "Looked like a decent made shoe & very pretty but it was too big in the heel, even with the inserts. I had to send them back", "One of the gems wasn't sewn in a way that it laid flat, but just used a tad bit of super glue, let it dry and it was perfect. My feet didn't hurt at all and I had to stand for over an hour before the ceremony stated since guests arrived early.", "Wore these for my wedding, SO happy with how they looked and I was able to wear them all night", "Not the most comfortable for my big toe but they\u2019re really pretty! I got some shoe inserts to make up for that and will be wearing them for my wedding. They do actually come with some padding inserts too.", "Even though the shoe is a little large, I don't want to return it. I recieved so many compliments on it The shoe is absolutely beautiful. I am taking it to a shoe shop to see if they can fit them to my size.", "So, these are NOT true to size. I am a regular 11 in dress shoes (I can wear a 10.5 in normal shoes/boots), and these shoes are tight as all hell. I am returning them immediately, completely dissatisfied. Well, they are very pretty, but that's it.", "Absolutely gorgeous, but they were too low of a heel for my wedding dress. I wear a 7.5 in heels, but ordered a 7. It was a perfect fit. I definitely recommend this if you want a beautiful shoe, but a low heel. They are very comfortable.", "I got these for my wedding and glittered them with modge podge. They fit perfectly and we're beautiful even before the glitter!!", "These are amazing! The color is gorgeous and perfect, the embellishments are beautiful! Plus they came with free gel inserts, heel grips, and replacement heel tips. They fit perfectly and are a super comfortable height heel. 10/10 would buy again.", "Very pretty went well with my daughter sweet 16 dress", "These fit well, but my toes were crunched. Maybe because I am a bigger girl (220 lbs) but my big toe was rubbed raw from the toe hole rubbing my skin. I only wore these for a short time before I had to take them off and figure something else out because my toe hurt so bad.", "LOVE THESE. They were beautiful for the event.

They\u2019re perfect and COMFORTABLE! They even came with sticky pads to add the comfort. The pink is pinker than I had expected but it\u2019s so cute.", "The shoes are very elegant. Worth the money. The material and quality are good. The shoes came with gel inserts for the heels and the front part, which is a nice touch. The shoes do run big so order a 1/2 size smaller. I wear 7.5 US, and I ordered these in 7. They are still loos actually but with the inserts, the shoes fit fine.", "I love these shoes they are for my wedding I have a perfect fit alil tight want the back open notice piece is loose", "Beautiful shoes and color. I\u2019m normally a 9.5 in heels but ordered a 9 after reading reviews. Feel a little too tight. Hoping the 10 is the right size because I want these as my wedding shoes!

Will need to break in a little before I wear them on my wedding day but wonderfully made, don\u2019t pinch in any areas.", "These shoes are beautiful and I cannot wait to wear them on my wedding day. The Navy Blue color is rich and jewels on the side are elegant. I was very surprised that the shoes came with Gel cushions, heel grips and heel replacements!! I definitely recommend these shoes", "This is a lovely pair of heels. As mom of the groom they have just the right amount of sparkle! They were the perfect shoe for my outfit.", "Very comfy, good quality for the money, plan to wear it on my wedding this summer. I have wide feet and it feels very comfortable", "I'm a size 6 and it is not true size. It's way too loose. Also it seems to be cheaply made. The stones are loose and looked to be sewn on after the fact and one snag would rip them off.", "Nice shoe. Too bad it way small for me. I wear an 8.5 or 9, in general, depending on brand. Have normal feet, not wide by any means. Size 9 was way too small for me. Could not even put it on at all , as the shoe is rather rigid form. Look good otherwise.", "I bought these for our nieces wedding and absolutely loved them! Very comfortable and even came with an extra set of heel bottoms and a cushion to put around the back to keep them from slipping off.", "I purchased this shoe for a wedding and it was very comfortable. The fit was good and and heal was not too high.", "Beautiful shoes. The fit was perfect, UNTIL, you have to walk in them. They slide like hell. Glad I had a back-up pair of shoes for my sons wedding.", "Very Pretty, they were a little big but they add heel grips which once in the shoe they fit fine. These are a little painful around the toe area though. Hoping they can get broken in after a few wears.", "So pretty! I really wanted these to fit but even with the heel grips, my foot kept slipping out.", "I ordered these for something different for my wedding and they are BEAUTIFUL!

Exactly what I was looking for and so budget friendly!", "havent worn them yet. They fit as expected and are pretty. Seem tight with the gel inserts so i probably won't wear them. May on the arch of foot, but not sure yet. Wedding isn't for a year. I probably should wear them to break them in a bit. Anyway they did fit.", "I love these !! They came with extra heel / ball cushion, replacement heel tips , the shoes are beautiful Toe box it great & I have fat toes !! The color of that purple is amazing", "Buckle not even attached on either shoe, sole so thin it doesn't support any weight. Can not even wear them.

I wanted something with a little bling for the special occasion.", "I\u2019m a size 7 and bought a 7 and I love them so much .. they are a little bigger than I thought they would be.

They fell within my budget and exactly the style i wanted. What you see is what you get. Shoes were the most comfortable I've worn to date.", "these shoes were not comfortable at all, nor did they fit correctly. the stones were also attached to the shoe by a chain. not the look i was going for", "LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE SHOES!!! The pics dont do them justice. They are so beautiful! I'm usually a size 8 1/2 but got the 9 after reading reviews. They fit perfect and very easy to walk in.

Wife is very happy with the quality.", "I had to return it due to my own mistake because I needed ivory and not white but otherwise it fit well and will be beautiful on the foot of the bride!", "I cannot wait to wear these shoes at my wedding! They fit perfectly. They will need to be a little stretched out as any heel does. Beautiful shoe that didn't cost a fortune!", "I purchased this in a size 10--I am normally either a 9.5 or 10 and it fits perfectly! I got it for my wedding and I am super impressed with these for an online buy. They are comfortable (which is a lot coming from me because I rarely wear heels) and they come with pads and new pegs for the bottom of the heels if they get damaged. Highly recommend! They are a bit more pink than they are in the photo, but not overpowering.", "I had to send these shoes back when I receive them they fit perfectly I just couldn't use them for what I wanted them for .", "These shoes were absolutely stunning in person. I think they got even more attention than my wedding dress! We did a walk-about-town photo shoot, and I got zero blisters or pain either. Thank you so much for making such a beautiful, affordable shoe.", "These shoes were perfect! The right color, the right fit, and they had all these extras I have never seen come in a shoe box. Very happy with this purchase and they came right on time and matched perfectly with my bouquet! Highly reccommend!", "I have wide feet so I usually just order the next size up, I did with this shoe order. Tried them on and they are small and tight and this was the largest size they had. The decoration on shoe is very loose.", "Just what I wanted for my wedding shoes. I like that it came with heel grips, heel replacement, and gel cushion.

Color was just as expected and extra ameneties for fitting were an unexpected bonus. Got so many compliments I lost track. Thank you!", "The shoes look elegant. They are gorgeous. Perfect height.

Very gorgeous and more importantly comfy. Can't wait to wear on my big day!!", "The shoe itself looks very pretty. But the sizing is completely off. The size 10 felt more like a size 9. I was really looking forward to wearing them at my wedding. I just want to save anyone else the aggravation of ordering.

I returned the first pair but they were so comfortable I tried another pair and after a week the same thing happened. I repaired them myself with some bolt on eyelets but these boots cost way to much to have a defect like this.", "I have had several keen products over my lifetime so I thought i'd buy these for my boyfriend who's a mechanic. I read several reviews and saw quite a few talking about how they tore apart. At first he wore them, liked how wide they were but didn't like how heavy they were. I never checked the weight and that's my fault. These are heavy to wear all day long. We, against our better judgement, decided to give them a try. Less than a couple months later the eyelet ripped off one of the boots. I would NOT buy these again or recommend them based on my own review and the reviews of others.", "This is my fourth or fifth pair of Milwaukees from Keen, and will be my last. The fit and finish is fine (hence the two stars), but within a month BOTH boots developed a very loud and annoying squeak when I walk. I followed all the quick fix directions on the company website FAQ to no avail. This leads me to believe it is a breakdown in the sole glue. The fact that they have a FAQ about squeaky boots is telling, isn't it? Did I mention that they've gone up in price about $50 in the last few years? Chinese junk. They'll never get another penny from me, and I can no longer recommend them to my coworkers.", "Keen had a potential winner in these boots but quality control issues make them a fail. First pair, purchased on Amazon had the speed lace eyelet pull out after 5 days. Sent them back for a replacement and the second pair had the same problem (other foot, different location) the FIRST time I laced them up. Bummer cause they are nice boots otherwise. I liked them well enough to take them to a shoe repair shop for rework.", "These well-built boots are impressive. Fit and finish is second to none and they are comfortable and supportive right out of the box. If you suffer from metatarsalgia (pain and discomfort in the upper portion of your foot) this is the perfect boot for you. Now, it is very important that you size these properly. I normally wear a size 9 in all of my Keen boots and shoes. I had to order these one full size smaller - I ordered a size 8 and they fit perfectly with my thick merino wool socks. So, please keep the sizing in mind when ordering.", "They lasted pretty well. Purchased about 2 years ago and I w them 5-7 days a week. Good: I like how wide and comfortable they are on the inside, they dont seem to get too warm. Bad: there were multiple times where one or both of the boots would develop a squeak while walking. This would sometimes last more than a week before going away. They went through 4 pairs of replacement laces. The back portion of the heel wore out very early on both boots. The front toe area coming off is why I'm needing to replace them. Its especially bad on one side. All together they did pretty well, not the best pair of boots but not bad.", "These are great work boots and my husband says they are lighter than RWs, have a deeper tread, and are super comfortable. He is on his feet all day, everyday and says his feet are as comfortable in the evening as they are in the morning. I did get him the Keen inserts a couple weeks later which he says makes the boots even better. He has even picked up the grandsons after work and played basketball wearing these boots. I highly recommend, will, he highly recommends :).", "I researched different work boots for my husband before I decided on these. Usually he has to end up with his feet hurting a lot until they are \"broke in\". He said these have been the most comfortable work boots he has ever had, from the first day he wore them. He is a plant electrician, so he is on concrete and has to keep his feet dry. These have really done a fine job of keeping his feet dry and comfortable. Definitely will get another pair when these wear out.", "These boots are build like a tank. I think that whoever is working in rough and cold conditions should take a shoot a these boots. They are heavy and they are hot. A little uncomfortable around the ankles. Some additional padding would be great. I tried the boots on with three different types of socks. Thick, cushioned socks might help with that issue. Additionally, boots feel more comfortable in general when wearing thick socks. However, they will be even hotter in that case. I have to return them because I found them some what large, but I have narrow feet. Bottom line: good boots if you are up north, plenty of cold around. .", "These keen Milwaukee boots are great iv only had them a few days so there not broken in get but so fare I like the with and the toe plenty of room but if you where a thinker sock or inserts a half size up might be a good option I have ordered keen high arch supports or then because I need that for my feet.

I\u2019m constantly walking on concrete, gravel, grating, and trucking through mud and grass. These boots fit great and I love the Keen brand. But about 3 months into wearing these I noticed the soles of both boots started tearing apart. The trad was coming off in large pieces. I\u2019ve owned these boots for 11 months now and the soles continue to tear apart piece by piece. I hope keen can fix this problem. I will not be purchasing again.", "They are a little tight around the top of my foot but I expect they will loosen up over time as they get broken in. Other than that, they are really comfortable as far as work boots go. I like that the toe isn't composite and that they are waterproof and somewhat breathable. The toe is very roomy, enough that you don't notice the steel. One thing that bothers me is that the box doesn't have any kind of marking saying that they are electrical hazard rated. Might be an issue of you work somewhere that requires proof of your safety gears certifications.", "A little over a year old and discovered a leak today. The laces barely made it 3 months before being replaced. The soles peel off in layers and have worn extremely rapidly. I really want to like the boots but they were not worth the price considering I have to replace them after a single year.", "I'm a fan of Keen, but I hate these boots. They are waterproof which is nice, but I can't wear them for more than a couple hours before my ankles are killing me! I have bruises and sores now. I thought once they were broken in a little it would get better, but I was wrong. I've tried insoles, tying the laces looser or tighter, but nothing helps. Bummer!", "Just received and overall very pleased with boots. They appear to run a bit large compared to other Keen's I have purchased but other than that zero issues. Good design and very lightweight for a work boot. Wore them all day on concrete floors with continued comfort - nice surprise to be so comfortable right out of box. So my only advice maybe get half size smaller or wear thicker socks.", "My 4th pair of Milwaukee steel toe boots. The first pair I have been unhappy about. I have worn the first three pairs apx. 9 months each and was quite happy with them. The rubber covering the steel toe on fourth pair began to tear after only 7 days of wear. The second week another tear started parallel to the first- both tears (about 1/2\" to 3/4\" in length) starting at the bottom of the front of the toe end of the boot going upwards.

And now I've realized they are NOT water proof! very dissatisfied", "So I have been wearing these boots for almost 10 months now and just noticed that my sole on the left boot is coming apart not to happy about this I paid a lot of money for the boots. I work in a casino doing building maintenance and I am not hard on my boots I would have thought that a good America made boot would have lasted me a lot longer then 10 months I hope that KEEN will do something about this but we will see.

Im on my feet all day turning wrenches and running machines these are awesome.", "Great work boot! Fairly light and a roomy toe. The only bad aspect about this boot is the rubber joint where the sole/tip rubber mates to the upper toe rubber. It seems to detach at the joint, on three pairs of Keen Milwaukees. I'm fairly hard on boots working utilities, but it seems there could be a better way to join the two surfaces to prevent separation. Other than this they are great boots.", "Best work boots ever. Comfortable and last a long time. My first pair lasted me 1.5 years. I waited too long to get a new pair but I bought two pair to make sure I had a back up set. Got them when they went on sale.", "I usually don't get too excited about boots, but when you find a brand that stands out, you have to speak out. I am in the maintenance field and needed a protected toe boot that would provide comfort as well as durability. These are ultra comfortable, from day one. No breaking in. I bought my last pair July of 2014, and decided I just wanted new boots. My older ones have been reassigned to yard duty, but are still in excellent shape.", "The boots are not very flexible. They seem like they'll last a while, but the rear of the tread on both boots is starting to come loose after 6-7 months of 40 hrs a week usage. Im not sure if I'd buy another pair of these the next time I need work boots. If I hear of other boot that's better I may try it.", "This is my second pair. My first pair are going strong after one year. I bought a second pair because of what my Grampy told me: \u201cIf you like something, buy two because at some point they will be \u2018improved\u2019 and thus ruined forever.\u201d I work for a living. These are the most durable & comfortable boots I have recently owned. They are heavy, but that is a trade-off. Prior to these, I was wearing ultra-lites that crapped out in 2 to 6 months.", "Boots arrived on time as described by seller. Fits great best work boots I've ever owned very durable and hold up well as I am hard on shoes I will be buying more from seller.", "I have purchased many pair of keen work boots over the past 8 years. This is the first pair of the milwaukee style and I am not impressed. After only 2 weeks both laces have broken in the same place due to the lace hooks. Also my left boot has a squeeking sound that has continued to get louder up to this point. With the amount spent on these boots I will not consider this to be a wise investment.", "I have trouble with my right foot. These boots have the width that allows comfort. I've been wearing them for a week and a half, they are still stiff. I hope for more flexibility as they break in. The keep my feet warm with a good pair of wool socks. I like the looks and would buy these boots again. I went a size larger but I think they are pretty true to size.", "Been wearing these for years now. They are a heavy boot but they hold up.", "Love these boots a bit heavy but over all great boots", "I walk on a lot of gravel and mud and these are durable and provide great ankle support. I\u2019ve tried Thorogood, Red Wing, Danner, and Timberland Pro. These are the best.", "They are heavier than expected. But they are tough, comfortable and can be put on and taken off quickly. The laces stay laced as long as you wear the boot.", "You should try these boots on before buying them. I have a narrow size 11 foot. I typically wear a 10.5 with Keen because they are wider than usual but did not want the steel toe to be ramming my toes/foot so I went up a size. I think that they fit a little large and have ample room in the toe box. An insert with arch support took care of the width and make these a comfy shoe right out of the box.", "They fit good.a little heavier than some ive had but I figured they would because if the heavy duty soles.mainly bought them because of the toe protector because I always wear a hole in the toe from taking a knee when working on the ground.my first pair the rubber started separating from the boot but amazon refunded them.going to give them a try anf hope the toes hold up.they are waterproof too", "I ordered these in May as a step up from the Timberlands Pros I had been using and replacing every 18 months or so for work. These cost more and were more of a reputable brand. They are far from water proof and it\u2019s he end of December and they are falling apart. Do not recommend for anything involving wetness or water. Crap.", "I have been wearing Dr. Martins for work boots until now. The toe area in the D width boot has substantially more room for toes than the Martins did. My normal shoe size is 8.5 and I wear 8 D in this boot. I did try on an 8.5 D in the store and it was too big for me. They didn't have an 8 D. The waterproof feature is great. I have flat feet so I will still be getting some aftermarket insoles but all-in-all a great all around work boot.", "I work in a brewery. And I had heard good things about these boots. The waterproofing barely lasted a month, and the soles started coming apart in a month and a half. I filed a warranty claim with Keen, and the replacements they sent me started leaking in ONE DAY. Do not buy these boots. Save your money and buy Red Wings.", "Husband loves them . He is a 10.5 and they fit perfectly...true to size. He also has wide feet and is able to wear thicker socks with these boots and still be comfortable. Very good buy!", "Keen: still the very best boots ever! I weigh 250 pounds, and pound the pavement, climb on machines, oil, grease, caustic chemicals: these boots withstand it all in comfort! The ONLY truly comfortable steel-toe boots I have ever worn: so thankful to have found out about them! Great bargain as well on Amazon...", "I\u2019ve had these boots ya for 2 years and they are still water proof. The tread has held up as well. I work in a mine and they are perfect for the environment that I work. The only downsides are they do get a bit hot (due to the waterproof aspect) and the steel toes make them a bit heavy.", "One of the most comfortable work boots I have ever used. Great for people with wide feet that work 10-14 hour days. Rubber toes are great and protect the boot well. Only wish they lasted more than a year for me.", "Wow! Whataboot! Built like an armored truck! I am the world\u2019s greatest boot destroyer and these boots feel like I could kick a hole in a tank! Oorah!", "The boot is wonderful, no braking in needed. I use heavy boot socks so I ordered 1/2 size bigger, did not need to. they are very comfortable and three other co-workers have now also gotten the same boots.", "My husband does not complain that his feet hurt from being on them all day anymore, but hes also using inserts for the first time as well with the purchase of these new boots.", "Bought them and within the first wear my feet were damp. I expect that a boot will lose its water resistance over time but not within hours. Terribly disappointed. I did submit a claim to keen and it was approved within 48 hours. I ordered another pair of keen boots but a different style, hopefully it will yield better results.", "I have been buying Keen Milwaukee since they came out. This last pair squeak so loud when I walk people keep turning around to see where the noise is coming from. Had them only 6 months. Keen will not warranty them. This is the last pair of Keen work boots I will ever buy.", "Every boot I have ever owned had something I didn't like about them. Not these boots. These boots are made for some serious WORK! I've done it all, pumped concrete for years, heavy equipment operator for years. These will outlast my DIE HARDS with epoxy toes for sure. And won't take weeks of suffering to break them in!. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!", "Product arrived and were obviously factory seconds. Soles were slip at Sean's and stitching was sub par. Returned for refund. Some things are better to buy in person.", "These are the real deal, steel toe, water proof, yet my feet don't get overly hot in them. Hands down the most comfortable boot I have ever owned. This is my 2nd pair and the amazon price was amazing, thank God for AMAZON.", "Haven't worn them that much but from what I can see they are quality boots. A touch on the heavy side and may have trouble wearing them during the hot summer days but, they are very comfortable and very well made. Def better then the last 2 pairs of American made Redwing's and the 2 Timberland pros. . Better then Timberland hyperion any day!", "THESE ARE MY FAVORITE BOOTS SO FAR. I FORGOT THEY RUN ABOUT 1 SIZE LARGER FOR MY SIZE. OVERALL I DO LOVE THEM. JUST WISH THEY WERE CLOSER TO THE SIZES OF ALL THE OTHER MANUFACTURES.", "This is my second time buying these. I abuse boots at my plumbing job and my last pair lasted 12 months. Any other boot I used to buy only lasted me 1-3 months. Besides being strong, rugged boots they are the most comfortable work boots I've ever had too. I'd seriously buy these for everyday shoes if I had a little extra money to.", "I work on a concrete floor all day. These are the only boots that don't hurt my feet by the end of the day. They fit perfect.", "So like little more than a year ago I was reading all the negative reviews about these boots and I almost didn't buy them but I I did and they have carried me through sewage, mud, broken glass, they're still holding up just fine", "Feeling pain in my feet. Even after I inserted Dr Scholl's my feet still hurt. Very heavy shoes. Not worth it.", "This is my second pair. The first pair lasted 2 years on an offshore oil rig. My only complaint is the shoe strings don't go through the tongue to help keep the tongue from moving over to the side.", "I have had several pairs of these Keen boots, all of them have fit well and have been extremely tough. They are truly waterproof and comfortable. I\u2019m really hard on my boots and these boots hold up.", "Excellent boots. They are still good after almost 2 years but, they are starting to show wear and tear. I'll be buying a new pair and donating these to Goodwill or another organization. I wear my boots all day. I don't change shoes after work and they are comfortable all day. I did add some insoles after about 8 months.", "Nice boot so far. The boots are light weight and have a good tread. The boots were very comfortable out of the box but the right boot is wearing the skin off the top arch on my foot. I need better socks. I like the fit of the steel toe box because there is a left and right toe box. Time will tell!", "These work boots are perfect for my husband who is a tile installer and on his feet all day. They hold up extremely well, this is our 2nd pair", "Husbands favorite boot. Won\u2019t wear anything else. Last pair lasted him >2 years and he wears them constantly.", "Horrible quality with the shoe laces loop holes. Broke them on my first try trying them on. I bought these boots 3 years ago but they were made in the USA. Now they are made in China, quality is not there anymore. I expected more from keens. Almost 200 dollars for cheap quality.", "Once you break them in, these are incredibly comfortable boots. Waterproofing didn't last as long as I'd hoped, but I also work with chemicals so I'm assuming that had something to do with that. Still comfortable even when wet as long as you have some nice work socks to go along with them.", "Good good work boots for wide feet. It gives me plenty of room to put a extra pair of socks on and still be comfortable all day. I would recommend buying some better inserts.", "I have been buying these same boots for 4 or 5 years now and there the best. I need to wear custom orthodics and these boots fit them perfect. If I didn't wear the soles out I could wear them for more than 2 years. Right now I go for about 11/2 years before I get a new pair, thanks keen for making the best boots.", "I\u2019ve worn boots like this for 30 years and these boots are very heavy, they dug into my shins at the top and the boot Lace hook at top of the boot came off 3 days after receiving them. I sent them back", "Love this boots. My second pair and both are extremely comfortable. And last three or more years being worn in a warehouse and in all the elements. Also enough room to wear thick socks comfortably", "This is the second pair of these I have had. Wore the first ones 5 days a week for 3 years in a construction environment. They finally started leaking from somewhere, and smelled bad, but like I said, this was after 3 years of merciless abuse. Ultra comfortable, super tough. The best boots I have worn, which is why I ordered new ones! I highly recommend these to anyone. You only have two feet, so you best take good care of them, and spend the money to keep your feet (and your back) happy, which these boots do.", "I like what I ordered but they are to big . I requested for a return on September 28th , it is now October 10th and have received nothing in the mail to return my package. If my package is not received by October 27th it looks like I'm stuck with $177 boots that don't fit . Lessened learned, buy your clothing where you can try it on first.", "My Husband said he loves really much. Lol I always hate how expensive this brand is and the last pair he got didn't last as long. I bought shoes half the price a year ago and they are still in great shape.", "We wear nothing but these . We do Hardscapes all day everyday and these boots hold up for at least a year . Noone is harder on boots than we are. We do put Kevlar laces in . Concrete dust and regular laces do not mix .

The big selling point for me, take the boots out of the box,put them on walk around about 5 minutes and there you have it there broken in.", "Comfortable but a bit tight around the ankles. Still breaking in after 2 weeks. Quite stiff as well. Built like tanks though so I'm somewhat satisfied.", "I've been wearing keens for a few years now. I needed a boot that was durable but I could also walk in for a long periods of time. These have steel toes and do not rub my feet because they're matched left and right.", "Says waterproof. But second day wearing them we had a rain storm and my my feet got wet and cold. Not happy that i spent 180.00 on boots that cant perform what theyre advertised to do.", "After a month of use they both squeak while I walk. It has become very annoying. I purchased the same pair before and never had any problems. They fit great, and are comfortable, however, the annoying sound is too much. I wish I could exchange them for new ones to see if it happens again?", "Love these boots. Highly recommend getting some thick insoles and throwing out the paper thin ones that come in the boots. I bought the Superfeet ones", "after 5+ months they still look great, they provide me good support and are comfortable. my right heal got a blister when I first started wearing them but went away after a week. my last pair of boots were trashed after 1 month... love these boots", "good boot, not to heavy, I like the eyelets, they are better than the red wings I am replacing, still breaking them in but so far I am pleased.", "My last pair of Keens. Always loved Keen work boots but never again. First new pair lost lace hook right away and water was getting in. Replacement pair have serious sweeking issues. Doesn\u2019t matter the surface so I believe it is the soles.", "These boots are the most comfortable work boots I've ever worn. They are light and feel like they are very sturdy and well made. I have nothing bad to say about these boots.", "Fit great string loop broke off on day 2 poor quality string tensioner completely broke off would not buy again", "love them i work as a cartpusher and overnight stocking team i would buy again they are a good pair of boots. the only down side is they need to have more comfort on the bottom of the boot.", "Been working on my feet wearing boots for over 20 years, these are by far the most comfortable and longest lasting boots I have ever had on my feet. Last time I purchased them which was my third pair, I bought three pairs at once fearing they would be discontinued. Five star all day long !!!", "Great boot, They arrived and I put them on,..and instantly my feel felt very happy and very comfortable. No\" break in time\" they are race ready. Nice to have a shoe that will last a long time with great comfort reliability. Don't hesitate guys, if you were thinking of getting these,... DO It! you wont be sorry. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Zappos!", "Junk lace design after 3 returns I asked for refund. Each lace hook pulled off on first time lacing up", "I landscape and these boots are the only ones I'll ever buy. They last about a season and a half, which is pretty good for how much abuse I give them. Love the wide toe, and the cushion. Can't go wrong.", "Comfortable, but only lasted 5 months before the stitches started to come apart. Now the sides are blown out. Not worth what I paid.", "Great boots! I bought these boots for my boyfriend and my roommate and they both love them. They said they were extremely comfortable and not too heavy. The pair I got for my boyfriend I purchased 3 years ago and they still look brand new.", "Great ass kickin boots. Work the s*** out of these and they hold up to the construction industry. Wide front for my fat feet. Love them. Industrial looking too.", "I bought a size larger than normal because I read many reviews on amazon that stated that the boots were on the smaller size. The first day I wore them my left foot was killing me from where the boot would bend at the toes when walking. The next day I put inserts in the boots from my old work boot and it made a huge difference super comfortable have no issues with the boots.", "Eyelets ripped out after third day poor. Keen know its a problem wont do much to fix it though", "I love these boots it's my second pair. Had to call Keen to confirm that I didn't need a wide. These are a WIDE work boot and fit my \"hobbit feet\" just fine in a medium width. For my feet it still takes a good week of break-in after dousing in boot oil liberally. Love these boots because they are super rugged llast pair lasted nearly 2 years and that is amazing in my work.", "went 2 lace up my boot first dat and the hook broke off 4 the lace. not my first pair of keen boots, kinda bummed it didn't work", "Love these boots. Sadly one of the upper lace loops broke off soon after purchasing. A replacement was sent without issue. Unfortunately the same thing has occurred once again and I'm now outside the return window. The broken loop makes it difficult to lace up and affects the amount of support the highback gives during use. Otherwise an amazing boot! :(", "Had to return these boots. The traction was poor on metal floors", "the boots are holding up well and hit the standard I have come to expect from Keen.", "Only a 4-star rating at this point because I'm still trying to justify the price. That will be determined later if they hold up.. Just having them for a month now I am very happy I just hope for the price I will have them for a very long time and they maintain their comfort", "I've been wearing work boots for 30 + years these are the most comfortable out of the box boots. Almost no break in time.", "Perfect best boots i have ever owned. The only problem it the insoles need to be better", "My hubby has the shoes, and loves them. The boots are are just as comfortable, and keep his feet dry as a bone. Great footware, we will be buying again.", "Really Nice boots. a little stiff at the moment. but once they break in they will be perfect.", "Bought these because the pair of weekend lowtop hikers I bought a couple years ago have held up extremely well. The sole wore out before the waterproofing did and there was no separation of the sole, toe, etc. After a couple months of use, these work boots have begun to fail already. The waterproofing on the right foot is shot. Right foot was soaked just walking through dewy grass! The left foot also has wet spots on either side of the steel toe. The sole has also started to separate where the rubber meets the dense foam (glue) on both. Am getting ready to contact Keen regarding these issues and will edit when addressed.", "Shoes are heavy duty, look to much like Steelers colors though, yuck! Get the brown.", "Best work boot I have ever owned in 20 years of hvac service. Perfect for rooftop HVAC work in just about all weather.

They are water proof this way you can get in a little bit of water and not have to worry about your socks getting wet.", "Great utility boot - looks good, nothing much to complain about", "So far a great boot. Stiff the first few days. Glad I got the EE.. I also got them half size smaller. I have flat feet so the added width makes them comfy. I also like to wear a thick sock with a wool blend. Working in a machine shop, I'm interested to see how the Keen toe holds up. Thinking of buying another pair to rotate every other day to help keep the moisture out.", "Comfortable. Definately room for an extra insert, and be forewarned waterproof means these boots do not breathe at all. Great boots so far. Highly recommend.", "These are so comfortable and protect my husbands feet. My husband hasn't had good circulation in his feet for years and I can trust his precious feet to these shoes.", "I wear my boots for 9 hours a day, 5 days week, so comfort is paramount. These boots are proving to be comfortable, but we'll see how they hold up in the long run.", "These are my third pair of KEEN boots and I've been very pleased with each one. The stiff construction makes for a stable and confident feel.", "I have already logged 75 miles of working steps in these boots. Wow my feet Jane never been happier. Great boots.", "These boots are sick! I love them. For about 7 years I struggled with a paid of Timberland Pro steel toe boots. They just did not fit my wide feet. The soles finally fell apart a few weeks ago and Timberland customer support was completely unresponsive. So I upgraded to these Keen boots. They are amazingly comfortable. The only negative so far is the big blubbery toe cap is fairly heavy. Not a huge deal and I would rather have the protection for toe wear, but definitely noticeable over my old boots. Still I would take these any day over any boot I have ever put on my feet. They are that comfy.", "Good quality boot! Takes s couple days to break in but that's to be expected. I'm on my feet 8+ hours a day in damp and cold conditions. I found these boots very Comfortable and lighter than expected and they keep my feet warm and dry, Well worth the money. Hoping these last me longer than 6 months like my last pair of work boots (Not Keen)...we'll see.", "These boots fit my foot okay, but they rubbed against my shin to the point of busing. I tried to give them a couple of days to see if they would work, but in the end I just had to send them back as I could not wear them.", "Good quality and very comfortable. We shall see how the soles and heels wear. In my experience, Keen insoles are not the most durable.", "Great boot for the money. I'm hard on boots and surprised how well they are holding up.", "My husband uses this brand of work boot they seem to hold up well & are comfortable.", "Fit is good. I normally wear a 12 wide. I read they run a little big, so I ordered 11.5 wide. Fit was correct.", "On my feet eight hours in the MN cold, these boots have my toes sweating! May have to get a different boot for Summer wear.", "very happy with these boots. all day comfortable and I actually did not want to take them off! I hope they will last.", "The best thing about these boots is they are just like the rest of keens shoes comfortable and dry.

My first pair lasted over a year. I've made a living standing on concrete for more than 25 years. I have worn Sears Die Hard, Caterpillar, Wolverine, Red Wing, and Timberland work boots over the years. I can honestly say these Keen boots have been the most comfortable I have owned. I was a Timberland man for probably the past 10 years but these Keens are much lighter and just as durable at a similar price point. I gave these a try on the suggestion from a co-worker, I'm glad I did. As long as Keen keeps up this quality I'll retire in a pair of these boots.", "Got these for my husband, who is an armed guard.

They just get more & more comfortable as goes by.", "They claim the boot is EE wide but the width is something that is hard to determine just by trying them on, you have to wear them for a little while before you can determine if the tightness is because they are new, or because they are to narrow. I thought the boots were going to work out but after wearing them a little while I realize they were to narrow and felt more like a single E. Of course, by wearing them even for a day means I cannot return them, and I have purchased another pair of boots online that I cannot wear or return.", "Great boots 2 year's of use on my first pair", "Very stiff to break in.

I normaly buy red wings I'm on my feet all day and over 300 lb not a lot of boots hold up to that.", "These are the most comfortable workboots I have ever worn.", "Great boot, I just got them, but I can tell they are gonna wear like iron. Very comfortable for such a heavy and substantial boot. I would recommend. \u2022 Brad", "As others have said these are solid, heavy boots, that's fine but unfortunately the back of the boot is very hard and rubs the back of my heel raw. I will try some heel liners to see if that fixes the problem.", "Takes a few days to break them in but so far all is good", "Good boot for Gardner we walk all day and aren't bad environment for any kind of boots but these lasted me the longest and are comfortable I recommend them.", "My husband had worn the tread off the bottom of his old boots. Decided to look at a few high end (for us, anyway) boots. These seemed to be the closest to what he needed. He fainted at the price when I ordered them. But now that he's received them and worn them for a few days, he couldn't be happier.", "The most comfortable boots I have owed. I have tried all the big brands and nothing compares to keen", "have to wear in increments to break in, but good.", "I have a pair similar to this that are soft toe and are very comfortable. I needed a pair of steel toe boots for my new job so I decided to go with a brand that I already knew. Rugged, comfortable and durable pair of boots.", "Theses boots fit as I expected with a wide toe box. I added insoles to take up some of the room and feel they fit better now. The boots are comfortable and seem rugged but only time will tell", "These boots fit well and are comfortable to wear on concrete but are not very easy to put on my feet because the loop that I am used to using to pull them around my heel is not on these boots,So I have taken the laces off the third hook to aid in putting them on.4 months old the midsole (plate under sole) broke, every time kneel down they pop.now they leak", "So far so good. Only been a week. Had to get used to the big toe. Very comfortable with some extra foot pads.", "This is probably the \"best\" work boot I have purchased over the course of 10+ years. It's light in weight; The first use my feet weren't soar; Overall great!", "The boots are rugged and perfect for what I bought them for. The last pair of boots I had looked very bad on and around the steel toe which is why I chose these. The toe caps are very rugged and robust.", "The hardware broke tying them the first time. Very disappointed.", "These boots are awesome, burly and they fit pretty true to size for me! I love em'.", "They fit true to size and feel great but unfortunately there was a small 1/4\" chunk of the sole where it meets up with the toe that was missing, found the piece they tried to glue in the hole laying inside box. this does not inspire confidence in Keen if they would try to pass these off as OK for sale. I've returned them and hoping replacements look better.", "I've had this boot for a few months now and they fit great, are comfortable and hold up well. I would recommend this boot and will be buying this pair again for work when they wear out.", "This is my 3rd pair of therse boot. I love them.", "I have been doing utility work for 28 yrs. I have had every brand of boot out there. These are the best I have ever had. Keen is now the only brand I will ever buy.", "Great boots for the jobsite. Good traction on roof, and actually water resistant. Laces did break quickly though.", "So far so good, have worn them for one week. Comfortable fit for new shoes. We will have to see how they hold up.", "You get what you pay for when it comes to work boots ! Very well made boot , a little heavy but definitely a quality product !", "The fit wasn't what I expected and the laces broke a short time after purchase.", "I've always been impressed with Keen's work boots and this is the second pair I've owned in three years.", "boots are heavy and not as comfortable as I I thought they would be plus they make my feet sweat. I work indoors as a forklift driver so I don't do that much walking but the little I do they are hurting my heel so far I'm hoping they will get better over time. They only reason I bought them is because I love the sandals I have", "so far so good. Time will tell. Need to put more mileage on them and then I'll know", "I'm at my second keen work boots and they've been great with my feet", "inner sole are very thin had to replace then on the 2nd month", "Had to break them in a little. But now a awesome work boot will be buying another in near future.", "needed additional arch support but I am an old guy with plantar faschiaitus", "Very good boot we will see how long they hold up. Let you know.", "This is my second pair and I expect that they will be just as comfortable as the first pair.", "I haven't had a chance to wear these boots yet, but my initial reaction is of a well made boot. The biggest concern that I have is the metal shoelace hooks, I don't know how the laces will hold up- I guess that's what new laces are for.", "I have extremely wide feet, the keen wide toe box is the best thing ever! the toe bumper is great too because I've worn through the leather on the toes of every pair I've owned.", "These boots feel great! I work in Afghanistan so, I'm in them on average for about 14 Hours a day! I don't wear them everyday.....I rotate them with the Keen Atlanta Lowfers.....and their comfortable too but These boots feel outstanding! Just to get jiggy with it.....I'm gonna put another pair of insoles in them for added softness in these boots and in my low cut Keens! Its definitely not needed but I just want that edge! Good durable boot!", "There good so far just seem a little heavy at the end of a long day.", "There is a little heavy other than that very comfortable high-quality materials", "Once again. Keen can't figure out their size chart. Returned the boots.", "This is my 2nd pair of keen boots and I love them! I work in the construction business and I wore every construction boot u can think of and none as comfortable and durable as this brand..", "Not my first pair of these boots although my last were brown. Every other pair of workbooks I've purchased lasted about 2 years before needing replacement, these gave me a good run for four years. As long as they keep making these I will buy them.", "I have worn KEEN work boots for quite some time now and have loved every pair until I got these. I always bought the Tacoma style till they were discontinued and tried these. Very little support and not as good of a foot bed as the Tacoma had. They also took a week just to wear in the top of toe covering so it wasn't digging into my foot. Definitely wont be buying these again!", "This is my 2 pair excellent boots , they hold up great on blacktop.", "I used these boots for a total of 6 working months and they fell apart, See the posted pictures.

I sent them back.", "So far so good ....i haven't had them long enough to really give my opinion but they look and feel great", "appeared to be good, but a bit narrower, and shorter, than my other brands of boots.

Had to return them....", "This is a steel toe boots But it doesn't say that in Features", "Nice looking, well made boots.

I was so skeptical that these boots would be comfortable. I wear a 6.5 and purchased a 6 and they fit great! The material is bendable and I don't feel like I'm wearing rain boots at all! Now I have to decide what color I'm getting next!!", "Love these boots! Very comfortable and durable. I normally wear an 8 and bought a 7 in these. I can still wear them with socks, but my toe is at the end. I just didn\u2019t want my foot sliding around.", "I now know what all the fuss is about these boots! First, my calf size is about 16\" and there is enough room for going to about 17.5\" comfortably. Once you get that situated, you will have a fantastic boot. I wear them in the snow and/or low temps with a thick wool sock with no issues. With other winter boots I used to change when I got inside but because I'm in a casual work environment I've enjoyed wearing them all day. They quickly become a part of you.", "I normally wear a 9.5 or 10 and the 9 fits perfectly. Normally I can't wear a 9 in most shoes, it would be too tight, but the 9 is perfect even with thick socks", "I purchased these in a size 8 (I\u2019m a 7.5) and I definitely could have gone with a 7! The quality is so nice and they were perfect. But unfortunately I have to return them as they don\u2019t fit in the calves. I have around 18 inch calves, so they fit mostly but they bunched up around the bottom toward my ankles \ud83d\ude15 I\u2019m thinking about giving them one more day, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll fit. Super cute though! So bummed they don\u2019t make the huntress boots anymore!!", "I sized down to a 7, although I\u2019m normally a 7.5, and even with a thickish sock (100% cotton ankle sock), it feels great and is super cute! I ordered the adjustable back because my calf is around 14.5 inches (normally 15 but that\u2019s the only part of my body that is currently losing weight-.-) and I want to stuff my jeans in the boot as well. I don\u2019t think they will provide much insulation once it drops into the lower 30s, but will be great for fall and dog walking. Like this comment if you agree: if there is a mud puddle, our pups will find it. *conspiracy theory :D", "Bought them about 2 years ago and they are already ripping apart on my wife. You\u2019re better off buying directly from Hunter so that you\u2019re covered under warranty. I tried contacting the seller and no response for weeks... hope this helps you understand what you\u2019re getting into, fellow consumers!", "Love these boots! I read a lot of reviews before ordering, and glad I did. I wear a size 7.5 sometimes 8 depending on the shoe, and bought a 7 after reading they run large. I have wide feet, and \"soccer girl calves\" that hardly ever fit in tall boots. These fit me perfectly! Love the color, and they work for rain and snow! Super happy with them :) I hope to have them a very long time!", "I usually wear between a 5-6 shoe and I ordered a 6 so I could have room to use the Hunter sock insert. They fit great. They are lighter then I thought too.", "I boutght these to use at my zookeeping job as I live in a very rainy area and get wet constantly during the day. I used these four days a week for three months until they completely broke apart. These boots are not equipped to handle heavy walking for long periods of time!!!! I thought they might handle the use since this is a reputable brand but these are definitely not meant to be used for any type of work.", "I have very wide calves so I was worried these wouldn't fit but they do. They are somewhat baggie in the ankle area and the foot are is what I was really worried about. I wear an 8 WW and have trouble finding shoes that fit. These are downright roomy in the foot. If you are short like me you will have to be ok with them hitting the backs of your thighs as you walk up stairs - that clunkiness will take getting used to. I am 5'2", "Wanted to love these for the price, they were $60 less than my old Hunters (ordered directly from there website) but after just 3 wears the back adjustable strap ripped off. I wasn\u2019t even adjusting it, just noticed something was rubbing on my leg while I was wearing them and I looked down and saw the strap broken : ( I don\u2019t think these are authentic...just seemed cheap!", "Love these! If you have a wider calf these are a must! My calves are a bit too wide for the regular tall boots (I want to wear jeans or a warm boot sock with them!) and the wide leg boots were just way too big. These are perfect. I can adjust them smaller if I just wear a legging and readjust for a thicker boot sock over skinny jeans, etc. I am short and they do come up to right under my knee so if that would bother you then I would go with the shorter boot. I use these for everything, from shoveling snow to working in the yard. Highly recommend!", "These boots are great for rain and snow. I got off brand inserts for cold weather and wore them all winter. They are the perfect height up my calf so that the water which flicks up from the bottom of your shoe doesn't get onto my pants. They are sturdy, but easy to walk in. The boots look and feel quality made and will last a long time. I highly recommend these boots for anyone.", "Gift for my girlfriend. She loved them. Got her the socks as well. They look great on her. I see some reviews about people having these boots and the color started to fade. She had them for a few months and has used them a few dozen time in snow and rain. She says her feet stay warm. They boots still look brand new. They seem like grea quality to me", "I am disappointed with the boots I received. The rubber coating is peeling off after 1/2 day in the office. The front of the boot mold is off centered. I\u2019m disappointed, I would expect this from a low end retailer, not from the hunter brand.", "DO NOT BUY HUNTER BOOTS FROM THI SELLER - They are not an authorized seller of Hunter. Bought a pair that fell apart after one month - they won\u2019t replace and when I was referred to Hunter I was told I have no recourse due to them not being an authorized seller. Now I have spent a hundred dollars on defective boots that apparently may not even really be Hunter. This seller will not do anything for me.", "Overall, very happy with the product. Can't really comment on them too much ... They do what they're intended to do and keep my feet dry. I will say, they do freeze your feet in the winter. Highly recommend thick wool socks or boot liners if you're purchasing them for the snow. The plastic will turn into an ice box quickly and you won't feel your toes after 10-15 minutes with just ordinary socks. Also, make sure you get the boots for wide calf. I ordered the kind without the adjustable strap prior to these ones and had to send them back because they were too tight (I've NEVER had to order wide-calf boots before).", "For such a high price I would expect better. I use these in the rain and mud as well as on a variety of terrains and the traction became absolutely terrible after about a month of wear. I slip and fall in these boots at least once per week, which never happened in cheaper rain boots with far better traction. These boots are also riddled with holes and cracks, rendering them no longer waterproof, after only 4 months.", "I\u2019m a bigger girl with big calves. Finally able to wear some Hunter boots. Of course the original thin calf style on some thin calves would be even nicer. But seeing as that is not currently an option - I love these boots. They are high... they hit just below my knee. I am fine with it but I am 5\u20198\u201d tall... I could see this style being uncomfortable on a shorter person. I usually have the opposite problem - so I like the height for once. Run pretty true to size.", "I am usually a 7.5 in regular shoes and I knew size 8 Hunter boots were too large, due to previously trying some on. These 7s fit great, even with the thick wool liner socks. Purchased separately. I maybe wouldn\u2019t need the expanding back, but having a little calf room is nice. The fold over Hunter liner socks fits over the expander fastener. I wore these boots in Minnesota, with 30\u00b0 weather, and with the wool liner socks my feet felt fine! I wouldn\u2019t use these as long term snow boots or for extended outdoor adventures, but they work well for running around town.", "I'm glad I read the reviews so I'd know how to size! I wear a 7.5 and a size 7 is plenty generous for wearing with thick socks. My always pay close attention to reviews re: calf size. Mine are 14.5 inches, which is just on the cusp of many boot shaft sizes. I thought I could get away with these and still have room for cute boot cuffs. Alas, the cuffs make my boots way too tight. So I have to wear the boots without cuffs. Next time I'll get the adjustable boots!", "Nice boot, fits nicely. But once you try to remove it, due to the tight ankle area, there\u2019s intense suction that prevents me from taking the boot off without the help of my husband. I thought about drilling a hole in the toe area to get air into the boot but that would defeat the purpose for which I bought it, to keep my feet dry during rainy weather. So now the boots just sits in my closet as a decoration! Has anyone else had this problem?", "The boots are beautiful. They fit great around my calfs (15inch). The belt is a little difficult to adjust. It fits well around my toes. The width is perfect when wearing the hunter socks. My only issue is that the heel felt uncomfortable. When walking I can feel the rubber around my heel jabbing at my foot. Not sure how to solve that issue. Which is why I rated it 1 star. Other than that the boot are good.", "So, I wanted to buy these boots since a long time ago as these can't be bought in Ecuador. -I was worried about the size but it really fits perfect. I usually wear a size 6 and bought the same size and it fits perfectly. The hard part is to take off the boots at the end of the day, but it is not impossible. My height is 1.54 and the large of the boots is okay for me. The get right under my knee and don't bother me at all. And they do not make my calfs feel tight at all. Overalll these boots are perfect and I will definitely get my green ones soon :)", "I absolutely love the way these boots look and feel. But I really should have listened to the comments suggesting if you have wider feet that you should size up. But instead I size down like all the other comments, so I had to return and order a larger size and i'm glad I did. I actually prefer a little wiggle room with my boots so that I can wear thicker socks. I ordered a size 7 and I normally wear a 6.5", "I'm usually a 9/9.5 and the 9 is pretty large. Nice for wearing big comfy socks though. One thing is that the boots are really high and the adjustment is at the back, so if you're like me and sit cross-legged all the time, it can be a bit awkward.", "I can tell these will keep my feet dry and easy to clean after working with the pigs. Can still wear them for winter. I was going to buy cheaper ones but think these will hold up better. They are a bit tall in the back for kneeling down. Uncomfortable hitting the back of my knees- I\u2019m 5\u201d5\u201d.", "With an upcoming trip to Colorado I really wanted some cute boots to wear on outings that didn\u2019t require snow boots. These were 100% perfect! I ordered the wide calf size 10 with the adjustable back and they\u2019re great. I usually wear a 9 1/2 and 10 and went with the size 10. I layered them with a set of boot socks and leggings! My feet stayed dry, warm and cute the whole trip! I\u2019m headed to NYC and I can\u2019t wait to wear them again!", "The width is great at the top of the calf but it\u2019s super tight at the base of the calf which means I can\u2019t really wear them. I don\u2019t understand why the entire shaft isn\u2019t wide. And since it\u2019s not adjustable, there isn\u2019t a way to make it work.", "Of course Hunter Wellies are meant to be Great. Unfortunately if you do more than go to the mall or wear them once a week when it happened to rain, they will not last. After less than 2 months they were cracked and leaking. Not much more to say aside from them being crap. Look elsewhere if you are expecting to have a somewhat fansionable boot that would last with any type of real use.", "Finally Hunter boots that give me room in the calf! I am by no means large nor do I have large calves. They are athletic from years of being active but I\u2019ve never actually had to buy wide calf boots before. I highly recommend the back adjustable...I cinched them up and buckled them with about 1 inch to spare around my calf. I also ordered Hunter\u2019s Original Tall Wide Calf and while it fit around the calf (just barely, no extra room), it was huge around my ankle. I will be sending those back and keeping the back adjustable.", "Thrilled with the ORIGINAL AUTHENTIC Hunter Boots. They came in the beautiful HUNTER BOX with care card instructions included. Hunter Customer Service # in England. There is a teeny tag inside that says \u201cMade in Indonesia\u201d- which is fine. And last 5 star comment was the incredible price. Thank you-Amazon...Thank you Hunter Boots.", "My daughter wears size 10.5 but based on reviews I ordered a 10 for her. This is also too big so will need to order 9 now. Would have given a higher rating because the quality does appear good. Update- we returned the 10.5 and bought the 9.5 which fits her perfectly. They are really good since the barn is really mucky to walk in and these do not slip. The return process for the previous shoes was very convenient. I highly recommend this seller.", "I ordered my exact size 9. A screen popped up saying to order size 10 twice. They would have been tremendous on me. Size 9 is a perfect fit. Last year, I bought my daughter a size 10 (her actual size) perfect fit. I love the boots. Going to Ireland so I need rain boots. These are perfect and in style.", "I have wanted these boots forever! It seemed extravagant to pay this much for rain boots but now that I have them, it\u2019s not!! I wear them all the time! Today I actually had to go into water almost a foot deep to help my dog out of a sticky situation and I came away completely try! The toe box is roomy but I like that, I can layer when needed and breathe when I don\u2019t! These boots are also not bulky. I ordered muck boots initially and sent them back as I could barely walk. Order these! You won\u2019t regret it!", "I had read that they run a 1/2 size larger. What I found is that I always wear a US 7. Yes these are a little roomy in the foot BUT I have high arches, so getting in and out of boots with the little extra foot room is perfect. I can wear with or without socks The quality of the boot is wonderfully made and very soft and pliable. They are perfect.", "I absolutely love these boots! I don't normally spend this much on my footwear, but these are so comfortable that I can wear them running errands all day and still be comfortable. They go with everything and make leggings look way cuter! They are so well-made and will last for years, no doubt. I wear a 9 and bought an 8 and they fit perfectly!!", "Really comfortable for walking. Perfect fit, doesn't slip around. Allows for a medium weight wool sock. If you like heavy thick socks, go a 1/2 size up. After several of years of trying cheap imitations I spent the money and wish I would have bought this before.", "These boot are fantastic! They\u2019re true to size/width and are super comfortable to wear. They also have a strap for adjusting the calf size of your boot. My calves are pretty thin, so I really appreciate being able to tighten the strap for a less floppy fit. They are super durable too and cleaning them is just a hose-squirt away! Love these! =D", "Do not buy. I returned these boots bc I could not even get my foot all the way down to the foot part bc the neck of the boot is extremely tight. I was really disappointed bc I really liked the look of the boot", "I am 5'7\" and these boots come up the just below my knees. In my option, they are a little to tall. Considering how expensive they are, I am happy to say they have grown on me and I'm just happy I have something to keep my feet dry.", "I love these boots. They're sleek and comfortable (as rain boots go). They look great on and go with almost anything. I've worn them with jeans, leggings and even skirts. It took me a while (and several pairs of cheaper boots) to work up the courage to invest, but I'm glad I did. They live up the hype and the price.", "Perfect boot, excellent quality. Already had a pair in the hunter green. Bought a second pair in black. Love them! I love the adjustable back. I found the regular was just a smidge too tight for me (I don't have overly wide calves), so I was happy to find they made an adjustable version. So happy with them. They are comfy and keep your feet/legs warm and dry.", "This is my first pair of Hunters and I hadn't tried on at a store prior or anything. These are way heavier than I expected them to be. They are well constructed. The way the shoe is constructed you don't have a natural foot gait for comfortable walking but these are stylish and functional. Not sure I would spend this much on rainboots again, maybe I will go for the smaller boot in the future.", "I have short, wide, trianglur feet, so it\u2019s immensely difficult for me to find shoes that fit. I was worried, when someone had told me these fit narrow, and was thrilled to discover that they were incorrect. These fit my weird little feet perfectly, and that is a huge deal. These boots are a sturdy, well made classic, a must have for every shoe lover\u2019s collection. Five stars.", "Love these adjustable boots. I don\u2019t have large calves, but the original fit were too snug. Wouldn\u2019t be able to tuck pants into them. These adjustable\u2019s are great. Plenty of room for tuckage. Surprised at how comfy they are. I wear a fairly thick knee sock with them and there\u2019s plenty of room in the foot bed.", "Well made, sturdy boots. Nice comfy inside lining. I bought these for Alaska trip at end of May, so they have not really been put to the test yet. I was pleased that they did not floor around on my foot like many do. I have a narrow foot, and just trying on and walking around the house, I think these will be perfect. I hope so.", "I LOVE MY BOOTS!!! This seller is amazing!!! I got my boots within days of placing my order (and I do not have prime), the price was the BEST out there and I have been wanting a pair of these boots forever but I ride horses so my calf is huge and I could never fit into the regular HUNTER boots until I found these. I am an 8-8.5 depending on the cut so after reading other reviews I ended up going with a 9 and they fit beautifully! LOVE LOVE LOVE my boots and this seller is AWESOME!", "Was a gift for my grand daughter and she loves them. She wears an 8 1/2 shoe so I ordered a 9. They are tighter than normal thru the ankle area and hard for her to get on, but are fine once she gets them on. I marked they were somewhat small above based on the tight ankle area and since she actually wears a 1/2 size smaller, I don't know if the actual foot runs small or not", "This was tight on the calves and weirdly loose on the area between the ankle and calves. Yes, I even adjusted the belt behind the boot. It looked really cute, but just not for me. I am 5'3\" and my calves measured 16.5\" in circumference. This is my 2nd purchase and I had to return the 1st one.", "Absolutely love these boots. I\u2019m glad I researched the sizing on the hunter website. In purchased a size 8 and am normally an 8.5. I have slightly muscular calfs and I read the originals can be a snug fit so I\u2019m very glad I purchased the ones with the adjustable back. These fit perfect with jeans or leggings. It\u2019s a little more snug with the hunter socks but nothing crazy.", "I ordered new matte black boots with an adjustable back (as advertised). Instead, I got scuffed up boots in the wrong color and style. Make sure you don\u2019t buy from a 3rd party. Zero quality control. Needed these boots ASAP and now I\u2019m SOL. Stuck waiting 3-5 business days for my money \ud83d\ude44 Don\u2019t be like me- pay the extra money and get them straight from Hunter.com", "I normally wear a 7.5 in shoes and based on some of the reviews I got a 7 in these boots. They fit my foot fine, however, they are pretty tight on my calves. I bought the adjustable back ones specifically because they are wider o the calf so I don\u2019t think I have many other options. I guess I just have really fat calves. I still like them and they do the job. They are still cute.", "I wanted to love these boots, but they calf just wasn't wide enough at the top and made them look all bunched up. I guess I'll have to find another brand that fits right.", "I\u2019ve had these boots a little over 1.5 years. They are splitting! I\u2019ve contacted premium brand outlets about the warranty twice and have NOT received a response. So disappointed I paid over $100 and they are not lasting.", "Bought in February, wore for the first time today and strap on back broke off. Only wore them in the car and to get out.. and of course my return window is closed.. such a bummer", "They are super comfy and I love how tall they are. Also love the adjustable strap but unfortunately this is also why I am giving it 2 stars. I have had these for a week and have only worn them 3 times and the adjustable strap on the left boot broke!! I don\u2019t know if this is a recurring problem with this style or if I just unfortunately got a defective pair, but kind of makes me wish I got the regular ones without the adjustable straps.", "Without half sizes, i went up a half size and it\u2019s really big. I should have gone down by half. They\u2019re really cute!", "These boots are perfect for wearing during rain or damp weather. They fit beautifully and look great. I bought these boots in black after enjoying another pair in a different color. Hunter is a very high quality brand and these boots are super comfy.", "After less than two years, and extreme care of my boots, they are cracking and peeling. I only bring them out when it's raining and they spend all the dry months inside. Super disappointed.", "The adjustable buckle makes it easy to remove the boots especially if you have wider calves. I can also wear heavy boot liners and not have an issue. They are very waterproof and have a pretty rugged sole. The finish on the boot is not real smooth, would not describe them as being fashionable. I wanted a tall boot I can wear in rain and snow and these fit the bill.", "I love these boots! I live in the PNW and really needed a high quality rain boot, and something that is easy to slip on and off. I wear a size 8 to 8 1/2 and the size 8 fits great, with all types of socks. They are also extremely cute, and can be dressed up a bit. They are perfectly water-proof and I like the Navy as an alternative to black. The adjustable buckle for the calf is also very helpful, particularly if you are wearing leggings vs. jeans. These are really comfortable boots, and I'd recommend also pairing these with the shearling insoles for added comfort and warmth.", "I would give these boots 5 stars if they fit. Such a well made boot, beautiful, stylish, classic. I love them. I had such high hopes after reading the reviews but they were no match for my short legs and wide calves. Standing a tall 5\u2019 2\u201d it is not easy to find boots that fit. I am going to try ordering the Short Adjustable boot made by Hunter.", "I wear an 8 and bought an 8 and they seemed somewhat tight and difficult to get off. My bigger issue was the adjustable strap. It is so cheaply made that someone like me who wants tthe strap as tight as possible can\u2019t tighten it. Plus the strap looks like it\u2019s one wear away from just snapping off and breaking. Returning and trying a different style.", "my fiance\u0301 is a size 7-7.5 and we got her the 7. She has thick calves and needed the 'back' buckle instead of the other hunter's with the side buckle. This extremely helped her out as she was able to adjust to her fit. The boots fits perfect and snug on her. She tried it on with jeans and layered a long sock as well and the fit was perfect. she walked around and advised that it was lightweight and overall happy with the purchase. also id' like to add that shipping came extremely faster than what was predicted when it would arrive.", "These little look nice but for something so expensive, you would expect them to have some kind of support. This is just the bare basics. I\u2019d ordered a $26 pair of rain booties that at least came with an insole. And while I have not worn my Jules in a while, I certainly don\u2019t recall the support being zero.", "I originally ordered the regular hunter boots off of their site at Christmas time but couldn't even get my leg in so after reading these reviews about the backstrap I was super stoked! I got them today and they are really cute!", "I love these boots. They fit well- a little big, but room for a thick sock. I do wear them a lot, but within 11 months both boots have cracked and leak at the ankle. For the price I did not expect that. $20 boots from Walmart lasted longer.", "I bought two of these hunter boots in a 10 and 11. 10 was too small (with their boot socks) and the 11 was too big. wish there was a 1/2 size to try.", "I mean they are pretty much $10 runber boots with a Hunter label. I haven't decided if I'm returning them or not. They are also a little awkward to walk in. Definitely not the most comfortable boots. I've had Walmart boots more comfortable.", "These boots were exactly what I wanted, unfortunately I am only 5\u20193\u201d, and the height was uncomfortable and made it difficult to remove the boot. I returned for the shorter boot, and hope they meet my need.", "Best boots I've ever owned! I seriously have worn these almost every day this winter. I love them so much! They're comfy to wear all day also. I got a size 8 because I normally wear a 7.5, but they don't do half sizes. You wont be disappointed though by going up a half size...", "I bought these for my daughter who lives in Washington state and REALLY needs them! She texted me that she loves them and they will be just perfect with socks size wise. She was so happy she sent me a before and after with her old boots!", "Super fast shipping, got them in two days!! Great price $85 dollars is a steal of a deal, these are great fitting and true to size I wear a 9 and got a 9.", "Love these boots! Look great, roomy enough for big socks or boot socks but not too roomy without. Love the buckle for adjusting for bigger calves. Mine are 15-15.5 inches or so and these open up fashionably to allow up to 17 inches around. I want a green pair SO BAD but they have no 8s in that color \ud83d\ude2d I\u2019m gonna live in these! Already wore them out to the pumpkin patch and plan to wear them for the rainy week ahead! Best rain boots I\u2019ve purchased.", "Love these hunters! They fit great and the adjustable back is perfect for wider calf\u2019s! My previous pair were the huntress shorter ones because of my side calf\u2019s! I was so excited to be able to get the talls!", "I thought I would love them but i had no idea how much. They are a staple item and sit by my door. I run outside in any condition. Used in rain, snow, mud. They are durable and quite difficult to damage. Worth the cost.", "These don\u2019t feel clunky at all! The adjustable strap is so wonderful for my large calves.", "I ordered these boots 1/2 size more than what I usually wear because I wanted to wear them with extra heavy socks and they are perfect. I usually wear 7-7.5 and I have another pair that are size 6, tho they fit, there is no room for anything other than a thin sock.", "They would have been really cute if only my calves weren't 17 in, it would probably be ok if you had 16 in calves or smaller. I can get them on but they look silly as you can see in the picture. Looks like I will have to find a different kind of rain boot. The quality of the boots appears to be very nice though.", "Great, comfortable fit and stylish enough for me to wear at work. I have received a lot of compliments. The clasps is very classy looking and it adjusts perfectly for those of us with larger calves. I've had no problem stuffing my pants in them.", "Great quality, I ordered a nine because I typically wear an 8 1/2 to a nine and they\u2019re slightly big. But good for heavy socks. Plenty of room in the calf area and I have medium sized calves.", "These boots were more comfortable than I thought they would be. They are hard to take off, especially if you don\u2019t have socks on. But that\u2019s what you get when you get tall boots. They do their job... we are building a home and our land is full of mud right now. These have helped tremendously!", "I\u2019ve had these a few years now, still going strong! Comfy and easy to clean. Used them in Texas during hurricane harvey flooding. Good height to wade through some waters. Worth the price!", "Not even a month after receiving them, they started to crack where my ankles bend and the right heel has come unsealed. When I walk I can hear air and water bubbling out which makes me wonder if they have mold growing in them\ud83d\ude23", "I bought these for my son's fiance\u0301 for Christmas and she loves them. I bought the first pair and they were not adjustable and they were too tight on her calves. Returned those for this adjustable pair and she said they fit much better. She has small legs so you may want to keep that in mind.", "I like how these boots look when they don\u2019t have the white chalky stuff on them. Additionally, they are not very comfortable. A little arch support would be nice. I would not buy them again.", "I wish I would of listened to the other reviews. I wear a size 8. They are huge! I'm returning for a size 7. These run a full size off. Next time I'll heed what the reviews say.", "Do not buy if you have wide calves...this is not true to wise calves....seller was quick item arrived in great condition. But hunter you need to work on size inclusivity!!", "I can not fit a regular boot past my calf. I normally wear a size 7.5 and the size 8 is roomy but I can\u2019t manage in a size 7 at all due to the ankle and heel area being too small.", "I have a 15 inch calf. When the boots are fully extended, they just look sloppy. Even fully extended they are super tight. I wear a size 6 and purchased a size 6. The boots seem to actually suck onto my leg and foot making it impossible to get off. Highly disappointed!", "The portion that expands is too short...its only at the very top of the boot so at mid calf there is no expansion and they were too tight to be comfortable. Had to return.", "I\u2019m a size 7 and the 7\u2019s fit perfect. I have a wider calf and have never been able to wear a classic narrow hunter boot. This Wide calf option is perfect.", "Love these boot! I originally ordered a 8 because that\u2019s my normal shoe size, but for sure go for a size smaller, I returned it and got a size 7 and they it perfectly! So darn comfy!", "I use these for working on a dairy farm, and they got a hole in them after only 3 months. FYI \"Rumbling Red\" is a very light cranberry red color. The photo makes it look nearly black which is nowhere near the real color. They're really nice boots if you don't have to work hard in them.", "These authentic Hunter boots are beautifully made, and a great deal on Amazon. They are very comfortable, and fit nicely in the calves, with room to spare over pants because of the adjustable buckles. I am slightly shorter than 5' 2\", and was surprised that they weren't too tall for me. I wear them with thicker Softest Socks, as there is room for them in my usual size 8. Very pleased to finally have these boots!", "I had to return a few to get the correct fit for me. I wear 6.5 but the 6 as recommended was too smug, especially when taking them off, with even a lightweight sock. The 7 is doable with lightweight sock but also am waiting to receive the Sherpa insole. Definitely the 7 will accommodate a heavier sock in colder weather to make them more versatile.", "Great protection for the rain or mud. Not too difficult to put on and off, my previous boots were a nightmare to take off. The quality is just awesome, fits and look great. Hope they will last for a few years.", "These are definitely NOT knock offs! The red dot on the bottom is a seal of authenticity. They are very high quality. I love these boots so much! I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and the boots hit my lower knees. They are a bit tall on me, but still comfortable and cute! I wear a size 7 1/2 in most shoes. I sized up to an 8 so I could wear thick socks with these. They fit as expected. The adjustable backs make them comfortable and tailored to my liking. Highly recommend! : D", "Bought the size 6 on my prime for my boss. She doesn\u2019t have prime so used my account. When they didn\u2019t fit her, she offered them to me for free. The boots fit me about perfectly and I wear a 8-8.5. Read the sizing carefully before purchase. I got some really nice boots out of the deal, but my boss was disappointed.", "I wanted these to fit but my soccer calves were tight and then it looked super big and bulky around my ankles. Good boot but not for big calves like mine.", "After a few returns of different styles these were the ones that worked for me. I have a larger calf and tall boots are difficult to fit. I\u2019ve been wanting a pair of Hunters for Spring and messy Winters and these are great.", "The boots themselves appear to be fine however, presentation is sometimes EVERYTHING!! The actual shoe box that contained the boots was in absolute AWFUL condition! When giving a gift of such a high dollar name brand, one would expect the box to look nice also. The box was cut in multiple places and crushed on one side. The damage was not from the USPS because the shoe box was then covered with a heavy plastic envelope for mailing.", "this came within two days despite being standard shipping, it also shipped very promptly. arrived in good condition and a very nice large box packaging. i have the navy blue one and it looks like a muted/faded black in some lighting but i\u2019m not mad at it. super nice quality and fits and feels great. highly recommend! hopefully it lasts me a long time.", "Love my boots, easy to slip off and on, wear them in the snow with wool socks and my feet stay warm! Great for New England weather in all seasons! I take long walks and they are very comfortable even then!", "Even though it is adjustable at the back for wide calf right below the adjustable strap is not wide enough therefore my calf was fitting tighter..", "The first few wears, the boot rubbed up against my shin and caused indentations on my shin which hurt a bit. After the boots were essentially broken it, I had no durther problems with them. My only wish is that the buckle was a little more discreet. Also, with no ventilation, my feet actually end up wet due to sweat.", "The only problem I have with my rain boots is that they never fit correctly around my calves. But that's probably just a \"me\" problem. Otherwise, these boots are amazing and they and great for the rain AND the snow. I also got the Hunter boot socks and they keep my feet so warm and cozy! Love these boots. I'm very happy with this purchase.", "Got this for my Fiance\u0301e for Christmas. She loves them and uses them all the time! The only thing she has an issue with is when she walks sometimes the outer top of the boots rub up against her shins...", "I love these boots! I love the fact that I can adjust the calf width if necessary. I normally wear a 7 1/2- 8. I purchased the size 8 in these boots. I think the fit is perfect. I wear normal socks with them, but there is still room if I wanted to wear a thicker pair.", "I've always wanted a pair of Hunters but knew my calves were \"too big\" for standard tall boots - these are everything I expected & more, I do not think I could love a child as much as I love these boots", "My wife loves these boots. And now she spots them on TV every time someone is wearing them. I just can't convince her they aren't appropriate office attire!", "I have been looking for a proper wide calf for a long time! I didn't think I'd find it with HUNTER. But, I did. So happy!!!", "Love these! I usually wear a 8.5 and the 9 fits great and they r super comfy. I originally ordered an 8 bc of reviews and had to exchange.", "Great for wide calves. Adjustable. I lovr these, actual Hunter boots. Pair them with bootsocks for added warmth.", "FAKE!!! My last pair of Hunters lasted a solid 5 years. I\u2019ve had these less than 6 months and finish is peeling off.. they are already completely ruined! They are larger, bulkier and inside labels are different.", "STYLE: Absolutely love these. Ordered these after I almost got stuck in the Tall Classic: calf opening was too small on those These adjustable back boots are great. I ordered black matte FUNCTION: I'll update after I get these wet. Quarantining is affecting my clamming game", "I LOVE these boots!! They run a bit larger... usually I'm a 6 - ordered a 5 - Perfect fit even with thick socks !", "I am a solid size 8, with a 16.5 inch calf. I originally ordered the size 8 boots, but these were way too big, so I traded them in for size 7. I was a bit nervous going down a whole size, but these fit perfectly with plenty of room in the calf. Really great boots, cute and sturdy!", "I first bought the Original tall and they were too tight around my calves. These have an adjustable back that will allow anyone with larger calves to wear. Love them, well made. I\u2019m so excited!!", "Girlfriend loves then. She has large calves because we hike in the north east a great deal so these actually adjusted perfectly", "I don't know if it's just because I have fat calves,but they're snug in that area,which seems to make the boot crease at the ankles.", "Love these boots! Wish I could find them in more colors, though. The regular style Won\u2019t fit my calves.", "I love these boots! They are very fashionable! The only thing I have a problem with is that when I tighten them all the way, it bulges out in the back. Other than that, I love these boots. I went stomping in puddles with my little cousin and I also was walking around in a pond. No water leakage!! I would recommend you get different inserts though if you need arch support.", "Love these birds I am an older woman and have flat feet now so everything is a lot wider in these boots are excellent even with a pair of thick socks they\u2019re a little heavy but You get used to it", "These boots are so cute and comfy! I am a size 8 1/2 or 9 sometimes, so I went with the sz 9. They fit just right. I get numerous compliments when I wear them \ud83d\ude0a", "Well made but still didn\u2019t fit my calves. I don\u2019t have HUGE calves. I usually need extended calves in boots so they aren\u2019t super tight. These were just awkward. They fit my calves but we\u2019re really tight against the front part of my shin.", "Love the boots. The calf is wide enough on this design to accommodate my leg in jeans. The height of the shaft is about 1/2\" higher than I would like, but not a real issue. Will likely put some in soles in the base to fix that and give a little extra support. Great customer service.", "I wanted these to work, but they\u2019re not made for my curvy calves. The adjustable back is really not attractive, either.", "Item was bought as a gift. My daughter loved they but they went up to high on her calf. She is 5'4\" and they rubbed the back of her leg. She is returning them for a shorter pair.", "These are great rain boots. I am glad I found these because I have big calves and the adjustable strap allows me to FINALLY have y\u2019all rain boots. They are excellent for rain and keep my feet dry. Love them", "Excellent and versatile boots. It'll cover both rain and snow. Looks attractive.", "Love these boots! I had my Classic Uggs for years and years but recently had to retire them and wanted something that was 1) easy to clean 2) tall 3) warm 4) waterproof, and 5) had good tread. These boots had ALL of these. Although I did originally order the ones without the adjustable back and they did not fit my calves but I am SO happy with these! Very warm even without warm/wool socks (I live in Minnesota, so that's saying a lot). Also so easy to clean. A damp paper towel can clean them right up. Would definitely recommend!", "Wow, I love these Hunter Boots, fit was as expected and I am glad I took my time deciding to get the original back adjustable boots I have thick calves and these boots are well worth buying.", "Really fits a wide calf without looking too big. The adjustable back really makes a difference and allows you to fit it just right and to your comfort. Wide calf boots can sometimes look unflattering because they don\u2019t have much shape, but these taper in at the ankle so they look slimming. Really happy I bought these and I got them for such a great price!", "Product cracked after three months of use. If you are going to wear them outside often, forget about it. Move on.", "Love these boots, very good quality as to be expected by Hunter. I was happy to learn these were the real deal and arrived on time from Amazon. Original packaging and everything.

I have wide calves so the adjustable back is great. Love these boots!", "Love them! Worth the money! Super comfy, roomy calf space.", "I'm pleased that I ordered, When I read the the reviews. I did have mixed emotions. Because of the majority of people a opinions was the calf fits tight. So I decide to order Hunter Boot with the adjustable straps in the back.", "Item came shiny black not matte black as the description stated. So unfortunate because wanted to use it on our trip. Will be returning", "It crazy about them incredibly floppy even with thick pants", "FINALLY found a pair of Hunters that fits my calves.

There is no two-toned back pink like in the \u201corder\u201d photos.", "They aren't cheap but worth the money. They keep my feet dry, are comfortable, heavy duty. I'm a 7 in everything and these are a little loose without the boot sock.", "These were great in every way EXCEPT length of boot. As a 5\u20193\u201d person with sort legs, these boot came all the way up to my knees and I couldn\u2019t wear them. Unfortunately, I had to return them.", "Great quality, runs a little large but not by too much. Heavy socks will fill the maybe 1/2 size gap.", "I am happy to have found a pair of boots that have adjustable width. Would recommend to anyone who is in between wide and regular width calf.", "Bought a larger size per the other reviews about the calf width. Still doesn\u2019t fit. I have larger calves but they aren\u2019t huge. If I went larger the shoe portion would be too big.

But my feet's future looks good in it.", "In general, these type of boots run a size larger. Normally, I wear a 10 but I bought a nine (as suggested in the reviews) and they\u2019re a perfect fit! I will say they\u2019re difficult to take off as most boots to the knees are. I purchased the navy (slate) color - love them!", "I don't wear thick socks and purchased my normal size 7.

I had so much room my foot almost slipped out. They would be horribly uncomfortable to wear and they were so huge around my calf that rain would pour right in. Sadly sent them back.", "Live these boots so much. They are a bit heavy but very useful when the weather is rough", "The quality and look of these boots is pretty good, but they are a pain to take off! I'll probably just stick with the one pair I have (since they are quite pricey and not that impressive).", "I originally ordered the boots without the straps and they fit way too tightly on my calves. These are perfect because I adjust them to fit exactly how I want! I would absolutely recommend these, especially if the non-adjustable boots are too tight on your calves.", "So glad they now come with an adjustable back. Super warm and my legs stay nice and dry. Worth the money", "These boots are amazing! I read reviews about these boots from multiple websites that sell them and decided to buy these adjustable ones because I have bigger calves than most women. They fit perfect! I ordered my usual size which is a 9. For some boots I even size up to 10 because I have wide feet but these fit me perfect and they feel durable and are definitely a good investment. I'd recommend to order your normal size and if you're looking for water proof boots that are also super cute and stylish, I'd buy these in a heart beat!", "I wear a 9 1/2 and bought an 8 1/2 and they fit great. I read reviews prior to purchasing so I knew to size down. Otherwise I would have been sad. Love the height and adjustable back as I have large calves. These are perfect for the gloomy weather I just moved in too. Want them in every color now!", "I wear an 81/2. My right foot is bigger than my left. The 8's were too small. The 9's were a tad big but with an insole and a sock they are just right!!", "Tiny but big for my normal size, but should fit fine with boot socks. Love love love these boots!!!! Durable, stylish and a total staple for my wardrobe. Perfect for winter and spring rain!", "Awesome boot, made well and durable, however I am normally a size 7 (with 90% of all other shoes) and had to order an entire size down to a 6 for these boots to fit", "Loved having my rain boots ready for a super rainy day at work. They are perfect! So comfortable! I am thinking about getting another pair!", "I'm very pleased with the overall fit. Wish half sizes were available. Going to add supportive insoles which will correct both of my issues. I hope.", "I love these boots, they fit very well. It does get a bit uncomfortable to wear the tall boots after so many hours. I am thinking of getting the shorter boots as well.", "Love them! I'm 5\"4 and they are not to talk, adjustable back allows me to wear jeans or leggings. They are hard to get on and off but the 7 fits perfect with socks( I'm a true 7 1/2 with wide feet) they are also very warm. I'm glad I went with these as I have a 15 1/2 calf. They are not tight at all even on smallest pull. If you are 5\"4 defiantly go with these verse the huntress.", "I love these boots! I am 5 ft tall and they are a little high for my short legs, they come right up to my knees, but they don't bother me. I normally wear a size 6.5 and ordered a 6 based on the reviews I read; they fit perfectly. They are comfortable right off the bat, I didn't need to break them in at all. I wore them all day for two days in a row after receiving them and I walk at least 40 minutes a day for my commute. They are not only comfortable but they look great too. Great boots that arrived quickly!", "Perfect for the athletic women who have muscular calves that are just slightly too big for normal boots or for women who prefer to wear thicker socks with their rain boots. I tried the Hunter originals on in the store and they fit, but not comfortably - they have a 15in calf circumference, while these have a 16-17in calf circumference depending on the adjustable tab. I can wear these ones all day without a problem. I would suggest trying them on in a store before ordering though, as they did ship from the UK and I'm not sure how the return policy works. Love these boots!", "This company is a bit of a pain for returns. The product fits way to big and I am still having a hard time getting the right information i need to return this item. For the price of this product, it is definitely a pain. The boots it self are great. I wear a 7.5 and ordered an 8, due to not selling half sizes. The size 7 would have been the right choice.", "I've been using these boots all day everyday ever since I got them. Not lying. AMAZING!", "Loved these boots! Perfect for rainy days! I normally wear size 5.5 or 6, so these where great.", "Get one size bigger than ur original size. I'm a size six I will buy size 7", "Arrived quickly, packaged nicely, quality product. Love these boots!!!! Only thing people fail to point out is when they bend and they are super floppy and look goofy. Lol", "They fit perfectly and were very durable. I love them!", "Love love love these. Can't wait to get the liners too.", "Je vais e\u0301changer les bottes car elles sont bcp trop grandes", "Excellent boots! Super cute. I read through lots of reviews and decided to size down, unfourtantly, I wish I wouldn't have. I suggest getting your regular size.", "Wish they kept your feet warmer! Kids size 3 fit me better then the women\u2019s size 5\u2019s. But super cute", "They recommended if you're a size 8.5 to get size 8 but it was too small. I just want to exchange it for a size 9", "After reading other reviews, I sized down. I normally wear a 8.5 or 9 depending on the shoe. I ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly. They are tall - come up to just below the knee cap (I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d). I\u2019ve only worn them a few times since they arrived but they feel comfortable and solid. I wear wellies often so it was worth the price.", "My 1st pair of Hunter & no joke worth the wait & money. Best decision I've ever made. Beautiful, well made boot. Im normally size 7 in boots so I got the 7, fits fine with thicker socks. Does not hit the back of my legs & I'm 5'4. A little getting used to at first walking but after awhile you forget you even have them on, until you realized how awesome they look on you. Compliments left & right even strangers. Trust me ladies, go get a pair. Ordered on Sunday & received on Tuesday, came all the way from Great Britain..makes it that much more special!!..bought the Navy color, thinking about the gloss in red next."], "label": "test", "generated_meta_review": "Love these boots.

However, these ran a little small, but stretched out nicely with wear. I got them specifically for hiking the Narrows in Zion National Park and they performed beautifully. The bottom had stellar grip for scrambling over wet rocks, and they dried quickly. After several hours of water hiking and climbing, I had no blisters or sore spots. They also worked great for land hikes in the extreme heat, as they have great ventilation and grip. I highly recommend these!", "First time buyer of Merrell shoes.... AND I LOVE THEM! I always purchased Nike and Reebok, but decided to take a chance on these. I work as a CNA in a hospital with concrete floors and these are the most comfortable shoes I have tried yet! I will be buying Merrell shoes again!", "So impressed with these shoes! Recently hiked 17 water miles in one day in them and my feet hardly hurt at the end of the day (my feet always hurt at about 10 miles in my regular hiking boots)! I was concerned about them letting too many rocks and sand in but my friend I was hiking with was complaining about rocks and sand in her shoes and I didn't have that problem at all! They almost wear like a light tennis shoe and had great traction for the rock hopping I was doing all day. Can't say enough good about them!", "I absolutely LOVE these shoes! I have NEVER bought a pair of hiking shoes that didn't give me blisters. Out of the box, these never have given me even one blister. I hiked the Grand Canyon, Rim-to-Rim, 24 miles without a single blister:)", "I work at a garden center & finding a shoe that had enough grip to walk across slippery & rocky terrain was difficult to find. I bought expensive waterproof shoes that, in the end, only retained water instead of repelling it & water sandals that blistered my feet no matter how long I wore them. These shoes are perfect for my specific needs, except that I only get a year\u2019s wear out of them. The picture shows the flaws after a years worth of wear, hence the 4 stars. I guess my point is...c\u2019mon Merrell. There are tons of gardeners & landscapers that are dedicated to your high priced shoe. Why not make one that lasts a little longer?", "I was very surprised when I put these on, there is no inside padding and the tongue is not padded. It may sound weird but it was like wearing the unlined bra of shoes. It felt like maybe at one point it was meant to be a closed shoe with padding (a waterproof and not a mesh) and then they just took it out and called it a new shoe. They are very roomy but I have small feet. I would have had to lace them very tight to get a snug feel like other shoes. They just felt unfinished. What was there was a great Merrell quality, just didn't seem finished on the inside.", "I love the size and fit of my shoe. I wore them on one hike so far and the grip was excellent. However, my laces were caught, causing one of the straps to rip. I\u2019m really bummed because I\u2019ve only had these for two weeks and they haven\u2019t lasted as long as I\u2019d have liked. Durability was something I was looking for especially for the price I was paying.", "I scoured the reviews because I work outside on my feet and sometimes on the shores of a lake. I also have had a bad case of plantar fasciitis for 7 months and really needed a summer shoe that could give me support. I\u2019ve been impressed with the quality of this shoe. Wears like a trail shoe but works well for water shoes. Sole is flexible but has good arch support. Dries quickly, especially if you leave out in the sun. I\u2019m buying another pair now so that when these wear out I wont have to start the search all over again", "I have been looking for the perfect hiking shoes. I'm a minimalist kind of girl but everything out there that claimed to be minimalist so far, was far from it. As soon as I tried these shoes on, I loved them! I strongly recommend them if you're looking for something light with plenty of grip and support on the sole, these are the perfect shoes. Merrell is AWESOME!", "Been wearing these shoes for ages. Great comfort and fit. Hike everywhere in them. Travel everywhere in them. They are light and easy to clean. I put them in the wash on a gentle cycle and air dry them. As good as it gets.", "Love these so much have them in 2 colors. Keep me going as a nurse for about 13 hours before my feet start to get sore, but that\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever found!!!!!", "These are the best shoes ever!! I have three pair in different colors and I love them so much. They are lightweight, have a large toe box, breathable fabric, great support and grippy sole. I wear them hiking and just running errands. I do not recommend them for actual running but that is not what they are made for anyway. I recommend them to everyone! I found that I normally wear a 7-7.5 depending on what brand but I needed an 8. I had tried them on in a store before purchasing so I knew what size I needed when buying online.", "Size 8 fits true to size. Nice, sleek small footprint (not oversized or clunky) for this rugged kind of shoe. Super cute. Also, like other Merrell shoes, they fit my narrow foot fine. There is some arch support. Nice room for toes, more than other Merrell shoes I have. Aggressive look but without being bulky. Decent traction. Lightweight. I run in the woods in them. Breathable. I hope to use them at some point in water in summer too. Not good for muddy conditions of course due to the open breathable mesh.", "This is a great hiking sneaker- no break in time. Wore them to hike Glacier National Park in summer right out of the box. Have had them two months and wear a lot- so far they are holding up. I wear a size 8 but sized up to 8.5 and toe box was too tight. Returned them and got the size 9 but had to put an insole from another pair of Merrill\u2019s inn the shoes to take up some space. I had plenty of toe room for hiking downhill. Would buy again. Did not get waterproof version so am now ordering the waterproof mid height version for another winter hiking trip.", "Read reviews of healthcare workers loving these so I thought I give them a try, hoping it would help my plantar fasciitis. I work on my feet in a busy PACU 10-12 hours at a time. Within a week, my feet began to ache mid-shift, by week two I could barely walk in the mornings because my plantar Fasciitis flared. Had to return them. Disappointed because they are really cute, but there is almost no support in the toes.", "I normally wear a 8.5 for work shoes and a 9 in sports shoes to make sure I have room in the toe box and because my feet are wider usually need a wide shoe. A 9 in this pair - my toes hit the front of the shoe while walking, so they definitely run smaller than expected. There\u2019s also one spot where the mesh on the side meets the shoe material that rubs on the inside of my foot. The construction is good and I wish they were the right size because they look like they\u2019d be great for rucking which is what I bought them for.", "I've worn Brooks exclusively for years as my hiking and trail running shoes. No more. From the first second I put these on my feet I was all in. Fantastic. Holds my foot solid in the shoe thanks to great mid foot fit around the arch area. No slipping when hiking up rocks. Generous toe box which is a mist for me, especially when hiking downhill. I must have said it a thousand times on the trail, I love these shoes.", "I love these shoes. Used on my hooneymoon in Hawaii. We did a lot of hiking and all my wife and I kept saying were how great these shoes were. We has tons of grip, very comfortable and stylish. The shoes really shines when we had to cross this 2 foot stream of water and the shoes got wet, Yes the shoes were intended to get wet and didn't have that soak like feeling compared t averaged shoes. I will now become a customer of Merrell products. I bought 2 pairs, one for myself and my wife. These shoes are perfect for hiking, especially knowing your feet may get wet. We noticed people kept looking at our shoes.", "I am so happy with these shoes. I was looking for a pair of quick drying hiking shoes specifically for creeks since we pretty much live for creek hiking in the summer. But they exceeded my expectations, and I now where them for gardening, errands, walks and creek hiking! I expected them to get a little stinky after wading through creek water, but no. They dry very fast and clean up easily. They are super comfy with or without socks. They are so convenient and I love them!", "This is my second pair. The first lasted me a few years, and once they were ready to be retired I already knew I was going to get another pair. I did try some Salomon shoes and absolutely hated them. They were stiff, uncomfortable. So far Merrell\u2019s are the only shoe I\u2019ve bought that I can receive them and go hiking the next day without having to break them in. Love them would absolutely recommend", "These are very useful shoes, lightweight but enough support for hiking. I am a 9 with a somewhat narrow foot. The toe box was roomy but the laces allowed for tightening. I wear them with a thin sock, for me a thick sock is too much on length. Very high quality. This is much more than a water shoes but love that versatility. Love the color options, might buy a second pair!", "These are the best shoes. Wore them on the jmt for 7 days. They took me over 80 miles on rocky terrain and they're still in good condition. Lightweight and the sole is durable. The ventilation keeps things cool - which is what i love - but your feet will get dirty in Sandy conditions.", "Happy feet. Out of the box very comfortable. Lightweight, good arch. I like the look, too. I wear a size 10 and with the dark color around shoe and sole my feet almost look small. Took dog for 2 mile walk and not a single ouch spot. Love these shoes!", "NOTE: \"Water\" Shoe doesn't mean it will keep your feet dry. This beautiful, well-fitting, well-made, light weight trail running shoe has mesh sides so you can run through creeks without them getting water-logged and they will air dry. I'm looking forward to enjoying the breathable material when running in hot conditions. I added some very slim arch supports and may later add an athletic insert.", "Love how they fit straight out of the box! Super comfy. Love the vented sides. Especially love the wide toe box! I haven't yet walked in them other than briefly around the house to check fit. But right now, I'm super happy with this purchase.", "I bought these shoes for hiking. I have been on the search for hiking shoes for several years, since the soles literally fell off of my others, and have returned all of them. It was a bit risky of me but I wore these for the first time when I hiked a 14er in Colorado. These shoes are amazing! I love everything about them but mainly the fact that they may be the first pair of shoes I have ever purchased that did not give me blisters. I usually wear a 10, I bought a 10, and they fit perfect! Highly recommend!!", "I bought these with the hope that they would be as comfortable as my previous pair of Merrel's which fit true to size and had wonderful arch support, not to mention long lasting. I wore them for three years solid before the insoles started to break down. I absolutely Loved those shoes. This pair is NOTHING like the pair I was hoping to replace. They run large and have Zero arch support. My foot was cramping horribly after half a days wear. I would not recommend this particular pair of Merrel's. I'm hoping to find a different style that offers the same stability that my previous pair did. These were not it.", "There's not much padding for the sole, but I just added dr. scholl's to compensate. I have wide feet w/ bunions & flat arch, so these are good enough support for work. I don't need my orthotics. I havn't use them yet for hiking & what not, but if they're comfy enough for work, I usually find that they'll be fine for anything else. I live in Hawaii, so I wanted cooler shoes, sneakers are hot on some days & these shoes fit the bill b/c of the mesh fabric.", "They are super cute and I was hoping they could be more of an all around shoe as well, but they really are only a water shoe. The footbed liner does not come out so my orthotics added too much height to the heel area so my heel moved around too much and didnt have enough support. If I didnt need orthotics, or if the foot bed liner came out, they would have been perfect.", "They were so comfortable that I bragged on and on on our first hike. So much that I probably got on my family\u2019s nerves. Then as we crossed the shallow creek, I remembered previous reviews on the slipperiness of the shoes as my feet were in the air before I could even brace myself! It was like the tread disappeared. Guess I deserved it with all that bragging! Still love these hiking shoes! I\u2019ll just remember the slickness.", "These shoes are so comfortable. I got them for an Alaska cruise, but have been wearing them around to break them in (turns out, that isn't really necessary). LOVE these shoes! I ordered .5 size up from normal and they feel perfect, with a little room to swell during hikes.", "I've worn Merrell for many many years, and a closet full!! What happen to them? I love the color and style of this, but the arch area around the toes/pad of foot is Way off!! Very uncomfortable!! And more narrow than their typical shoe. Then on this style, the siding is a net/mesh fabric; I live in sand, this will not work! Very disappointed!! Returning.", "I bought Merrell shoes in the past because they address an issue many woman have: a narrow heel. These still work, but there is now a hint of a rub where in the past designs there was not. Please go back to narrow heels. That feature will help people like me. For those with a wider back foot, the heel naturally stretched over time. Otherwise, a nice shoe.", "I love the style and look of these shoes. However, they don't work with wide feet.", "its a nice looking sneaker but after the first normal city use it starts to look old. if you use it somewhere where there is a lot of earth dust, it will immediately get inside the shoe, therefore they probably won't even survive a drizzle. I find it odd.", "These shoes exceeded my expectations! I got this pair for my trip to orlando because of the need for water shoes for a manatee swim as well as hiking that would be done throughout the week. They were perfect on the boat for stability. ( I didn\u2019t submerge the shoes under water during the swim). The shoes are comfortable and supportive. I wore these shoes for 12 hours between the water activity and sightseeing at national park on one day. On other days they perfect for a hike and at the parks. They were the only dry thing on me after Rip Saw Falls at Universal!", "These shoes look amazing! I love the style. Unfortunately, I think these shoes must be made for people with a high arch. Every time I take a step, I feel like my foot is being bruised by the high \u201clump\u201d in the middle, under my foot. I definitely can\u2019t wear these for more than just a few minutes. I was really hoping they\u2019d work out, as they are really great looking shoes!", "I really like this shoe; however, I had to return it because it was too narrow. This style does not offer the wide option so I've found another Merrell shoe that does, but I wish this did because I would've kept it! I usually wear 8 or 8.5 depending on the make, but for Merrell, I have to order 9. The length was fine, again just the width too narrow.", "I loved this shoe in the sage color so much that I bought another pair in the beige color. But to my surprise, the same size in the different color was too small! So I returned them. In general, this show runs big for me. I typically wear size 9, and the 8.5 fit perfectly in the sage color. In the beige, the 8.5 was too small, but the arch placement of the 9 was wrong for me. Sad! Still, I gave it a four star rating because I love my first pair so much - comfy and awesome as a water shoe or warm weather hiking/outdoor shoe.", "These shoes a are very comfortable with a roomy toe box and a width that isn't too wide for my somewhat narrow fit. The mesh keeps my feet from overheating. I wear a 10.5, and I'm pleased that my feet don't look like clodhoppers in these shoes. I only have two complaints. First, the arch support is inadequate for me, so I do supplement with other insoles. Second, apparently this style is no longer made, so this is \"one of the last\" pairs in my size I was able to find. Why do shoe companies do this!!!???", "These shoes are great for walking/ hiking/ biking etc. Although, I would not wear them in wet weather as they are not made to be waterproof or water resistant. Other reviews said to order a size larger than you normally wear. I ordered an 8 (my normal size) and they fit great. Very comfortable to wear and walk in all day. Love the color of these shoes. Seems hard to find shoes that don't have gaudy neon colors all over them. I plan on wearing these on my trip to Scotland and look forward to comfortable feet and not looking like an American tourist.", "I love these shoes. They are just as I expected from thr description and photos. Best walking shoes i have ever purchased and worn. Happy I put the money in for good shoes, especially I have wide feet and tendonitis. I bought a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size to make sure they fit and Im happy I did to leave space for when my feet swell up or I wear thicker hiking socks. Highly reccommend.", "These are great water shoes that you can hike in all day. Water flows in and out of them easily and they dry out relatively quickly. I wear them a lot in the hot summer months, even when there are no water crossings to contend with, because they are cool on the feet with the mess openings. I'd rate the traction as reasonably good. I wore these in the Narrows at Zion, and although my feet were freezing, they were sturdy enough to handle the slippery rocks.", "I bought these shoes to wear while hiking The Narrows in Zion Canyon. They were awesome! They saved my feet from getting beat up by the river rocks and did an great job gripping so I wasn't slipping all over the place. Water drains from these really well. I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly. I am so glad I made the investment. I also use these for normal hiking and they are great.", "The most important thing is the fabulous purple color! Love it! I am an ER nurse and on my feet 12 + hours a day going non stop. I have several pairs of shoes I wear but my Merrells are my favorite. This pair is even better than my others! Wide enough toe box for my bunion, just enough arch support snd cushy enough to run in all day. Great price too! Wore them all day right out of the box.", "These shoes are remarkably similar in style and cut details to another pair of Merrells I own and which fit perfectly. When I tried on these new ones, they were way too big. I finally figured out the difference is that these water shoes don't have an insole. I slipped one in from an old pair of trainers and they fit just right. I don't intend to wear them in water but rather for hot weather hiking, so it was a good solution for me.", "Merrell products perform well, if you can get the right size. The length has been right for the several pairs I've bought in the last year through Amazon. But the width can vary, at least in my case. I order a 7 1/2 for closed shoes and a width of \"B\" but the width has varied. At least that's my impression. This shoe works for all kinds of terrain, but the shoe seems wider than the others I have. So I wear heavier socks, which isn't what I intended for a breathable WP shoe. Still very happy with this pair which I will bring to Europe in the near future (cobblestone streets and lengthy walks).", "This style Merrells didn\u2019t work as well for me as others have so I went a different route. I felt like there wasn\u2019t as much arch support as other styles and I had trouble on my five mile walks. There was also a small defect on the tongue but after contacting Merrell directly they took care of it. A great company!", "I am so happy with these hiking shoes! I'm not much of a hiker, I bought them for work (dirty, wet garden center). They are so comfortable. The arch support is great and they fit true to size. Very well made and look great too. I'm very pleased with this purchase.", "I bought this shoe in an 11B (M), thinking I was buying a men\u2019s size 11. The description at the top of page I was shopping on states \u201cMerrel Men\u2019s All Out Blaze...\u201d. When I realized my mistake I was concerned because I typically wear a women\u2019s 12B, but the shoes already shipped. Luckily these shoes have a wide toe box and even though they are a tad shorter than I like I am able to wear these. I also like the sole is a bit stiffer than the tennis shoes I wear and offer more support.", "I have always been a size 8 in Merrell's and I like them because they are always fit my narrow heels but this time the 8 is too big and the heel slips so I'm hoping the 7.5 will fit better. The arch support is still so comfy in these I did not want to take them off despite the wrong fit.", "I ordered a size 8 after reading reviews. I had to return them for an 8 1/2 which I have never worn. After getting a good fit I have worn them on several 3+ mile walks. They are very comfortable and work well. I purchased them for a trip where I will have lots of walking, some on uneven and rough terrain. I believe they will be very good for that purpose", "My first pair of Merrells were worth the money. I wear them on daily walks and local hikes. They offer great support and handle rocky surfaces and incline/decline well. I like the vibrant hues because it matches a lot of my athletic gear. I read reviews that these ran small on some people? I at first thought they would be too large, but they fit just right! Phew!", "Got this shoe for wet-dry hiking in Hawaii (waterfall trails etc) because of its breathable quick dry structure and grippy Vibram sole. Haven\u2019t gotten to try them on the trails yet, but I\u2019ve worn them to work in the hospital and lab and they are great for that too! They are comfortable, flexible, and good for all day standing and walking. As far as hiking shoes go, I think they are also look pretty nice as well.", "I bought my first pair over a year ago and when it was \"past\" time for a new pair of walking shoes I bought these again. I need a wider toe box and these work great. My only complaint would be the shoe laces on the latest pair are much shorter than my previous pair. When you have high arches that matters.", "These shoes are phenomenal! I hiked in the Smoky Mountains with these, on fairly rough terrain, and they held up just fine. The grip is incredible! I have worn the many other times walking and hiking, and using them in the water, they are perfect!", "My first pair. Toe box is roomy and the shoes fit right out of the box. I ordered my regular shoe size. Wore them all day and no blisters, comfortable, cool, excellent grip on sole. Looking forward to a long hike this weekend! Glad I bought these.", "My second pair of this exact shoe!! Not disappointed...and Amazon offers it at such a nice discount!! These are the best shoes... lightweight comfort right outa the box!!", "I bought these shoes for my 10 mile Havasupai backpacking trip and without needing to break them in, they fit very comfortably. I was able to wear thick hiking socks with them and put in my insoles for better arch support.", "Love these hiking shoes. They are lightweight, fit perfectly, and best of all, allow air in to keep your feet cool. They immediately felt comfortable on my feet. I wore them the first time without socks, and I didn't get a blister or even a sore spot on either foot. They have a nice tread for hiking. I look forward to using them for water sports too. I highly recommend this shoe for outdoor activities.", "Loved these shoes! Purchased them for hiking around Kauai for 2 weeks. They did a good job. Comfy, fairly good amount of toe-box room, grippy. It was VERY muddy on our trip and the shoes did great. Not so good on slippery river rocks, but what shoe really does. I wear a size 6 and ordered a 6.5, perfect fit.", "My new favorite shoe! So lightweight, cool, and comfy! The best arch support of any shoe that I own! I walk 2 or 3 miles per day for work, and stand up a lot. Outdoors in Alabama summers, they're perfect! I'm watching the sales to get another color!", "Love these but they aren\u2019t holding up well. I did a few 3-5 mile hikes in them and wore them to work for about two weeks and the fabric is ripping away near the toe already. I always wear a size 8, I purchased an 8 and they fit perfect. They don\u2019t have any cushioning but are still comfy.", "These shoes are great for adventures. I've used them on caves, waterfalls, rivers, beaches, trekking, you name it. They are reliable and very hard to slip. I would only change one thing; I wish the sand didn't get inside these shoes as much as it does. That's the only defect I find on them.", "Love them! They are very comfortable, lightweight- not heavy uncomfortable shoes. They passed my hiking test. Didn\u2019t slip not once. Very cute too since most hiking shoes are ugly. Will definitely buy this brand from now on for my hiking shoes.", "I tried a verity of different hiking shoes and these were perfect for me. super comfortable and true to size. The material can be annoying if you are hiking in really sandy or dust trails because the dust will get through the holes. But last weekend I went on a hike with a stream. I accidentally got my feet in the stream and both my feet were soaked but dried completely within 30 minutes. Very good traction also. Love these hiking shoes!", "These Merrell hiking shoes are so comfortable. I ordered them in my usual size and they fit perfectly. I use them for my daily walks on trails, concrete and asphalt and they are great on all surfaces. After a 4 mile rugged hike, they still felt comfortable. They are great right out of the box and I would definitely buy them again.", "This is hands down the best shoe I've ever owned. So very comfortable, and I don't have to worry if I get them wet. They're made for that! These aren't made anymore, so I bought a second pair!!", "The BEST shoe.... although a watershoe.... I\u2019ve ever had!!! Finally. I have plantar fasciitis and need more of these types of shoes. Normal fit. Love the \u201cvery grape\u201d ordered the blue as my second pair!!", "I\u2019ve been a Merrell fan for years, and my size has remained consistent. Unfortunately these fit much smaller than all my other Women\u2019s size 10 Merrells. The shoe is tighter width-wise than all of my others, and the arch is too far forward on my foot.", "Extremely comfortable shoes. No wearing in period. I have a wide toe box due to bunions and bone structure but my heal width is regular. I usually have to tie my shoes tight to keep the shoe snug on my heal which ends being really uncomfortable on the top of my foot. These shoes fit perfect in the toe box area and the heal.", "I have planters fasciitis and always add an extra insoles even in Merrill\u2019s. Still these were great for walking all over Vietnam and Cambodia. Light supportive and comfortable. They were good in the city and country. My only complaint is the short laces!", "These hiking shoes are so lightweight and comfortable! I tested them out Father's Day weekend on a family hike. The grip was incredible. I had to walk across several creek crossings and my feet did get wet but they quickly dried as we hiked. I would highly recommend these. I plan to buy my daughter a pair as well.", "I took these on my vacation to Mexico where we did a 6 hour trek through the rain forest and boy, are these comfortable! The fit was as expected and the colors are as they appear in the photo. I like the subtle blue and that it does not look like a straight up hiking shoe. It is very light weight as well!", "These shoes were comfortable right out of the box. They breathe so are not hot in the summer and are roomy enough for my orthotics. They look good, considering they're a sport shoe. I wear the black ones to work. I liked them so much I bought a second pair and am now even considering a third. Also, they look small. George Clooney, who believe it or not used to sell shoes, says every woman wants to wear a smaller shoe size than she really does.", "Very comfortable hiking shoe. Wore these a bunch and they were super comfortable and light weight. The mesh in upper toe allows sand to get inside your shoes however. Keep in mind if you\u2019re planning to wear these in dry, sandy areas. Had to empty sand from my shoes a few times.", "I already knew I loved Merrell shoes. They are the only brand that doesn't rub my foot in some blister causing way. They were no exception, no blisters, happy to say. They fit great, they are exceptionally light for as much traction as the sole gives. I haven't wanted to take them off since I bought them. About to leave for a backpacking tomorrow and these are the only shes I'm bringing.", "I was hoping they were wider than they were, they were light weight and plenty of arch support. But I will be returning for a larger width. Very good product and would recommend.", "Very comfy. I work on concrete floors and these or my danskos are the only shoes that don\u2019t hurt my feet after all day standing. The mesh parts are great too. It\u2019s hot here in Texas and I appreciate the bit of ventilation they provide", "These shoes are amazing in the water (also on land as well) the traction is great. Very little sediment gets in the shoes and I was walking in muddy sand! Also as they dry they don't get all stiff and bent upwards. Would absolutely recommend for any hiker or trout fisherman :)", "Bought these shoes based on all the great reviews for the Zion Narrows. Hiked the entire trail until the end and back and ended up having the worst blisters that ran the entire length of my feet on my arches. They are great water shoes but tiny rocks kept falling into the shoe and ultimately the stitching at the bottom near my arches are what caused the blisters. I think these shoes would be good for shorter water hikes but were definitely not ideal for the narrows. Wouldn't recommend :(", "These are very comfortable. I walked over 10 miles on pavement one day and my feet were only a little sore. They are also great water shoes that dry fast. HOWEVER, they a DEADLY slippery on wet/smooth surfaces (think river rocks). I wore them on a trek to a waterfall and literally almost died slipping on rocks. I almost ate it on damp bricks in my front yard even.", "The first time I wore these was on a 13 mile hike. They were so comfortable and I didn\u2019t get one blister. They held up through mud, gravel, rocks and water. It says waterproof on the description but my feet def got wet on the hike. They air dried just fine. I ordered my normal shoe size. My feet are very narrow and I feel like these fit amazing. They\u2019re my new favorite.", "I love these shoes, but I wear special inserts because of foot problems. You can't remove the inserts in these shoes, and my inserts don't fit inside without removing those. I still wear these, but if I'm doing a lot of walking I opt for my other Merrell shoes so I can use my inserts.", "Bought these sporty hiking shoes for travel to Kauai. Was interested in a hiking shoe that I could cross rivers in- also having them dry out in a short time and not cause any rubbing or blistering in the process. These shoes were PERFECT! My feet run on the more narrow side, and this shoe, sock-less and with socks, fit perfectly. I wore them without socks on two separate 4 mile hikes and had no complaints. I've also worn them running with socks. It's the perfect do-it-all active travel shoe.", "Excellent shoe. I hike everyday in the desert and these shoes can handle climbing a mountain side to running trails. Super comfortable and appealing. I have three pair. Wearing them everyday and hiking 5-6 days a week, these shoes will last about 5-6 months before there is marked wear. They also wash up beautifully. I hope they never discontinue this style.", "Originally purchased these in my normal size and they were too tight. I went up a half size because I liked them enough to buy again. Super comfortable, breathable and lightweight (which I love for traveling with them). I have not tried them in water, but they are a great summer sneaker.", "Bought these specifically for the Narrows at Zion National Park and these were perfect! We got some neoprene socks to wear with them and had great grip, our feet were comfortable, warmed up quick when out of water, and dried completely overnight after getting soaked all day! We hiked dry trails in these as well and the Gore-Tex sole was perfect for grip while still being nimble. They\u2019re lightweight and comfortable. Love!", "I was so excited to get these shoes because they were an upgrade from my previous ones. Same style. Got them in and the shoe is very narrow. They are made of a cheaper plastic it seems and overall quality is not good. However, they are very light and airy. The toes are a mesh like fiber and let's your feet breathe for sure. I like the old model unifly and wished they still made them.", "Use these for yard work and trail walking. I usually get shin splints easily and my legs bother me, but these have helped tremendously. Holding up well. Hides dirt and stains well.", "These shoes were initially bought for our trip to Zion since we would be hiking through water. They are now my go to trail shoe. Love them. It took no time at all to break them in. Will buy again.", "I bought them for my wife to go hiking in Hawaii, her first pair of Merrells. Now she wears them everyday and loves them. They are incredibly lite, but still very durable. We hiked through mud and streams with no problem. They drained fast and performed perfectly.", "I brought these for my thirteen yr old daughter for sleep away camp. They held up in the rain, mud, rock climbing, and hiking. Idk how they would do long term but they survived summer!", "These saved me on some very rugged hikes in Wyoming this past week. I never felt the rough, rocky terrain beneath my feet and had solid grip through the steep hills. They look nice too!", "I've only worn them a few times. I was hoping they'd be narrower but its not to bad. I like the look and haven't had any soreness in my feet after hiking in them all day. they do have arch support.", "I know it is known to be fore water but what a great shoe for dry land! light, great support, good grip for trails! love them. I ware an 8 and 8 fit great.", "These are the best shoes ever! I love them! They fit perfectly and are very comfortable. I wore them all summer. Not doing the best in the rain and snow but otherwise they are great! I would recommend them for summer hiking and everyday wear.", "Like some other buyers, I missed the fact that these are \"water shoes\" and not \"waterproof\" shoes. I am glad that I did, however. I probably would not have ordered them if I had, and I actually love these shoes. They are lightweight and very comfortable, with a very short break in period. They have a decent sized toe box and a comfortable (non-removable) insole. I have used them for walking, hiking and trail running, and they were up to the task for all three.", "Last minute purchase for a 4 day hike when my tried and tue shoe gave me a blister. They held up amazingly. 20 hours of hiking and they had a great grip. They dried very quickly after river crossings. The arch feels high when I put them on at first but they got great. I normally wear 7-7.5 and I ordered a 7 and they were a good fit.", "I've loved every pair of merrell's I've ever owned. These have been great for me. I live in Michigan, work at an orchard and I'm on my feet all day. These are great cause my feet often get wet and I needed something for the warmer summer months that would dry out quickly. These didn't disappoint. Comfy and true to size.", "I took this on a camping trip - really comfortable. I absolutely LOVE that the toe box area is so roomy, no more cramped tootsies! I wore them in the water too while kayaking. Very sturdy. Great shoes", "This shoe looks and fits great but the mesh makes it useless for any kind of hiking. It allows water and dirt to get in, making them totally uncomfortable and unpleasant to wear. One step in a puddle will sop up your sock and ruin your hike.", "These hiking tennis shoes are the best ever I took them out of the box went for a 10 mile hike it was like walking on clouds !! I highly recommend", "These shoes look very nice but they are not very comfortable I guess because they are water shoes they can\u2019t put much padding in them but every time I wear them I can\u2019t wait to take them off", "Best water shoe for comfort have not used in water been to cold. They look like regular shoes. I wear 7.5 but went to 8 they fit great wore them all day with no pain.", "I love these shoes! I am a size 8, I bought an 8 and they fit perfectly! I got these for hiking. They are comfortable, they have great grip on the bottom for stable footing on rocky terrain. I didn't get any blisters, even while I was breaking them in, I did not have an issues with these shoes.", "Lightweight shoe, breatheable with mesh (aka NOT waterproof) with vibram sole. Seems like perfect warm weather hiker. Not chunky but still substantially sturdier than a running shoe. Like the big toe protector", "These shoes are great for dry land hiking and walking in rocky lakes. My feet feel well protected from shape rocks and they don\u2019t slide on you. They are super easy to clean. I use dish soap then towel and air dry them right when I get home. Don\u2019t put them in the dryer. No funky lake smell after cleaning them. Love them for running in the rain too.", "Feels like a waste of $, after wearing them hiking several times. They slide easily on any surface that isn't perfect, and the fit is okay but there is something wonky about it. Doesn't feel comfortable all over. The toes curl up after use, which leads to a weird look and weirder fit. The pictures don't really show how the shoes look in person and am pretty unhappy with that...Wouldn't recommend at all, get a different hiking shoe.", "shoes look cool, the vibram sole works great, shoes are very light, a little too roomy in the toes area but it doesn't have any negative affect, I would recommend", "I went hiking a week before in some sneakers that had no grip and knew I needed a new hiking shoe for fall. Went hiking after getting these Merrell shoes and it was an awesome experience. They stood up to the 7 mile bearfort trail which includes a ton of terrain, rock scrambles, mud and wetland. These shoes really rocked. I still fell but instead of my usual 40 falls I was down to about 4, which is just due to my terrible coordination. Going hiking and camping again next weekend and am glad I have these Merrell shoes now. They are super cute, fit well and are super comfy.", "This shoe is very comfortable, cleans up well , and can accommodate my custom 3/4 insoles, with thin Spenco insole on top. I ordered a half size larger to accommodate insoles. Highly recommended.", "Love the shoes, my husband has a pair like this and I he loves how they breath and comfortable for long walks. Had to find on Amazon because I have been checking with Merrell for several years and they stopped making these style shoes. Merrell needs to bring back these breathable/vented style shoes!", "I hiked Wheeler Peak in New Mexico with these shoes and they were great. They kept my feet ventilated and dry. I stepped in quite a bit of water on the hike and they dried in no time. Very comfortable and good traction. Some chafing towards the end but that's expected with new shoes. I love these.", "Based on other reviews, I hoped this shoe would be a good, light hiking shoe to replace the version of Siren Sport that is no longer available. I ordered a 10.5--a half size up. The 10.5 was extremely tight. I've ordered this size Merrells for years so I'm surprised at the discrepancy. Also, my test for a good shoe is trying to bend the tip of the shoe upwards. If it bends easily, I don't even bother trying it on. These were very flexible at what would be the ball of the foot--not very supportive for walking and hiking.", "I returned after trying them on. Wasn't a fan of the back and how it was cut. Also the front of the shoe was extremely wide for some odd reason. Other than those things, it was comfortable and I loved the design/color of the shoe. Unfortunately it wasn't what I was looking for.", "I wanted to like these, but in my forest float trip, sediment gets into the shoes when you step in the water, but you can\u2019t get it out unless you take them off and try to scoop it out, which doesn\u2019t work very well.", "I love these shoes and will definitely be buying another pair. They are light and easy to walk in. I hike in them. I don't care about water. I need something light and these fit the bill.", "These shoes are great for hiking and offer amazing support! They are wider in the front so my toes are just a little to loose for my liking.", "These are my favorite walking shoes! I walk several miles everyday for exercise and they are so comfortable. I have had many pairs of these", "I wear size 7 and ordered a 7. They fit perfect. Lots of toe room. I bought them to use riding my off road bike because such small selection of clipless shoes available. These shoes have flat bottom so they work. They are so comfortable, I am thinking about getting another pair for hiking.", "Shoes are perfect. I love Merrell but I ordered men size 7 but was given women size 7. Site was confusing- maybe it was labeled wrong? So disappointed.", "Great shoe, very comfortable. The only thing keeping it from five stars is the durability. The metal grommet for the last eyelet has popped out from the shoe. I don't think these are going to last very long.", "This is my second pair of these little beauties and I am so glad I found them again. They have served me well, from hiking and doing trail maintenance in the US Virgin Islands, to putting in some altitude miles in Glacier National park. This is a lower profile hiking / water trail shoe.... which I wear every day, from yard work to the grocery store. The sole is quite flexible, and the mesh sides help keep my feet cool. The third pic is the pair I am supposed to be replacing, but they aren't going anywhere soon.", "This is my favorite shoe for working out and walking. On average 15 miles per week, this shoe supports my foot, there is no pain, and it's light enough for hot Texas summers.", "Rugged, well designed, and extremely good fit and finish. Spend the money and get these in the color you prefer.", "Buy one size up. I wear a 9, ordered 9-1/2, and they were too small. Gave to my daughter who wears 8-1/2 and fit her perfect. I just ordered size 10 for me.", "I have been looking for a good pair of shoes for a couple of years now. I have probably purchased three pairs of shoes to walk in and all of them rubbed the heels of my feet to the point of blisters. I tried different kinds of socks and nothing worked. So, I took a chance on these and I love them. They fit great and they are lightweight and comfortable. They did not give me blisters!!! I do have to say I wore thorlo socks and I used Hikegoo to aid in the blister prevention. But, I think these will be the ones!", "The shoes fit great. I have a hard time finding shoes that are narrow enough to fit me but these are great. I would not suggest anyone wanting wide shoes to try this style but for me they are great.", "These shoes are great. Very comfortable and no break-in time needed. Excellent grip on wet, slippery and uneven trails. Quick drying after walking in water. I wore them for 8 straight days of hiking our national parks. I did initially send them back for a half size larger but I was planning to wear wool socks so wanted a bigger size.", "I ordered a 9.5 size, usually I am a 9. I like the extra toe space and I am able to wear thick socks. If you wear thin socks a 9 will fit great. I actually have a 9 and a 9.5. They are lightweight, comfortable and let your feet breathe.", "I only have two criticisms of these shoes, and one may just be the way my foot is shaped. The \"ring\" toe on both my feet occasionally scrape against something on the inside of shoe- but not all the time, and not it anyway that is noticeable unless I am paying attention to it. The other is that the grey parts of the shoe (sides, above toes) are mesh, and while this is GREAT at keeping my feet cool, I cannot use them on rainy days, or near streams/rivers. Otherwise, they look great and are super lightweight.", "Fit great. Very stylish. Comfortable. Good in water, ventilation to drain and cool feet. Highly recommend.", "Just finished a hiking trip in Colorado wearing these shoes. They were perfect and exactly what I hoped for. After 5 hours of hiking the mountain side my feet didn't hurt ONE BIT. The shoes were grippy enough so that I never slipped when hiking and breathable so my feet were very comfortable. I would definitely recommend these!", "This is the most comfortable and useful pair of shoes that I own. I normally wear flip-flops and am a bit wider in the to toe, so they give me a little more 'wiggle' room. No rub spots anywhere, great for hiking, good tread for walking in slippery water conditions (caving), and they pack more compactly than my other shoes. I'm getting another pair.", "I bought these sneakers for the support which they have. I get compliments every time I wear them. The colors make them go with everything. Go 1/2 size down - I even put insoles and they fit perfect!", "I liked the shoes and they worked better than expected. Went through a lot of water on my hikes and even with my shoes and socks wet for a bit, it never felt uncomfortable. They were a bit snug and after the hikes the top of my feet hurt and had impressions from the shoes, but I think that's only because they don't come in wide. Still going to be using them.", "I love everything about this sneaker. This is the 3rd pair I've bought. I wear a pair for work and I wear a pair to hike in. They are lightweight, and comfortable. I have issues with corns on my toes and these sneakers don't bother them. The sneaker is flexible and breathable, they dry quickly when they get wet. They are true to size I wear an 8 1/2 and that is what I always order.", "Super comfy water shoes! If you plan to wear all day I would suggest socks but that might just be me! I really like socks and never wear shoes with out them but these shoes are really comfy and dry very fast!", "These shoes are great. Very light and keeps your feet from getting sweaty. They are of great quality and look great. Also very supportive.", "This is my second pair of this shoe and I was worried when I ordered the white but they are beautiful. And since I love this shoe so much and they are no longer being made, I will be ordering a second pair that can be worn on the dirt trails and keep the white pair for my all around walking shoe. The order was handled promptly and delivery occurred the day promised.", "I bought these shoes for a Hawaii trip with plans to wear them hiking and on waterfall explorations. They are amazing! Now that I'm back on the mainland I wear them ALL the time for daily walks/runs and just to wear around. They are super light and even when your feet get wet they don't feel wet. They are amazing and have come to replace my running shoes. When I first tried them on I thought they felt a little short but I kept them and am glad I did.", "These are comfortable but was still slick and made squeaky noise when wet and walking", "Great pair of shoes! Very comfortable. They was delivered when they said they would!", "Surprisingly comfortable! Liked the look. Can't wait to try them out on Kauai jungle hike through water/scrambling.", "These are seriously THE best! It was perfect from going straight from a hike to floating down the river on tubes. Lightweight and so durable. Made very well. I am type 1 diabetic and these shoes were amazing.", "I love these shoes so much I got a second pair in a different color. I\u2019m a nurse, so 12 hour shifts often turn into 14 or 16 hours and these keep me going without pain til about hour 13, but really, find me a shoe that can beat that!!!!", "It was great for 2 months then back stitches came off so I hand stitched to fix it", "Best shoes I\u2019ve owned\u2019. Very comfortable and supportive. I just got a new knee and these shoes Make walking so much better.", "My feet hurt after standing in these for an hour. I tried to like them but it feels like they didn\u2019t finish the shoe. The heel support is terrible and the mesh rubs your skin. My toenails kept getting caught on the top of the shoe when I tried to wear these without socks even though the shoe fit perfectly well. I gave these 2 stars because I thought they looked nice, have a great tread, and are super light.", "I have a wide foot and the regular width was still comfortable. Walked all day through Costa Rica woods and feet felt great.", "These are great for hiking. But also wear in the gym. Just all round nice and comfortable", "Love these shoes!! Great support, wide toe bed, gripping sole, lightweight and breathable. I found that I needed to size up - purchased a size 8 and I normally wear 7-7.5 in other brands. I would recommend these to everyone!", "Put these on for the first time and took a 2 mile, fast paced, hike on a treacherous trail with rocks and tree roots. They grip well. No sign of rubbing or blisters. Very comfortable. Would totally purchase again.", "I love these shoes!!! So cute and comfy! I wore these while I was on a study tour in Israel and my feet did not hurt (when they normally would have).", "These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. I bought them for outdoor water/ hike activities but now I live in them.", "Not a very good water shoe, which is what it's supposed to be used for. The vibram sole gets really slick when wet. Seriously not worth it. And if I don't wear socks the shoes rubs one of my toes raw. I am a freshwater fisheries biologist so I spend s lot of time in rivers. I guess it's back to Keens.", "I wanted a quick drying, well ventilated shoe for hiking in the Summer that also had great arch support. These shoes are perfect. If I don't have good arch support my arches start to hurt, these shoes have been incredibly comfortable.", "These are easily one of my favorite shoes. They are very lightweight and comfortable. They fit true to size and have great traction. I bought them for hiking in the woods but like to wear them for everything. I will buy another pair when I wear these out.", "lots of tread and because they are mesh they breath and my feet don't get so sweaty. wash beautifully.", "Understanding this pair of shoes is made to go into water but i expect more cushioning since we hike rocky trails Also there are 2 bumps inside the shoes beneath my toes, they are bit annoying after dry off pretty quick. small holes on the side which meant to release heat or let water escape. they are good but ......sandssssssss get in pretty easy! there was one time i was hiking in Zion narrows, rushing back to car because it was raining hard thought flash flood might happen. i had to stop a few times to get rid of sands in my shoes but i gave up after and ended up getting blisters.", "These shoes are awesome. I got them and went to Gooseberry Falls State Park with them. Had no problem walking on their trails. I wore them all day long and could have done more than the 8 miles we ended up walking. I love them. Will definitely buy these again.", "So comfy right out of the box! Can be worn with, or without, socks. Bought as a weekend shoe for canoeing and was not disappointed in fir or function. Great shoe for weekend fun!", "I love these already. I have been traveling 30 hours and they still feel great. My feet are not super stinky from wearing them because they are well-ventilated. They have excellent traction and the arch support is the best I have had in a while! I'm looking forward to the rest of this trip with these as my walking shoes!", "Love these shoes! Bought them to use in Jamaica while climbing Dunn's River Falls and they worked great for that purpose. However, I continue to wear them as everyday because they really comfy, well fitting shoes! My feet & I are very happy with this purchase!", "I have bought three pairs of this shoe. I use it for walking, hiking and around town, Comfy and durable a great shoe for the value.", "Excellent shoes, quality, color, confort very good. So please with them.", "So I was going to Oahu and realized my shoes were shot so I needed new hiking shoes. I never had a chance to break these in and I didn\u2019t even need to!! We were doing up to 2 hikes per day and I was comfortable the whole time. No blisters, no weird rubbing, no sore feet with or without socks!! I think they\u2019re incredibly ugly but they\u2019re so comfortable that doesn\u2019t even matter!! Haha", "These are great walking shoes. I put an arch insert in for a little more support and the shes feel light and comfy.", "Best water shoes I've ever had! Survived the whole summer of running around the water park (something a few of my swimsuits couldn't do) and they are still in great condition. (I'm glad I looked them up on that one hiking website.) These will be great for water aerobics too I'm sure.", "These replaced a well-worn pair of Merrells that were about 5 or 6 years old, that I will still use to kick around with in the yard. The food bed is broken down so I wanted a new pair for better support. I was not disappointed. This pair fit like a glove, right out of the box. Great arch support, and super light.", "I bought these shoes to go hiking in the forests of Cambodia and Thailand. I am glad I did, because the traction and comfort were definitely needed as I made my way through rocky paths and had to climb down steep pathways. These saved my footing a number of times. These are airy, too, so my feet weren't overly hot. They did let sand through the aeration holes, but that was an easy fix, just shake them out. I have since worn these hiking several more times, here in the States, and I am finding them to be my go-to shoes for outdoorsy activities.", "Perfect hiking shoes for warm weather- what a difference high quality shoes can provide on rocky trails! Barely can feel sharp egdes of rocks, etc. would buy again", "These are great shoes - I often find myself in tricky situations on the trail, like balancing on a slippery rock in the middle of rushing stream, and these shoes keep me steady and the traction on the bottom is perfect. We were recommended these shoes after looking at waterproof shoes, and the person at Whole Earth said these were better so that the water could drain instead of just sloshing around in your boot if you did happen to get in over the ankle. Perfect pair!", "Comfortable right out of the box. No break in needed.", "Love these wear them all the time breathable great arch support", "For being a water shoe these loose grip pretty easily. I've slipped several time on moist rocks near rivers and it sucks, but these are comfotable if you won't be on dangerous watery surfaces.", "So, I have worn Merrell hiking shoes for years. I loved them when I lived in New England. I now live in Florida and wanted a pair to use on a trip to Costa Rica where I'd have varied terrain, streams, waterfalls, rain forest, dirt and rocky hiking trails. They fit great, and were fine here in Florida breaking them in. The issue is they were advertised for hiking in wet situations. I expected they would drain and dry quickly. They did not. This was a huge dissapointment. Also, when in the waterfalls, they had no grip on the rocks. I will keep them and wear them here but don't buy them for any water environment.", "great sneaker love them so confortable will buy again this is my second pair and another one on the way", "I ordered a 5.5 which is true to size. They're extremely comfortable and look great. I love Merrell shoes, so this is a nice one to add to my collection. I can't wait to go hiking in them.", "I wore these shoes on several long, muddy hikes in Hawaii. Overall they were very comfortable. The soles have great grip, which helped tremendously with hiking the muddy trails. They cleaned up well and dried very quickly.", "Shoes were too small, item returned. Will reorder .5 size larger once credit is received.", "Lightweight, flexible and great arch support. My feet never hurt. Great shoe", "Love these! I wore them for a hike to a beach and they were great! Comfy while still proving support and the bottoms made climbing on rocks and loose gravel seem much easier. They even got super sandy and were very easy to clean off.", "First thing out of the box there was a bunch of glue on the inside seams that I had to take out which was annoying. I have no arch on my feet and these have a slight one, however I've put a few miles on these shoes with no complaints. Also tested them in some trails with slippery conditions on the rocks and they did well.", "This is my second pair. I may even buy a third. Do not wash though....they do shrink enough to be slightly smaller and don't stretch back out. Hence my second pair. I still wear them both though.", "I got these shoes in a very timely manner. The fit is just right with a good pair of thick socks for me. The support is wonderful, as I have plantar fasciitis. They are lightweight and breathe well even with socks on. I like the color, but wish they had the same shoes in my size, in black. They look good and feel good. Glad I found them!", "These are the best Merrell shoes I have. They are lightweight and comfortable, perfect for traveling when I want a light hiking shoe, and sneaker or athletic shoe. I like the way they fit, and look.", "I ordered 1/2 size larger than my usual size - they're fine that way. Merrell makes great shoes and I have several pair now. On my feet a lot during the day on concrete and these are really comfortable. Will be buying more!!", "Super comfortable and lightweight. Used them to hike a few miles and although I experienced slight pain from bad posture of course, it was nothing compared to the immense throbbing and swelling I normally experience. First time wearing them during that adventure and not once did I feel any irritation or scraping. Awesome!", "So far so good...they could have had just a little better arch support as I had surgery for planter fasciitis surgery 6 months ago and it needs a little more support. But do like them.", "Nice water hiking shoe I purchased for The Narrows in Zion, but unfortunately they run small. I\u2019m usually a 7.5 in Nike sneakers, but my toes were unbearably squished in these. I recommend going up a half size.", "Nothing to dislikE,.merril makes fantastic shoes.Rugged wear, great heel and ankle support.it hugs your foot and let\u2019s it expand through an extended amount of time.my wife is very happy with product.we are both loyal to this brand", "These shoes are AMAZING. They are my go to hiking and creeking shoe! They are VERY grippy and SUPER comfortable!! There\u2019s nothing else that I have found that compares! Also I would say they run a TAD small. I would consider going 1/2 size up next time.", "Love these shoes. They do not rub my ankles like some other shoes I have tried. The soles have good grip. Looking forward to wearing them on our trip to Zion and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon", "These are cute and lightweight but seem to run small - I even ordered a half size up, but they felt tight. The arch of the insole felt too far back and pressed annoyingly on my feet. I ended up returning them.", "I love these for hiking! Whether it\u2019s a long or short hike these are great for warm weather and dry very fast. It\u2019s like wearing normal tennis shoes and they have great grip! Very light weight and comfortable.", "I wear a size 11 and I had to return these because they were too small. Super bummed they don\u2019t offer a size 12! Great shoe and great quality just too small.", "Perfect fit. Super comfortable. However slightly slippery on wet surfaces. Would not recommend in slippery conditions. Something I have a concern with hiking in the PNW. But I do wear these at work with long hours on my feet. No blisters. However they do dry super fast.", "Very lovely shoes, but a bit too wide in the front...", "Hiked 8 Miles at the Grand Canyon in these shoes straight out of the box and they felt great! I wore socks since I had never worn them and I could not have asked for a better fit. These handled steep & rocky hills going down and back up. Highly recommend and great for the price.", "Little support. Not appropriate for a foot with 2nd toe longer than big toes because of the slanted toe box. Very disappointing.", "I love them. They fit perfectly and they are extremely comfortable to walk the whole day. I went to a 2week trip to Europe where I walked the whole day every day and I was really glad that I bought them before the trip.", "I thought these shoes were comfortable but too small. I am a true 10 in every shoe I own, except Nike those run small. My toes were touching, I would recommend sizing up at the least a half size if not a full size. I do like the look of them though.", "I love the look and style and purchased them for an ECO trip in the tropics. Despite ordering a half size larger than usual they were still very short. I returned them. The arch didn't feel right for me either. Try a full size larger. Like I said they look good.", "Great shoes usually wear 9 had to go up a half size . Size 9 rubbing against toe other wise love the arch support", "stiff but fit great , not exactly like the pair I bought in the store , but close.", "I love Merrill shoes!

I almost cried when I had to throw thwm out because I left them out and they were damaged :(", "I wear a size 9 so thats what I ordered. Will try an 8.5. Love Merrell and the shoes are gorgeous!", "These shoes are the best. With the weather getting nice I have been trying to take the dog for longer walks and no matter what athletic shoe I buy my feet are screaming half way through. I love my \"winter\" Merrells so just took a shot. First day out I went twice as far with no problem. So supportive and comfortable, my search is over. I have a very narrow foot so did have to cinch them up a bit but other than that the fit was excellent.", "These are great shoes. I work in a clinic and am on my feet most of the day. These shoes keep my feet cool and happy. Loved them so much, got myself a pair for the gym.", "Very lightweight exactly what I needed. They are true to their size.", "This shoe is awesome! They have incredible traction which gave me great confidence while climbing the rocks; They are definitely quick drying after stepping in water spots along the trail. I scraped the shoes several times on the rocks, and the material of the shoe ihandles the abuse well. The fit was perfect and comfortable. I will definitely try other Merrell shoes. These were perfect for summer hiking!", "I bought these for hiking in the UK and they were great! They're comfortable and didn't take long to break in. This is now my favorite pair of hiking shoes. The tread is good without making the shoes clunky, and they aren't heavy so they weren't a hassle to pack. Definitely hooked!", "Nice fitting and were great to have on the trails in Arizona this last fall.", "Time will tell. I got tired of walking through my tried and true brand every six months so I took a chance on these. I like them a lot in terms of style and comfort. I walk about 4 plus miles per day and am hopeful that these will last at least a year.", "Held up through a Spartan Race, which, in my opinion is the ultimate test for any shoe. Mud, muck, water, rocks, and steep terrain. These are comfortable and durable. Ordered a second pair.", "Wear this shoes all day at work, walking around the hospital.", "I think they run a little small since I bought my usual size and toe rubbed on the inside....", "These shoes are perfect for trail running. I wanted to really try them out for a while before giving a review and they are excellent hiking, trail, and outdoor shoes. Compared to my other shoes, these definitely grip the ground when going up loose gravel and rock and have prevented me from slipping numerous times.", "I love it for hiking and all other sports activities I do. They lose form a little after washing in a washing machine, but I guess that's normal. Color works with any clothing.", "They fit as expected. I normally wear a size 8 but ordered an 8.5 after reading previous reviews. I wore them all day expecting to break them in before a hike but it wasn\u2019t necessary as they were comfortable the minute I put them on.", "Great shoes, though I experienced some toe jamming on my last hike with them (7 miles). I would recommend for moderate and more flat hikes. Otherwise light-weight, comfortable. I have a high instep and experienced some pressure on one foot about 3 hours into our hike.", "Very easy to wash, no sand holding folds inside. Sturdy and stylish. Comfortable.", "I put these shoes on out of the box and forgot I had new shoes on until I took them off to shower 8 hours later. VERY COMFORTABLE SHOES! Hoping to eventually get them in brown but love the purple.", "I bought these to go hiking in a wet area. I chose not to wear socks with them as I would be in the water. They were perfect. They are not waterproof as they are mesh. They do dry quickly. I wore these all day hiking with no socks in wet areas and my feet had no blisters. I would recommend these shoes!", "I used these for hiking and going into the river . They worked great . My favorite pair of water shoes", "I found the toe box is a little small and I've had to put moleskin/band aids on both big toe joints to protect my skin when my foot flexes during gait. I'm hoping this shoe will break in a bit more in the front of the shoe. Otherwise, the size is fine and I like the general appearance of this shoe.", "My wife uses these as boat shoes on a racing sailboat and are the best she has ever worn. Soles will not mark deck", "I LOVE LOVE LOVE these shoes. I can't wait to buy more in other colors. I'm a teacher so I'm on my feet most the day and love them at the end of every day.

You can wear them with or without socks depending on the activity.", "LOVE THESE!! The backs stay nice too (Mine always are squished after a while...not these though)", "No break in time, super grippy, extremely breathable, and laces keep tied. Only suggestion is your going to want some insoles. Headed to Southern Utah to hit up the National Parks and I'm excited.", "Love these shoes!! Very comfortable. Dry fast. If you are also hiking in a dusty area, the dust will get in the shoes and on your feet.", "Love these hiking shoes! I wore them wherever I hiked and they were comfy, sturdy and dried quickly. I wore them when I hiked the mountain trails to and on Machu Picchu, and they were great to walk in!

I'll update my review after. I'm a consistent size 8 and 8 fits well. They feel like they will not need a break in period. Quite flexible and comfortable right out of the box.", "I have problems with the arches of my feet and I work on my feet a lot. Since wearing these shoes, I've had very little problems. I'm thinking about picking up another pair.", "I absolutely love Merrells and am a multi-Merrell owner. These fit like a glove and are super comfortable. I'm certainly going to get another pair. The size was true to your size (I got and 8 1/2), no defects and fast shipping.Thanks!", "These are my new go-to hiking shoes.

They dried extremely quickly, required no break-in period, kept our feet cool. We could not have asked for more.", "I haven't bought a new pair of hiking water shoes in a long time.

VERY sturdy & comfy I must say. 5 stars from me!", "So light and comfortable. Took them on my trip to Utah for a week of hiking. Perfect", "These are the best creek and water fall shoes. Good for packaging too!", "Amazing and comfy! I had plantar fasciitis and started wearing these and within 1 week, all symptoms were gone! Love these shoes!!!!", "My feet are pretty picky about shoes, but they love these. I've worn them hiking, white water rafting, tubing and just hanging out and they have been comfortable in every situation. Even when wet and sock less they are comfortable to wear and don't rub or blister. They dry fast enough to not get funky as well. Great shoes and I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for a versatile pair of shoes.", "Though I wouldn't wear them for running, they're very comfortable to wear all day walking. Cute colors too, but would love the All Out Blaze in all black.", "Seeing everyone has said the exact same thing I would have, I just had to put in my \"2 cents\" and agree with all the great reviews. Already have 2 fellow hikers wanting to order them!!", "I love these hiking/water shoes. I was a little nervous taking them on my trip without the opportunity to break them in.

Was looking for something light weight, quick to dry, and good for the outdoors and met my match.", "Best hiking/water shoes to date! I like it best because it's lightweight unlike my hiking boots and I have no problem crossing streams. It doesn't weigh me down when it's water logged and I found it to dry faster.", "I have 30-40 Merrell shoes and all were 8.5. These said 8.5 but were at least a size smaller. I don\u2019t know if it was a manufacturers mistake or They are making them that small.", "I had a pair of merrells of a similar style so I chose the same size. Fit perfect. No breakin time needed. Cool. Cute. My feet love these.", "I have been looking for a hiking shoe that isn't giant and is cute for a long time. I just got these today and they are perfect. They have very good arch support and are very lightweight.", "I'm disappointed for tge money 110.00 my shoe should not gave come broken", "Favorite trail shoes for hiking by far, excellent breathability. These shoes are like AC for your feet. Only (to be expected) downside is that ankle gaiters are almost useless because your feet are going to pick up dust and dirt from the trail. I have also used these on several 6 mile day hikes without socks for top notch breathability without any blisters! Even better, I don't hesitate to walk through water with these because I know my shoes will safely dry by the next day on the trail.", "Love my shoes. They are similar to the last ones I wore out.", "Love the shoe but it\u2019s a summer shoe. Don\u2019t order it expecting it to work in snow.", "These are perfect.

Needed very little 'breaking in'.", "Breathable and true to size! The color is fantastic and just as pictured! You can not go wrong with these shoes!", "Home run with these lightweight shoes. A cross between a hiking shoe and a vented water shoe, these are great for strenuous walking on hills. I am going to order a second pair for the top shelf of the closet, ready when needed!", "Loved everything about these shoes, just need to get a pair that is a half size smaller because they seem to run bigger on me, so I decided to try the All out blaze water shoe. Very cool looking and comfortable as well!", "I love these shoes. From my kayak to the bike trail. Perfect for both!", "STOP your search for the perfect lightweight, supportive and all out fantastic summer/water hiking shoe! These are the best.", "Love these shoes! They are comfortable, breathable, and look great! I get compliments all the time.", "Shoes are good quality, but it shouldn't be that hard in 2016 to follow standard sizing. I wear a 5.5 which means I almost always have to order a 6. In these, the size 6 is a full size too small.", "Very nice shoe...I usually wear a9 or 9 1/2 but I shoulda ordered a ten as the 9 1/2 is too short! Nice colors!!", "Love the shoes, exact to size, has a lot of room in to box, feels like I am wearing slippers! I am buying another pair!", "This is my 3rd pair of this style.

I bought my first two years ago, and they still look good despite wearing them constantly! Definitely worth the money!", "Merrell Shoes are a brand I trust. I wore the last pair for over (2) years. This shoe offers good support but I do wear socks with reinforced insoles. If you are on your feet all day, you will love this shoe.", "V nice design... comfort & functionality... many compliments! not big and clunky... good support... of course they are no longer being made!", "These shoes were SO comfortable to stand in, and if you plan on wearing them with socks (or water socks), I imagine they would be perfect. However, the mesh lining goes underneath your foot a little and I found it to be incredibly uncomfortable without socks, which is how I need to wear them for my excursion in Jamaica. I tried to make them work, but with my sensitive feet, I could barely walk across the room before taking them off. I really wanted to love them, but returned them for the sandal version - those have essentially the same support, just without the mesh.", "Beautiful shoes, but note the very narrow toe box and get a half size bigger.", "this is my second pair and I love them, they are great for someone who has a bigger big toe than the other toes:) I should have bought 2 more pairs for fear they will not make them anymore", "Great product and definitely worth the money.

I wear a size 9.", "I love these shoes, this is my fifth pair, on my feet all day", "Love Merrells, and these are no exception. They fit great with a roomy toe, wear well, look nice, and are functional. These are mesh, so they can get wet. Wear socks, though, to make them more comfortable across the top of your foot.", "I love that they are light weight, water proof, but also great for hiking through terrain!", "Length and width are okay with an orthotic insert. My problem is long big toes which need more height in the toe box. I can feel constant pressure on the toe nails from the top of the shoe. I have lost toe nails several times due to this problem.", "I was wanting a pair of light hiking shoes and did some extensive research. These shoes are amazing! Fit true to size, comfortable from the first wear, and lightweight. I initially bought them for hiking, but now wear them all of the time!", "Great warm weather hiking shoe! Ordered a half size larger based on reviews and that was perfect with my orthodox. Great toe room and worked wonderfully my hike in Mt. Rainier.", "perfect will buy more again,the best I have ever used", "Fits perfect I highly recommend. I wear a size 7.5 and this size was a perfect fit. Note my feet are not wide. Not to sure how good they are in wet slippery conditions but great for a rocky desert terrain.", "No break-in time. Put them on and wore them all day to the Fair.

The shoes fit well and we true to size. We hiked for 4-6 hours per day for 3 days and the shoes were still comfortable. We also went through The Narrows, where we treaded through knee-deep water for a few hours, and the shoes help up well! At the end of the day, we left the shoes outside overnight and they were dry again the following morning! She also noted that many hiking shoes do not look good, but these were a bit more stylish and cute. This is a good shoe that will protect your feet from the elements!", "Amazingly comfortable and light!!

I was a bit apprehensive about the price, but these shoes are definitely a great value, all things considered.", "These shoes have been worn before.

I called and left messages, to no avail.", "When my shoes arrived there was mud caked into the bottom of them. These are not advertised as used.

The toe isn\u2019t a normal rounded toe, it is angled.", "They're comfortable, great traction but I wasn't a fan of how much dirt/sand got in through the mesh.

I would definitely buy these again.", "Went hiking in Manie and my shoes were so comfortable", "best sneakers I've ever had, and believe me, I've worn many over the years! I'm ordering another pair!", "Bought these for my girlfriend and while we haven't really put them through their paces yet (we're going take these to Zion next week) she finds them very comfortable. Took them for a hike the other day and she was sad that they were dirty afterwards because she really likes the color. Our only problem with these is that they run a half size too big. I experienced this issue with mine as well that I purchased outside of Amazon. She's a 6 in every other shoe and needed a 5.5 in these. I'm normally an 11 in every other shoe and I needed a 10.5 in these.

Lightweight and comfortable right out of the box.", "I would have loved these if they ran true to size. Taking it out of the box, I was happy with the weight of these shoes. The only problem was that they apparently run a half size too small or something. It is almost as if the outside of the toe area slopes too much. My 4th toe (only the 4th) rubbed. (Never have had that problem before.) Plus, the shoes did squeak as I walked around my house. I am sure they wouldn't have done that on the trail, but any other surface...", "Were comfortable right out of the box. Can\u2019t wait to wear them on my trip to CO!", "Love these shoes!

So comfortable and airy for my feet to breath!", "Flexible and comfortable with all the support needed for local trails.", "Comfortable right out of the box. Sizing is right for me.

Perfect for all my outdoor adventures.", "I had to order 1 full size larger than I usually wear but once I got the right size I love them!", "Love the look and the fit seems good.

Have trekked through water with yet, but I'm sure they will be great. Great grip. Very lightweight.", "These are extremely comfortable shoes. They were a little bigger than expected but are very comfortable and good for hiking/walking. I wore them on a long hike right out of the box and they did not give me any blisters or discomfort. Love these shoes!", "Toe box was way too wide. I have Merrell shoes and these fit completely differently.", "Fit like a glove out of the box.

I wish I had saved the box because I'd send them back .", "I have several pair of Merrell hiking shoes that are wonderfully supportive and comfortable. I ordered this shoe in the same size as the others. This shoe feels \"soft\" and is very large in front, toe area. By the time I had it laced up the fabric portion of the front had gathers.Even the ankle support is less than in my other Merrell shoes. I have a narrow foot and would not recommend this shoe to anyone who wants a supportive hiking shoe, especially if you have slender feet. Unfortunately I had thrown out the shipping box they came in or I would have returned them.", "Roomy toebox, great arch support. It seems like these will dry quickly with all the mesh around, but the support is fantastic. Went for a hike and no break-in period needed! Sole is SUPER grippy, even on wet rocks.

I plan to buy them again, but 1 size larger. I really love the shoe...", "Wow. I have been hiking in Adidas Boosts for some time now, and these Merrells blow them out of the water. Great arch support, super lightweight, thin breathable covering that's supportive. I want to wear these everywhere. The ankle areas are rather deep cut, so less ankle support, but great range of movement. I'm regularly an 8.5, and they fit true to size, though they are just barely long enough. The display picture makes them look chunky and kind of like a skater sneaker, fortunately they look way better in person.", "These shoes would have been great if not for the large 8.5 size. Normally 8.5 is my size, but these particular shoes run big. Loved the style and the venting mesh.", "Comfortable right out of the box. Can't wait to wear these on my hike.", "I've had a pair of these for a year and love them so much I bought another pair in case they they wear out and are discontinued. They are light and airy but durable. The toe box is wider. I have an issue with my right big toe and this shoe works well for me. If it rains or I step in a deep puddle my socks get wet but can dry quickly as well if not soaked. The tread is good for all kinds of hiking and they were comfortable right out of the box. I hope this one is never discontinued. I also really like the blue color.", "I have had another pair of these and they are great. Comfortable and great traction.

Perfect for hiking", "I hiked into Havasupai Falls my first time wearing them and it was a 10 mile hike in. I was the only one not to get any blisters.

Merrells are the only shoe I can almost always count on to fit correctly.", "I really like these shoes. I tried them on at a local store and found on Amazon for a cheaper price. I was so excited! I ordered the same size I tried on in the store (sz 7). Unfortunately, the shoes I received have my toes right at the end. Of course I was not so bright and wore them anyway, thinking maybe it was thicker socks, not the case. I wish I had the 7.5!! Other than that, I love these shoes and wear them when I am lifting weights and working out!", "These shoes are the most comfortable I have ever owned.", "I used these for hiking where we were going through the water. I would not want to hike all day in these but the grip was decent (not as good as my hiking shoes) but still decent and the best part was that they dried REALLY quickly so I could wear them the next day to hike and they were not stinky. I am glad I go these. But I did buy a 1/2 size bigger than I normally wear and I do have a wide foot.", "Love these!! Very comfortable, I have a wide and flat arch and merrel's always feel great.

Will work well for hiking in areas where feet may get wet.", "Great shoes but the size runs small. I love the shoes so much that I ordered a bigger size", "These shoes had a weird fit to them which I did not expect from Merrell.

Other then that I think their a good water shoe with great support.", "Got these for the GF, had to return for lager size due to smaller than usual fit.

Any water that comes in contact quickly dries up and I can wear them all day with no issue.", "I have never taken anything but a size 7 in my 52 years of life.

I ordered a size 8 and they are a little small my toes are right in the end. Normally I wear a 7.5-8. The shipper dj's shoes sent me two sheets of stickers with my shoes wich I think is awesome! The shipping was fast and hassle free I'm definitely thinking about ordering another pair.", "Instant comfort!! These have now become my go to camping shoe!", "Comfortable from the moment I put them on. Plenty of room in the toe area, plan on wearing socks, so this is not an issue. Dries quickly, great \"portage\" hiking shoes. Great soles for hiking or in water with rocks. Protect toes from injury.", "LOVE these shoes!! Just got them and wore them on 2 short hikes and they felt great. My feet are small but a little on the wide side and these had plenty of room to accommodate swelling, but tight enough to provide enough support. I really like the flexibility and grip when hiking up and down a steep incline and can't wait to see if they work just as good hiking through water. I totally recommend these shoes!", "If I could do two and a half stars I would. If you have plantar fasciitis, these shoes will not help. There is essentially no support aside from in the side arch which is as hard as a rock. They are grippy on regular, non wet flooring. But anything wet and it doesn't grip. I cannot imagine hiking across a creek with mossy rocks in these. I also can't imagine hiking in these. Meh. Just meh. Cute and ok for average wear. I wouldn't dare hike in or wear these more than a few hours.", "I love these shoes but you really need to go up 1/2 a size. I wear 7 1/2 in running/hiking shoes. I should have gotten size 8. Would not be able to go on long hike with this size.", "I actually ordered these shoes because I thought that they were waterproof (guess I didn't read the details well) and would be perfect for my disc golf game with all the hiking that we do. Although they aren't waterproof they are perfect and when my feet got wet they dried very quickly and were not slushy inside. I really love these shoes!", "Perfect shoe for quick scrambles up any terrain. Lightweight yet steady with good traction even on slightly muddy trails. Might be ideal for dry conditions due to mesh upper.", "I love these shoes; my only criticism is that they have NO TRACTION in wet areas-- you will slide on a moppy floor.", "Arch support is better than expected. Shoes are lighter in weight than expected (which is excellent!). Can't wait to wear when we go hiking in water ways.", "They we're nice but not what I was looking for.

They are comfortable and a great fit, but they sound like literal clown shoes. Did anyone from Maelstrom try wearing a pair of these? It's ridiculous how bad they squeak.

Seriously, how can this company not address such an obvious design flaw.", "I have had a lot of boots of the years, both tactical and steel toed work boots. I wanted a new tactical pair for shooting and I am very disappointed with these. I decided to get them because of the reviews, I think they are fake reviews because these boots are the most uncomfortable boots that I have ever purchased. It is actually kind of weird, When I put them on they feel great but then I walk around and its terrible. Pros: Easy to put on material seems to be good price Non-slip grip is great Cons: REALLY uncomfortable The toe is too narrow and causes a lot of rubbing no arch support", "Fell apart after 2 months of very light use. Perhaps used them 5 times. First the strings holding out sole to the body started unraveling. I figured out how to shoe glue that down before it lost too many stitches. Then the leather at the lace point on one boot just disintegrated leaving a gaping 3 inch hole in the side. It is not even on a seam point.

I work in an office everyday haven't been doing any hard Ruck marches or field exercises. No rock climbing or anything. I walked from my house to my car and for my car into the office. Maybe cuz they're zipper sides I don't even have them tied very tightly. Because office work. One of the eyelets for the laces has already come free and just tearing through the leather. I can't imagine what would happen to the boots if I wore them for actual field training. Maybe I should have known better. Maybe you actually do get what you pay for. But I would not buy these again", "Great inexpensive boots for motorcycling. I would recommend to secure the straps with cable ties (see photo, better get black cable ties though). Boots with straps are usually not a good idea for motorcycles because they can catch on the shift lever, but you can manage them with cable ties as mentioned. Fortunately you can get in and out of these boots by just opening the zipper. Other than that they are comfortable, fit true to size and the sole is really soft like the sole of sports shoes.", "I defiantly disagree that these run big.. I usually wear a 11 or 11.5 wide, and I ordered an 11 W based on answers here, but the toe box was so narrow that I could barely squeeze my foot in; and that was after taking the laces almost completely off and working and stretching them to try and loosen them up.. I had to go back and look at the box and read the label several times to make sure it was an 11W.. and the labels confirmed.. I'd probably have to go to a 12 or 13 W to get one to fit, but I'm just returning and trying something else.. too bad.. they looked like great deal", "I work in a prison, and it's tough fi doing light weight boots for summer use. The under armour boots are more like high top sneakers that provide no toe protection or protection from the rain. This boot for the money is perfect.

UPDATE: I worked 8 shifts, not even doubles, before the insole separated from the foot-bed, the laces self destructed and the padding under the heels is already hammering down. UPDATE 2: Amazon was on point sending a replacement pair with pre-paid return shipping. Maybe I got a bad pair, will try the second pair of boots.", "The pair I received had a large blotch of glue on the side of the shoe. A manufacturing defect from gluing the inner and outer layers together. Besides that I tried them on and my feet immediately hurt. I wear a size 14 and these were a bit tight. They also conform your foot to weird shape, pulling my toes upward. I do not recommend, sending back for refund.", "Well first of all these either came without a sole or the sole was incredibly cheap. Either way the boot felt horrible. The toe box was way to tight... I ordered a size up just in case it was going to be tight... it was still tight. The width wasn\u2019t wide at all... they are pretty tall and bulky minus the comfort. Idk why you\u2019d want to wear these. The construction seems pretty decent with them though and customer service did issue me a refund so I\u2019ll give them 2 stars. Otherwise horrible experience with these boots. Sticking to Bates from now on for my duty boots. It didn\u2019t pay to try and save a quick buck here.", "While not waterproof, have an amazing amount of resistance and amazing traction and support. I got blister on side of big toe, but did NOT break them in before Bryce Canyon. Since then, they have been amazing! Very comfortable, very supportive, weather resistant (rain/puddles), and comfortable. Well worth the price. I do NOT wear them daily for work, but during inclement weather in Florida and light hiking. THey are NOT work boots. They are for the occasional hiker like me and for inclement weather. Great value!!!! I wear 3-4 days per month.", "So far I've been wearing these for working around the house and working out. Yes, I work out in them. Sometimes I wear them as a casual boot. I bought these for a Live Action Costume so I didn't plan on using them every day, but 4 months later they are still the most comfortable footwear I have. At this point the velco has become useless but that doesn't bother me at all. I may either replace it or just leave it.", "I've had the boots for 3 months now. The zipper just broke one by one boot. I wear them daily and I work behind a desk. The durability isn't there. I guess I will give back to my 511 boot. Update: so I went with one more pair just in case the previous pair were bad. well after a couple of months with the new pair, zipper broke once again. Needless to say, definitely not buying these again.", "overall the price and quality is the best compromise for these boots. within two months started only zipping boots 3/4 of the way down, because if i went the whole way down the zipper would get stuck. 3 months in one velcro section completley fell off. other than that for 50 bucks these things are holding up great, make my feet feel great, still look good, and i happily put them on every work day. excellent boot for the price, and continue to work for me 6 months in, and wearing them every work day.", "I have bought only a handful of boots in my past. I was issued most of those... the comfort, durability and style are high in my standards and are well met and exceeded in my TAC FORCE boots. I went from a stylish pair of footwear at my workplace on Fridays...we are permitted to wear sneakers, I went for rugged class.

Great pair of tactical boots for close to \u201chome missions. Thanks! Delton", "These boots are comfortable right out of the box and still comfortable after 8 months of use. They are not indestructible though. I used them daily for riding on a motorcycle, hiking, work(light duty standing 8-10hrs), and during the winter in Upstate NY. They worked well for all, however I believe the transition from cold and wet to heating in the car/drying at home ultimately killed the lifespan of these boots. They are separating at seams and the sole. I liked them well enough that I will probably get another pair for the price, however I will not be using them during the winter in hopes of getting more than 8 months out of them.", "I bought these for my husband that works as a flooring installer. The bottom is a gum sole so they don\u2019t mark up floors. They are lightweight and flexible for construction workers who cannot wear a steel toed shoe but want the ankle support. He spends his days bending down and these are what is needed. The price was perfect!", "I've been wearing these boots (Size 13) for 8 months now. They still look good and are still comfortable. They take a shine well and hold it for days with just a quick buff. The size was right on with what I would buy in the store. The bad, the interior doesn't hold up well and the fabric around the zipper has a tendency to get stuck in the zipper. Without that flaw, I would have given 5 stars. EDIT: I have had the boots 11 months now and while shining them today I noticed the sole was separating from the upper. I wore them every day to work, mostly inside but also some outdoor use.", "PROs well made, thick skin, stiffish but compliant, supportive, zipper is heavy duty, sole provides really good traction CONs Arrived a little snug fitting but one good hike and they loosen up to size I try and go one size bigger so I can add another layer of foam because I tend toward planar fascitis. These boots are good but I am glad I ordered a size up, they are comfy and supportive but I wanted the extra cushion for my messed up feet. A great bargain, I will seek these out again when these wear out which seems like it will take some years to do", "These boots are great for Police and EMS. They are waterproof, slip resistant, and good looking. I love the side zipper feature that allows quick application. They seem to be holding up very well for the month that I have been wearing them in touch conditions. My feet are always warm too! That is the huge shocker, normally as soon as I step out of the station or ambo, my feet are freezing. Not with these boots, they stay very warm and dry.", "UPDATE BOOTS DISNT EVEN LAST A FULL YR.. SOLES CAME APART ANS THE BOOTS ARE NOW UNWEARABLE. BUYER BEWARE I was a bit skeptical on getting these boots but i must say i was very surprised by the fit and feel. I use these 6 days a week and I have to admit they are very comfortable. Easy on / off because of the side zipper and they are defiantly non slip . Only thing I would change is the shoe laces.. they're very skinny and feel like Every time I pull on them they will break. Other than that I see no cons. UPDATE.. shoes only lasted 5 months before the soles started to separate from the shoe itself.", "I wish I had discovered these boots 5 years ago. I have spent much more money on more famous brands and not experienced the fit and performance that I have with these boots. My foot actually feels cradled by the boot. They are surprisingly light weight and even though they are an 8\" boot they go on much easier then my previous 6\" Bates and 5.11's. They are well worth the money and then some! This will not be my last pair. 09/05/20 9 months later and the comfort and performance is still top notch!!", "I am lucky that I do not have a wide foot or these boots would not have fit properly. I recommend that one should order a size LARGER to have enough room for wear. I love the side zipper. I've had these boots for a month. I wear them every day for work. If they get soiled, I simply brush them with a stiff bristle brush and they are ready for use again. I highly recommend \"Lock Laces\" for the boots. They will eliminate a great deal of time that one spends with regular laces on every wear. These are a good bang for the dollar, IF, one does not have a WIDE foot.", "Pros: very comfortable for long wear, breathable, good sole, price for value is excellent Cons: order half to full size up to accommodate good socks, polishable part is easily scratched/damaged/scuffed So, we read the reviews and ordered a size up and they fit welk, but a little snug with thick socks (stuff I got in the military for hikes). The polishable part was heavily damaged quicker than expected. Used them for about 5 months now and the tops are scratched and worn so badly that I must replace them. Activity included walking about 3-4 miles 5-6 days per week, sitting, and driving. The sole is also separating in areas.", "the boots are awesome but they only lasted 1 1/2 mos, the inside soles wore out fast, the price i paid is not worth it. i tryed to put in for an exchange as they didn't last but 1 1/2 mos & i was unable too so i'm out my money & the boots as my husband can't wear them now.", "Boots ran almost half a size too big, but otherwise, the quality is great. I've fixed the size issue by adding gel inserts and arch supports, and the boots are perfect now. I love the soles. It sounds funny, but I've patrolled through gravelly floor and greasy floors in the same night, but the boots made me confident in traversing through them. I've had boots before that were $60, but the rivets were falling out and the pair wore out in no time. The high reviews here seem well earned.", "They lasted for about 7 months straight. I wore these boots only, so they definitely got plenty of wear and tear. I didn\u2019t use them strenuously, like for hiking or anything, just normal wear. The leather did rip from the front side of my right boot, exposing my sock. The zipper worked perfectly and have had no issues. i don't remember how they were before but I can honestly say these boots are NOT slip resistant, in fact, I can guarantee you'll slip if not careful. Also at one point they started squeaking every time i took a step, i didn\u2019t mind since they sounded Like a pair of old leather boots. Honestly, the sound made my presence known :p", "These are very well made boots. The zipper is very good quality as with the rest of the construction of the boots. Great ankle support and very sturdy stance. I replaced the laces they came with - with paracord as is the norm and they are a really great fit for the price. Very comfortable even though they still need a little breaking in after a week of daily wear. If i were getting them wet I think they would break in quicker. Wear thicker boot socks with them or they might seem a bit loose. I am very happy with them.", "I have had these shoes since October of 2017. Almost 2 years and finally there is a tear in front where it folds. I have used this almost everyday for 2 years and the sole is still in good shape with good grip and groves. Well worth the money and lightweight. Since the front is suede if you run a hose on it for a few minutes then it gets wet but otherwise no issues and was great in winter. Even with the tear I still wear it as it is very comfortable. After about a year I added a pair of Dr. Shoals and it was even more comfortable. Will add a photo soon.", "I purchased two sets of boots , different brands in October. These boots Fit good but there were several damaged lace eyelets so I returned them and a replacement set was sent. I was already wearing the other set of boots so when my replacement boots showed up I gave them a once over and threw them in the closet. Now 4 months latter I pull them out to start wearing them. So they didnt feel right. Took me a second to realize they were two different sizes. Left boot was a size 11 and the right boot was a size 12. Return window has long closed for me and that\u2019s my fault.", "Bought these for my husband quite awhile ago. I will purchase them again. He has problems with his ankles and needed a higher shoe for support. He loves these as they have really fit been what he has needed. The price was really great too.. He is an RN and is on his feet for 12 hour shifts. He has really appreciated these boots in every way. I will be ordering them again soon. They have worn well over I think 2 years. Great value!", "Have worn these boots for 3 hours every week for less than 4 months (Equivalent to one week of work) and the seam on the tongue is coming apart. Would have expected them to last longer than that before they started to come apart. I contacted Maelstrom customer service about the stitching coming apart. They asked for a photo and order information. After I sent it they sent me a new pair of boots. Customer service as great! We'll see how long this pair lasts.", "Bought these for work and they are great. So far have been wearing good and they are easy to put on and take off with the zippered and felcro opening. Saves tons of time having to lace up and un-lace every time you take you put them on or take them off. Comfortable and the cushions inside come out for easy cleaning so you can wash out foot odor and dirt if need be.", "These boots are so comfortable and really take a beating. Great traction, very breathable. I wore them all all last week cutting and splitting wood. They really held up. And you really can't beat the price for a good quality boot! I just ordered another pair for my son and he has a size 13-14 show size. i am very surprised that they have so many sizes to choose from and the price stays the same no matter what size you pick, unlike some other shoes. I will probably order another pair myself just to have.", "Great price, waited nearly 3 months for shippment Arrived, initially fit snug but knew they would adjust, day 3 of work in dirt and the toe flex point tore open leather tore at point where boot flexes after use the sole has weakened and boot has widened out Not worth the wait or even price", "LOVE these boots. Bought for husband and also as a gift for our loyal UPS man for Christmas. Both love them, swear by the comfort and love the tie first to set how they like the laces and then zip afterwards and not retie again! The only complaint, and it's just one, is that they don't last long. Our UPS guy walks A LOT and my husband is seriously rough on shoes working in the woods, shop and is very hard on all his shoes. I think for the price these are a great boot and if you are rough on shoes, like me, you'll buy a new pair annually with a smile.", "I have two complaints with these boots. 1. As other reviewers have said, they don't really work as non-slip shoes. I feel like i'm on ice when I wear these in the restaurant I work at. 2. The laces are slippery enough that they don't stay tied tightly with a regular bow like most normal laces will. This can be solved by spending $1 at Wal-Mart to get new laces, but still. I would give these shoes 5 stars if they weren't being marketed as non-slip, but they don't live up to the expectations the ad creates for the buyer.", "Second pair. Light weight. Love the side zipper. These are back yard, nail pounding, riding lawn mower, brush dragging boots. Not water proof, not 82nd Airborne, or cross the Kalahari boots. They are boots that are easy to put on, easy to move in, and look good at Home Depot. I have climbed a tree with rope and spurs in them and did nick the toe with my Stihl and they protected my feet. I wear a 10 to 10.5 and these fit snug at 10.5", "Pros - Comfortable Cons - Wore them on one trip to Ethiopia and already the sole is coming loose on one of the boots. This may have been a defect from the get go but I was replacing boots that I've worn there for at least ten years that have started to separate in the same place. Other than the defect they seem like good boots.", "I knew reading the reviews these boots are not waterproof- not even close. Comfortable to wear when its dry out. Easy on, easy off. I have only wore them twice for a total of 6 hours. My feet did get a little sore but that's probably due to break in time. Given the price, I really don't expect these boots to last more than a year- time will tell. Would buy again.", "product is not as slip resistant as i would like. the rubber compound is harder and more dense. pretty good for concrete or asphalt or a woodland boot but cant compare to bates in terms of non slippage. on a shop floor these can get you into trouble pretty quickly. they slip and slide when contacted with water on any painted surface or certain types of water repeling surfaces. they are good boots but the rubber is bad at keeping you from slipping. i can walk in transmission fluid or oil with bates and they still grip really well and give bite on smooth surfaces.", "Update, after 2 months of hard work and abuse, the stitching is coming apart. Maybe good for lighter duty. Sad to not be able to repurchase, because the comfort was great. Boots are great, but should have heeded the reviews. I wear a 10.5 in almost every shoe made. Wish I would have ordered a 10. Oh well, after a few days and an insole adjustment they are ok. Next time will order a half size smaller. Everything else about the boots is great, I wear them at work and there is lots of lava, so I will wear them out soon. After a week on the excavator, there definitely keepers.", "They come in handy, I bought them for EMS work but have also worn them like winter boots. They're very easy to put on with a velcro strap and zipper. They're comfy and support your ankle. I had a bone bruise earlier in the year, and my doctor said these were good to help support it. That being said, they have started to fray and look damaged over time. Nothing egregious but I wish they were sturdier for being tactical boots. Depending on what you're buying them for, they aren't bad boots.", "I work as a dog bather, so I'm always around water and concrete floors. These boots, for the most part, keep my feet very dry. They fit well, there is about a week break in period, but overall very nice boots for the price. I will say they dont have an anti-ship quality, but I havent fallen, just ice skated a little. Still would recommend!", "Not only comfortable but zipper makes it easy on & off. I have drop foot issue due to accident and this boot gives me the ankle and muscle support I need to allow me to walk normal than any other boot I\u2019ve worn. I\u2019ve only wore cowboy boots for 40 year, they just don\u2019t give me ankle support. These are excellent boots!", "Got these Inexpensive boots for work. I do not work in a harsh environment. However, the soles came undone at the toe. It was a few months later but I was surprised since they otherwise seemed like well made boots. I've glued them together but not going to wear for work because I don't want them coming undone while I'm working.", "At the time I purchased this product, I could barely walk with sciatic issues and was seeing a podiatrist. Once I got my boots, it felt like I had been given a new lease on life. Along with my support inserts, the pain that plagued me for weeks was 90% gone. I 100% support and believe in this product and it has been a huge part of my recovery. THANK YOU!!!!", "Got a new pair on the way. Posture supportgreat fit, they definitely start to squeak, but my lower back feel much better after regular use. Better than most tactical work boots. Don\u2019t wear in a combat situation, especially on reconnaissance. The squeak is definitely loud enough to pinpoint a target, but it is not really noticeable in a noisy civilian work environment. The arch in the heel that supports lower back posture is the winner in this boot. NOTE: Best when used with doctor prescribed inserts. Remove the inserts that come inside these boots first.", "For the price you cant beat it. I work on concrete all day, these boots provide the cushion and support that is needed. Easy to slip on and off, tie them once and use the side zipper since then. I wanted something affordable, but comfortable. These boots meet all my expectations and needs. After a few months of wear, the bottoms do not show any sign of it. They have good breath-ability, coming home after a long hot day my feet are dry.", "I bought these for motorcycle riding and really like the fit and comfort. As far as water resistant, I got caught in n a rainstorm for a few hours and my feet were soaking wet. I could pour water from the boot. So, not so much on the water part but other than that they are really good.", "Read reviews for this product before purchasing. I am a LEO and spend alot of time on my feet during my 12 hour shifts . I wore these boots for 2 weeks and they never got comfortable . My feet hurt even while driving my patrol car. They look good and seem durable but I wouldnt buy again.", "The boots were destroying my feet so I have to wear 2 pairs of socks and they're now destroying my socks. My toes get wet when its raining or quite wet outside...there not even 1 month old for wet toes....so sad. They aren't worth $50+ I will not be buying them again. If it wasn't for the wet toes and overprice I would give them 2 start but not today. I will say the wide are wide.", "I owned a pair of boots similar to these years ago. I have been looking for these kind of boots for a long time. These boots are comfortable straight out of the box. Light weight so they don't wear you out.(update) I have had these boots for 4 months now and I am still very happy with these. I walk around 5 to 7 miles 5 days a week. Excellent boots and they all but eliminated my foot pain.", "These are comfortable and fit great, lots of room for little toe, which is the main reason I got them. They do not however have adequate slip resistance. I work in a transmission factory and that fluid defeats most soles, so I'm not being too hard on them, but was like ice skating.", "I love the way this boot feels on, very comfortable and very well made. My only complaint is that the sole rubber, especially the heel wears out too quickly. This is my second pair and I want to see if these wear out as quickly as the first pair. The first pair lasted about 8 months walking only 2 miles / 40 minuets per day. They were so comfortable I wanted to see if maybe it was just a bad batch of soft sole material. *Note: they do fit small, I normally wear a size 9 and needed a 9.5 in these boots to fit right", "These boots were way too narrow even though I ordered wide. I couldn't even get the laces all the way up the shoe because it was designed to be so narrow. I think maybe they were not made for USA sizes? Even if they did fit they were very cheap and plasticky feeling. Which isn't so bad at this price point but I can't believe these narrow plastic shoes have such great reviews.", "I am an Asian but my feet is size 14W US. I am consider a Giant amongst most Asian. I was a bit nervous about the size upon ordering this boots but i took the \"leap of faith\" theory & proceed. D-day come & the package arrived, I Saw The Boots, I Wear The Boots & The Rest is History in the Remaking. This Boots fits like my second skin, Comfort, Dry & all that is nice. Changes the Lace to Paracord 550. Added Paracord knot to the zipper.", "I was completely surprised how comfortable these boots were. I was bragging to all my friends what a great deal I found and what fabulous boots they were. Until 2 weeks in ...the lining from the Super comfortable insoles peeled off and some of the stitching came out of the side of the boot. It was an easy fix with some shoe goo. However, I shouldn't have to fix boots that are only a couple weeks old. Still love them, but I'm disappointed and concerned how durable they will be.", "I have worn these boots for work and travel. They have made four trips to Africa and countless trips to the field and back. I purchased them in 2017. They fit and felt great right out of the box. The soles have started to separate from the upper now. I could glue them back together but at the price, I am going to buy a new pair. I have nothing but good things to say about these boots. I know I could buy a name-brand at almost three times the price, but why would I do that. I only hope that the new pair lasts as well.", "Great boots. Got the gold ones in size 10 1/2, but had to get the size 11. Glad I did. Super boot for farm work and looks good for going out too. I have a narrow foot, so the laces make it fit perfectly with great support everywhere. Will buy again in black for winter.", "Excellent light weight boot! I work in construction and was looking for light weight summer boot as the job does not require steel toe. So I browsed and found these, they feel like your wearing sneakers from the start. I also like how easy they go on and off with the zipper on the side. Those with bad backs know what it is like struggling to put your boots on in the morning! I highly recommend these for light duty!!", "As a black leather boot Army Veteran I love anything military. Having only one hand makes it nearly impossible to put the old LPC's on. (Leather Personnel Carriers) These are such a breeze with the side zipper. They fit exactly as described and are extremely comfortable.", "I must admit, these are by far the best boots I\u2019ve owned. I originally ordered them for work, but now I find myself wearing them outside of work too. I will be ordering another pair. They are extremely comfortable and lightweight. Other boots I\u2019ve ordered on Amazon were too heavy, and I immediately returned. The zipper makes it convenient. I usually only buy men\u2019s shoes. I prefer the style, colors, and how they look and fit my feet. I ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfectly. That\u2019s also the same size I wear in a tennis shoe. They do fit as expected, but if you\u2019d like a tad bit more toe room, get a half size up.", "Ordered these boots to use daily for my job as a roofer. I love the side zipper which makes putting on and taking off super easy, and they\u2019re lightweight and pretty comfortable for all day work. However, they were never waterproof for me, anything more than a small puddle and my feet were wet. Also the laces broke in the first week and I needed to change them out. After 4 months of 50hr a week roofing the soles were separating from the uppers. Very comfortable boot for less demanding work, but not a good option for hard work like roofing.", "I wear a 15EEEE so have a VERY limited selection of shoes and boots. None of the other makes carry my size so I was very pleased to find these. I have had them a week and have worn them for 5 days. So far so good. A bit snug in the width but that is to be expected with mu extra wide hoofs. My only concern is the small Velcro pad as I don't feel it will last that long but we will see.", "She isn't the combat boot type and was surprised how comfortable they were. No long term testing on these suede desert types (She probably will never wear them out) but I've worn their black waterproof version for 6 months and again, for the money they are good footwear", "So I'm not normally a review guy, but these boots have been extraordinarily comfortable. I've had them a month and they're really breaking in. So far , I like the zippers there large and work excellent .the velcro (once they get the dog hair out of them) work great. Theyve been worn everyday, at work, out for walks with the spousal equivalent.. And gotten beat up by the pegs on my motorcycle, which I why I bought them in the first place. Their dry, warm even at a \"wind speed\" of 80 mph. Ive already ordered another pair strictly for the bike, and will do so again in the future.", "Fit is dead on. Pretty comfortable out of the box, seem like they'll break in nicely. I got them for riding my motorcycle and the flexibility is there. Only giving three stars because I've only had them for two days, this could change in either direction. Update: it\u2019s been 7 months and these boots are still rocking as far as comfort and durability. They are not in any way warm while riding motorcycle in cold weather, your feet will freeze. They are in no way waterproof, they will fill with water while riding in heavy rain.", "the toes are snug like others say. on the right boot where the \"leather\" meets the fabric, the seam digs into my heal the left boot my big toe knuckle rubs the top of the boot. im gonna buy another pair of boots before these dig holes in my feet.", "I'm a Correctional Officer and these boots are great for what I do. They have a medium shine and are easy to keep looking good. It took a couple of weeks to break them in but I love them! Very comfortable. Will buy another pair when these get too scuffed up to wear to work. Very reasonably priced compared to other similar brands.", "These boots \ud83d\udc62 are really sweet. I've been wearing a pair of 5.11s for the last 2 years. These boots are every bit as good. Only time will tell how long they last..So far its all good 2go .I've worn them every day and they are comfortable and seem well made. My old boots got a hole and going to these was like easy transition.", "I've owned numerous sidezipper boots and the zipper on these does seem to be on par if not better than most boots. I wear 10.5 wide so base of previous reviews I ordered an 11w. The boots were plenty wide but we too long. I do image with how the 11s felt, a 10.5 might be just a little too small. These boots are definitely not hot weather boots, the tongue and collar are heavily padded. One the soles of mine had a hole in the side of the sole that appeared to be from a bubble that formed when the rubber material was molded. Returned the boots due to size and sole defect.", "I had to send this back 2 times because of defects. One pair had the eyelets not aligned and that replace had a scuff that was very visible on the toe. I went 1/2 inch bigger since I put insoles in them and they are very comfortable once you break them in.", "I just received my boots today. I put on a light weight pair of socks and tried just the right boot on. It has an high arch support, its narrow, and it was short! Across the board they run small for the size. I ordered a 13 2E. I'm sending it back but I'm not giving up just yet. I really like how the boot is made so I am reordering in a 14 2E lets see if that will work. Almost tempted to order a 15 2E as well and send back the one that doesn't fit.", "I have only had then a short time, the boot was a little stift at first, but after using them now easy to put on and take off. I was look for support in walking due to back problems, so far things are better than regular shoes. The boot is very comfee and light. I feel this boot maybe a win-win. I did get the boot one size larger only because of a lack of feeling in my feet.", "The quality of the material and construction is not that good. I normally wear an American size 9.5D. After reading the reviews, I decided to buy 10.5D. However, they still don't fit properly and my smaller toes still hit on the sides. Plus, my right heel does not seem to fit correctly into the right heel of the that boot. Next time I'll order the Converse TAC boots I used to wear.", "Ordered two pairs, size 8 for my boyfriend and 7.5 for me. The first 7.5 zipper broken on first use, they took a little longer than I would've liked to get back to me and inform me they were out of stock on my size (after I sent them back) but *Upgraded* them to the insulated version, just had the ultimate test of 12*degree in snow and not amazing insulation, but wool socks would be a great combo. I added Dr Schols insoles for more comfort. Overall I am happy with them! One year warranty too so hopefully They'll last!", "These boots are exactly what I wanted for on duty, all day, comfort. They are somewhat stiff when first wearing them, however, any quality footwear will be stiff at first. Your footwear should be comfortable while stiff at first, as they will conform each person's foot through regular use. The true test for a quality shoe/boot is having them comfortable to wear while breaking them in, and ultimately, fit your feet exactly once molded to your particular fit. Order your normal foot size and you will find these boots will be an excellent purchase.", "These boots are not waterproof at all. Reading the description; states waterproof but they are not at all. Bought these for my son to ride his quad which we do get wet riding through streams and puddles. These boots were totally soaked on the inside! He also said they were not very warm and this was at 46 degrees. Reading the sellers info they state a waterproof option. Well?! How / where / when. Either they are or they aren\u2019t! No choice in ordering...", "So these are my first \"combat boots\", but I've worn steeltoe to hiking to winter boots, and let me tell you something: I would wear these all day and every day. They're light when compared to other boot types, They've got about as much drag as a nice pair of sneakers/tennis/sports shoes, They've got the spring of runners shoes, The protective feel of boots They feel light, tough, and spry The hard sole gives you a bolstered feeling. They feel like the ultimate footware. hoo rah/10 Damn, these are good boots.", "It lasted a year of occasional wear- once a month light wear. I was disappointed that it fell apart as soon I started to wear it often.....the sole started to come off. I had to get it resown to continue wearing it. It's fairly comfortable though", "These boots fit on my foot perfectly, right out of the box. I was skeptical about them at first since they were so cheap but a week in and they still look new. I work EMS and they are holding up well so far. Cant wait to test them more! I recently bought Polish to shine them back up!", "Extremely uncomfortable, killing my heal, i cannot get them to break in. which is unusual. this is my third pair. other pairs have been fine, with a normal break in period. not sure why this pair is seemingly tight and unable to break in. its going on 5 weeks now. im about ready to give up. this is not a reflection on the seller. this has nothing to do with the seller. no problems with the seller at all. they did not make the boots.", "I use 13 or 12 wide shoes and boots. I went with the 12 wide. It probably is wide where that dimension is measured. However, they use a plastic toe guard and I'll bet dollars to doughnuts that the toe shield is the same size across a whole spectrum of sizes. It squeezes the toes and my left boot becomes too painful to wear more than an hour or to walk more that a couple hundred yards. I'll return it or if that's too much hassle I'll slice the toe to relieve the tightness and just avoid water.", "I've owned many different brands of tactical zip up boots. My boots arrived yesterday and I have had them on all day. So far so good, my feet feel great. These boots appear to be well made and should last me a while. The quality is comparable to Bates, but the cost of Maelstrom is much less. -- GREAT VALUE and QUALITY.", "After recently losing a significant amount of weight I realized that my duty boots were floating on my feet and causing myriad issues as the result. These new boots fit well right out of the box and I was surprised that I did not have to change out of them after a couple hours to be able to get used to them. I completed a 6 hour detail on my feet and in motion nearly the whole time and my feet feel fine. The high ratings others have given are well deserved. I am very happy with this purchase.", "Fit great, look good, no break-in, very light but still have excellent support and protection for my feet, I'm 6'4\" and 250 lbs. and on my feet 8 - 10 hours, walking 5 + ,miles, mostly on concrete and in wet conditions, each shift. In more than 2 years at this job, I've tried rubber boots, but the soles wear through in less than 2 months, and leather boots get water-logged, never able to get dried out, and none have gone more than 5 months, even some fairly expensive ($125) models. If these last 3 - 4 months, they will be the best solution I've found.", "I usually buy Bates Ultralites but decided to try something new. Bates are the only boots that I have been able to wear comfortably and the break in period is minimal with Bates. But, these boots are proving to be a very good alternative to Bates and will probably even surpass Bates and become the Primary \"Go To Boot\". Cant beat the price for the quality of these boots. Look Out Bates these boots are hot on your trail. SO FAR SO GOOD but Time will tell .", "Hubby loves them. Wears them everyday for work. Only thing he said was he may need an insert for the front half of boot. Heal is good. And that they were irritating the top of his toe area. He just bought thicker socks to wear with them.", "Base skimped to in the leather for the boot. Rather than the laces closing the boot, The laces strap across a big open area on the bridge of your foot. It's not very comfortable. If you pull them tight, You make the leather grate against your ankles. They are just not designed very well", "Thought for the money I'd give these a try. Second week in the leather material started cracking and deteriorating around the shoelace eyelets. Probably two months in the sole started to dislocate itself from the boot slightly. I've had these 5-6 months now and it's time to replace. I got a year out of the under armor boots I bought previously. I think I'll go back to those for around $90.", "First day wearing the boots, I wear a 12 and ordered a 12 and they are a perfect fit, I could have probably fit in a 11.5 because the boots are soft and will probably expand once broken in. They aren't made for warmth but they are roomy enough for thick socks. I like them a lot, super light weight.", "I bought these for my Grandson, who is handicapped with Cerebral Palsy, the zipper makes it possible for him to put the boots on with no help. No one who hasn't known someone with this affliction would understand how great this is. He also thinks they look great as well. Linda Stover", "I purchased these to use as motorcycle boots. They are much more comfortable than expected, provide some serious traction, and are very easy to put on and remove with the side zipper. Also they kept my feet warm in 37 degree weather this morning. I don't think motorcycling is considered a use case for these boots, but hey, they work great anyhow! The only (minor) issue I have with these boots is that the right one has developed an annoying squeak in between the cushion and rubber out-soles that I was unable to fix, but it's only noticeable when I clomp around my quiet office.", "Having wide feet makes it a real pain finding footwear. My old boots where literally falling apart, no place to buy decent footwear for 60 miles since wallyworld moved in. So, to my great and unexpected joy they fit, such a rare thing. I didn't have to go a 1/2 or full size larger. Long enough, wide enough, and even high enough in the arch. Just enough is my only complaint: the tongue and sole pad are just enough. The tongue could have been another 2 or 3 cm higher and wider and the sole pad could have been a little 'padderier' with some stiffness support along the edges. Otherwise, I like them.", "OK boot for the price! BUT... The footbeds are garbage \ud83d\ude21. I have worn these boots about 10 times. Only once did I wear them all day and walk around. I just replaced the footbeds with new $12 work type from Wally's World, see the pictures and decide for yourself. I'll go with something different next time, but time will tell how the outside holds up? Safe travels.", "I bought these to replace an identical pair that was a few years old. The old ones fit and held up so well that I knew I HAD to get the same model again! I have wider feet and the WIDE option on these is GREAT! Very happy, especially for the price!", "For the price tag, you actually get more than what you pay for. Years ago i bought the landship boots and they fell apart few months in when i was a patrol deputy. These are solid and i mean solid out the box. Give it few days to break in and they work fine. Comfortable too but a bit on the hard side when walking a lot.", "Over a year with these boots working 40+ hour weeks, all types of terrain and running after people. They\u2019ve held up nicely for the price point. The pictures depict the heel wear and the other is where the right boot finally gave up on life. I\u2019ll be buying another pair no doubt. The right boot separating happened today.", "Liked this boot due to they were very comfortable. I work as an HVAC tech and these boots only lasted 5 months and the sole started coming apart but besides that these boots are great for someone who is not going to be too hard on them, maybe they will last longer.", "Nice fit, light weight boot, worn in rain and cold weather only had for few weeks . But so far so good very comfortable being wearing 12 hours or more daily .. 6out of 7 days a week. Bought this because of reviews of others will update after worn boots for a longer period of time.", "Stitching on the toe boots started coming out three times after I wore them... I tried to contact the seller to find out if they could do anything and three months later have not heard anything back. These are junk at a low price", "I usually wear these on messy days to walk through muddy conditions and other annoying weather conditions. I wouldn't say they are waterproof but they are somewhat water resistant. The most interesting thing about these boots is the small height boost they give you it's only about 2-3 inches but it is noticeable. The only downside I have experienced so far is the shoelaces are a pain to deal with, however the boots can zip up so the laces aren't a huge problem", "I have purchased two pairs of these boots now, and they seem to last me right around 6 months per pair. First pair ripped out on the side, my second pair the two eyelets ripped out apart from the leather. Fit is good, they take a few times of wearing to break in but after that feel fine. I just wish they lasted at least a few months longer.", "Hubby lovesthem for work. Recommends, for someone on their feel at. Almost time like to gut him new Pair, When I asked he says he wants another pair of Maelstrom Tac Force & nothing else! 20 yrs inthe Army hegets Particular about his boots:", "About 2 weeks ago, on Amazon, I bought Timberland boots. Those boots are much more comfortable than these Maelstrom. The Maelstrom are very lightweight/cheap feel. The thin laces make it very difficult to achieve equal pressure on foot, ankle, and shin - compared to the thick laces on Timerland. Also, there appears to be no arch support - after wearing these a couple of hours, my feet hurt. There is no way you can use these hiking, hunting, or for any tactical duty. They look kind of nice, but my next pair of tactical boots will be Timerland.", "8 inch boots are just what I wanted. I ordered half size larger as per other reviews. The fit is good. Side zipper are good they go way down and my big foot slides right in. My old boots the zipper was shorter and you had to pull it on. I like the toe and heal being sewed not just glued. Well worth buying", "Ordered 3 weeks ago and wore only 10 days. By the 5 day mark, the materials began to crack and break down in 2 spots on each boot. Very cheap materials and should not be this deteriorated with only 10 days of use.", "If these boots hold up they should be great. The fit is spot on, they\u2019re extremely comfortable, unbelievably light weight and look great, the only complaint so far is about the shipper, they were late arriving but the worst part about that is they LIED and said the delay was due to severe weather or natural disaster. If 68 degrees with sunshine is severe weather I can only imagine what they\u2019ll say this winter!!", "The price is good, and the boot fits pretty good. I really like the velco and zipper on the side, makes it easy to take off and put on. Very comfortable. If you need extra arch support I would recommend getting custom insoles. But the insoles are not bad just middle of the road.", "I could not believe how comfortable these boots were.They are as comfortable as sneakers but really support the ankles when standing all day. They did not require a break in period like some boots. I really like the side zipper which make them very easy to put on.I would rate these a 10.I will buy the same boot when i need another pair.", "Bought these 18 months ago to wear for yard work the odd evening after work and weekends.They were comfy and fit as expected but last week the stitching around the toe gave out (see photo). I really expected them to last longer when only used for an hour or two here and there - granted I have dug a few holes in the yard to plant trees etc... Not the most expensive boot but not the cheapest either...", "I like my Maelstrom boots but sadly this time I received a pair that had a stain on the toe . I returned them and ordered another pair. They fit as expected and like all new shoes take a bit to break in and then alls good. I like the fact with the side zipper that you can tie them and then get in and out with the zipper quickly. Theyre comfortable fit well and wear well. Highly recommended.", "Needed boots for work since my job demands it and couldn\u2019t be more happier. There are periods where I find myself standing for more than 5 hours and these boots make it comfortable for me. The only issue I encountered so far was the zipper sometimes zipping into my skin and let me tell you it HURTS! I\u2019ve since corrected that, by loosening the boot up but other than that these are wonderful and I\u2019m definitely going to purchase another pair!", "I had no idea how comfortable these boots would be prior to purchasing them. I bought them for taking them out to the range but they're so comfortable I wear them pretty regularly. Easy to put on with the zipper on the side and feels good on your feet. Highly recommend them!", "The boots themselves are very nice, but when my laces broke from the rust on the loops cutting through them, I was very disappointed. I was at work at the time and all I had to hold them together was some zip ties, which was embarrassing. An easy solution would be to put stainless steel loops on the boots so they don't rust in less than a month of wearing them. I used some 550 paracord to lace them back up and they're working fine for now, but I know it will happen again.", "Love these boots. These are some of the most comfortable boots I have ever owned. Use them for work and bought a pair for off duty as well. I have purchesed 3 pair so far and have been pleased with them every time I get a pair. I work as a paramedic and usually go through a pair a year no matter how much I spend on boots. These hold out as well as boots 3 times the price and are more comfortable. If you order tan, the size seems to be right. If you order black I would order at least 1/2 size larger.", "These boots are well constructed... I would suggest ordering a half size up... They run a little small.", "Fantastic Boots, look alright, durable, well made, they easily have the quallity of $150 boots, but for such a fantastic low price, it makes these the best boots I've ever bought, $150-$300 pair of name brand would be slightly better quality, but nothing that would make the price worth it, for under $50 much much higher quality work boot than expected very good buy as a secondary pair of boots, compared to $150-$300 name brand these boots are vastly superior because they're under $50 and that makes them kinda amazing but I went into this with low expectations", "For the price I wasn't expecting a above average boot, However I didn't expect one that would unravel the first day. Don;t waste your money and don't wait up for a reply on how to return them.But they look good in the shoe box.", "Got these based on price and reviews here, nice fitting boot, comfortable after 6hrs of wearing. But the toe lacing started to come loose after about 4 hrs of wear on the left boot! Next day, I pulled the remaining lacing out and noticed the right boot toe lacing was starting to come out too!!! I pulled that one out too... We will see if this lacing is functional or just decorative and how long the boot will last in general. If the toe lacing came loose after 7hrs from new, I'm not holding out too much hope on the remaining lacing that is functional...", "One word HORRIBLE. Omg, The most uncomfortable boots I've ever owned and I bought the right size. The top front of the boot applies too much pressure making the top of your feet ache only after minutes. The boots are made of cheap material. The front scuffed all up one hour into working. Stay away these boots are not good. You have been warned.", "I purchased these after need replacements for my under armor boots, I seen many favorable reviews. Now, I wore these to work. I do walk 8 hours a day on concrete floors, first hour ok, 2nd hour feeling discomfort from insole, 3rd hour, cant go any more, had to replace insoles for me. finished out the shift, now home feet are sore, both little toes are sore. too narrow and is a 13 wide, quality of the boots seem ok, just gonna need little break in time, if it gets better or worse, will try and update this in future.", "These are nice looking boots and they fit well. However, I did end up taking the insole out of my old duty boots (rocky) and switched them with the ones in the Maelstrom boots. I only bought these for riding so the only walking I have done so far has been at festivals which will mean a longer break in period. So far so good and I will try to remember to update later on after I have put them to a real test.", "For some lower priced boots, these are not bad. The zipper does seem a bit weak, but I try to slow zip them and have not had an issue. The description mentions these are waterproof, but yesterday I went hiking and stepped into a puddle and felt some water leak in. Also, you have to wear long socks and pants if you don\u2019t want the upper part of the boot to scratch against your lower leg. I don\u2019t use them hard, but so far they have worked okay.", "Amazed at how good this boot is for the price, I know the zippers will fail at some point but they are really convenient until they do. You would not want to hike for miles in these but for knock-around work boots they are great. Put in some drugstore arch supports and good to go. Fit is about right on, maybe a tad short for size, if in doubt about width go ahead and order the wide. Maybe a bit slippery soles until they get beatup some, but then they are alright. My star rating is relative to price.", "The boots arrived on time and in good condition , they do feel a little heavier (weight & temperature) then expected. The soles are decent they don't slip or sqeek like other is have had. The have a soft comfortable feel when walking in soft or loose soils but they are pretty hard if you walk on pavement I can defiantly feel the difference. Over all these where a a affordable boot so decent for the money", "Update: these shoes ripped apart with less than a month of occasional wear. DO NOT BUY I was hoping these things would last but after one month, the sole is already coming off both boots in the same locations. They also run about a half size larger than advertised.", "The material on the top and toe of the boot tears really easy. The shoe laces broke after a month of wearing. I did buy another pair of the Smith and Wesson over these cheap boots the Smith and Wesson lasted a year before I got a small hole wear I would remove the boot with my other boot. Not worth wasting your money. Unless u don't walk or work all day\ud83d\ude01", "The boots are pretty inexpensive, so not expecting perfection, I have worn them for a good 6 months and they 've held up well.... however, they were a bit too short, maybe a half size too short to where I had to use a stretcher on them.... but then the ankles and support around the foot was rather sloppy.... SO, after putting larger insoles in them, and using the stretcher, I got them to fit ok.... though the looseness around ankles is kind of an ankle-buster around the uneven surface of the farm.", "They fit fine and are as I expected. I only gave a 4 star because one of the laces had a frayed on it and will obviously be weakened and brake soon. Would like to get a new lace but don't want to go through the bother of sending them back etc.", "The fit of these boots is pretty small. I wear between a 9 and a 10, the length is OK as I ordered a 10 but I should have ordered a 10w apparently and I have never had to order wide sizes. It fits well but is a little tight. Hoping after they get broken in a little it won't be so noticable. I bought them for paintballing in the woods Sona tighter fit is not a bad thing. Seem very well made and I will update after a few outings.", "Out of the box, these are not comfortable. I got some different insoles and that helped. They seem wider than usual so they are a little sloppy. Hopefully they will get more comfortable with age. Seem to be made well.", "They are good boots for a time the toe box is comfortable, the width was perfect, and the fit is about as good as I expected. The only gripe I have is with the durability of the boot. It only lasted about a month before the outer sole started to come off. The shoe became looser after about 2 months (even with lace tightening). Its durability dropped to about 30% of what it was when I first got it at the third month. The grip remained great throughout the time though.", "Runs narrow ordered 10 wide normally wear 10 medium or regular width fit perfect in wide width. Love side zipper, easy to take off shoes when entering house after outdoor chores. Very satisfied", "I work for FedEx Ground, and I bought these shoes in February to use for work. When I first got them they seemed perfect. Fit comfortably, seemed rugged enough. But notice I say \"seemed\" rugged enough. It's currently July 6th, and when I get home tonight they'll be getting tossed in the bin. Why you may ask? Because the soles are falling off of them. Just shy of 5 months, and they are ragged. It's just from normal wear and tear. I've had walmart boots last a year or more, including through our peak season. These lasted barely 5 months through our slow season. TL:DR look great, fit great, have the lifespan of a mayfly", "Great boots for their purpose. For $70, they are just expensive enough for me to feel comfortable wearing them, but also not feel too bad about getting them muddied or scuffed up. After 2 years of use, I've scuffed and scratched the hell outta mine. They still work great, but they look terrible now so I'll be replacing them soon.", "The interior over lapping seams are initially irksome and the boots were uncomfortable is a few places around the toe area. I took a lighter and burned as much of the material away. I then saturated the boots with warm water and went for a long hike. I hope the boots will wear more comfortable now. For the price and function of the boot, I would recommend. Edit, a rip near the toe area developed within 6 weeks. Truly disappointed. One star, don't buy. I spent over $100 bucks for a pair of 511, amazing as compared.", "Looks like quality boot but unfortunately, sizing is a major issue on this item. I ordered wide size 8, but these feel more like size 7 narrow. This sizing is typically what you find in those shoe warehouse places where there is never a pair and the show has a funny shape to it. Very dissappointed. But then again, im compairing these boots to my Ft Lewis boots that have many many Infantry miles on them.", "These Boots are cool. I use these for work and the only problem I have is the bottom comes apart a lil. But I had them for 6 months and for the price I just replace them every 6 months. Ohh yeah. If your in the army you will stick out like a sore thumb and get called out on the fatness where the ankle is because of the padding. And the zipper. Other than that the style is cool. Looks cool. Comfortable and I tie these once and just use the zipper to take them off. Badass civilian boots.", "Came with glue smeared from the bottoms up onto the leather. Right boot had loose stitching around the toe with threads hanging off about 2\" long that had to be melted back to the rubber to secure them. The price was great or I would have gone 3 stars", "Use these zippered boots for yard/gardening work and they are great. I particularly like easy on, easy off zipper feature. With polishing and care hopefully they will last a good long time.", "I gave a pair of these boots to my son who is a police officer. He didn't wear them for several months, continuing to wear his old boots. He wore them last week and called me that afternoon to tell me how much he loved them. He said he loved that he could take them off and on quickly with the zippers on the sides. He said they were more like wearing sneakers than boots. I told them I would buy him another pair to keep on hand whenever he needs them. He has back problems and he said he thought wearing these boots helped. You have a loyal customer.", "I've had these boots for a few months and I'm very happy with them. They weren't packed well, when I got them the box was ripped open and one of the boots was sticking out, but the boots themselves are great. I wear them daily and they are holding up well, and are very comfortable. I will buy another pair when these wear out. One other thing, I'm very hard to please when it comes to footwear, so for me to give these five stars is pretty remarkable.", "I am actually pleasantly surprised by how well built these are and how comfortable they seem. A good boot is comfortable from the start with no break in period. These fit the bill. Been wearing them for a month now and no problems at all.", "Bought these for work, after a few weeks the front toe stitching started coming out, the glue is still holding though. Leather scuffs/pitts very easy. It's good for a cheat alternative to active work boots, but the quality difference is apparent after you wear them for a while. Zippers work fine, no issue so far, that is a boot killer in this style. Was hoping for a better quality than what you'd find at a fart-mart, it's what I got.", "Used only for playing paintball once every 6 weeks or so. The upper was in pretty bad shape by the end of October. The upper separated from the lower yesterday. It was hard to get their attention regarding the warranty - I emailed them through their web site and left this review. Finally, I called them and left a voice message. Leaving the voice message seemed to do the trick - by the end of the day I had a warranty replacement on it way to me. The replacement arrived today - I'll see if I just got unlucky with the first pair and let y'all know.", "While this boot does the job, you will definitely want to waterproof these boots with Mink Oil or a spray water proofing agent. These are not cold weather boots, nor are they sold as such, but with a good pair of wool socks, these boots provide enough warmth to make it through shoveling the driveway. I would buy these boots again.", "The boot was the correct size, but it was cutting into the top of my foot near the toe knuckle and became very painful after only wearing them for 1/2 hour. Maybe ordering a larger size or two pairs of socks might be helpful.", "I live in upstate Ny north of Syracuse where we get a lot of snow and cold temps, So far these boots have done the job. I looked at a number of other brands but I decided to take a chance on these and I'm glad I did.", "Only giving a 3 star review due to the fact if you live in colder areas (like the UP of Michigan.) These boots are horrible in winter. They are not warm for the climates here, and definitely won't keep your feet dry. As far as for working in a place where boots are needed or summer- they are great then.", "These boots are super lightweight. I have heavier tennis shoes. They seam very durable znd verry well made. I have owned 300.00 boots in the past not this well made. Bravo", "At first they are tight. Real tight. These boots need to be worn to break in. After a few hrs of walking and making fists with my toes, they fit nice and firm. I wear these to death valley when I go to Vegas to hike. Like these better than 5.11 because the boots have a loop on the heel to pull them on.and 30-40 cheaper.", "those vibram molded bottoms of those more expensive boot,s kill my feet . So far very comfy , light ,and i have bad back ...... easy on an off .", "They are seriously comfortable. I was in need of boots and wear 15 5e usually but finding them at a good price was nearly impossible. So i took a gamble on these and I'm glad I did. They may fit a little snug but the insides are so soft and cushioned i can barely tell. Zippers seem durable enough but time will tell. They are on the warmer side even though the are listed as uninsulated. Would definitely purchase again", "Fit was as expected, but the quality isn't great. Two months in and the eyelets have cut completely through the laces on both left and right, and worn them down in several other places. The Velcro on one of the ankle straps is poorly stitched and is ripped mostly off (it's not structural, the flap it secures just covers the zip when closed, but still). They were cheap, so not a disaster, but I don't think I'd buy them again.", "I've work these boys about 10 or 15 times since I purchased them about 6 months ago. Last week I had to replace the insoles, as they were ripped up, with the liner coming off. Today I see a tear in the tongue. I'll not buy from them again. Not made well.", "I got this boot for riding my motorcycle . I have a size 10 foot wide and got the 10.5 with my polo socks fits comfortably. Took maybe 3 weeks of very light walking into and out of work to break in . The air mesh is nice while riding when you tip your toes parallel with the ground, cooling the bottoms of your feet. Over 300 miles on the Harley and no shifter wear yet. Awesome boot for the price .", "I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just the one I received or if this is common with this boot. My laces that came with the boots within the first week got cut by the loop holes. The front of the boot shows creases right away, and after about 2 weeks of use they now make loud creaking noises when I walk. The price was cheaper than most of the competition but you get what you pay for.", "I am so disappointed in these boots. As you can see from this photo the material around the eye lace holes has torn. You can also tell that these booths have been hardly worn. I do not recommend you waste your money on this pair of boots. I hope the manufacturer see\u2019s this pic and addresses the issue with a better quality lacing design.", "Great boots. Liked my first pair so much I wore a hole from my shifter on my scoot. Tried to find another pair but couldn't find my size. I finally ordered a narrower width to try and they fit so I ordered another to have a spare. Great boot and the price is unbeatable.", "My husband had ordered these once a year for the last three years. This year's pair were a little too tight and the zipper is difficult to pull up on one of them. I have a feeling the zippers won't last that long this time. A bit disappointed that we're going to have to move on to a different kind of boot from now on. They are comfy boots, look great, and were a great price.", "I purchased these boots Feb of 2018. By November the string on the toe/sole that holds the boot to the sole came off and split the boot. I bought Gorilla Glue and dumped the whole bottle in between to keep them viable for a bit longer. Again, I will say I like the zipper over some other brands as the one on these boots are bigger than average and seem strong, but will look for another brand that last at least 1 year. Average use: 7 months of total use on 12hr shifts, moderate to heavy patrolling.", "Bought these last minute due to an emergency and needed something quick for work. These boots went straight from the delivery box to the trash can.. I know you \"get what you pay for\" but C'mon!! I might as well have bought boots from Party City or the Disney Store for this type of quality. Cheap material, poor fitting and painful on feet and ankles. If you are a grown man or woman doing actual adult work you should not buy these and go with a respectable brand like Bates or Under Armour etc.. smh", "Rubs against my toes a lot. Threading around the toe began coming out within days of starting to wear them. So aside from getting sores on my toes from them, they work ok.", "I had very low expectations of these boots because of the price. These boots are very good quality and I wear them often. I am a roofing company so I am constantly on and off of asphalt shingles and these boots have held up just as good as any of the expense of boots that I own. I will purchase more of these as needed.", "I purchased these boots because they seemed to be the most budget friendly boots that still had good reviews. I could not be happier with them. They fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable. Very light weight and appears to be very well made. Will try to update as time goes by.", "I'm very disappointed in my son's review of these boots. My son wore them for 1 week and the left boots grommets are tearing away from the fabric of the boot. And these are supposed to military tactical?? The military would cancel their contract over this boot. I'd like a replacement p air sent, only because my son lo v rd the boot. Thank you.", "I bought these in men's 11 which is the same size as my current Original SWAT boots. They were tight, to the point of minor discomfort, I almost exchanged them. I stayed the course and alternated boots for 2 weeks. They broke in well and now fit perfect. For the price/quality you cannot go wrong if you are in need of good boots. Will buy again.", "Fits as expected, but horrible quality! After like 45 days they are trash. You get what you pay. Won\u2019t be skimping on price again trying to save a buck. Don\u2019t buy!!", "I typically wear women's 9.5 or 9, so I ordered a men's 7 for my duty boots. They're simple, streamlined and in good condition. They're easier to clean than my old Bates. I had my Bates for 5 years of hard duty, so we will have to see if these meet that mark. But for the price, they deliver", "These boots are great for the price. I work in EMS and to have zippable boots are great. They\u2019re comfortable and have held up great in some rough situations!", "Great boots ! They are very light weight. I like the zipper sides because they are easy to get in and out of. If you want them to stay new looking, do as I did and buy a can of Scotch Guard and put two coats on them. This makes dirt and water repel off of them ,and makes cleaning much easier. They are super comfortable. If you love your feet , BUY THESE !!", "After wearing combat boots for many years in the military, I have to say that I love these boots. They fit just a tiny bit small. Not small enough for me to exchange them, or even bother me for 12 hour work days, but they are a hair small. I normally wear a 10.5r boot (which is what I ordered) with a little bit of extra room, however these boots have my toe almost to the front. You can adjust the fit a little by how tight/loose the laces are. All in all, I would order another pair of these boots in a second, and plan to do so once these wear out. They are holding up great.", "I have not owned them long but I love the way they feel! I have a truly wide foot (EE) and 11.5 length, they fit ex-act-ly the how those measurements describe. There is a lot to be said for that, because some manufacturers are too narrow, even when they claim to be EE or wider! They look cool and the zipper makes putting them on quicker. The insole is comfortable, but only time will tell how good it is and of course water resistance and warmth have not been put to the test yet either. So far...GREAT! Especially at that price.", "I love love love love these boots. I use em for motorcycle riding, they keep my feet warm, they don't twist when twisting by heel and toe, they are easy in easy out from their YKK zipper system. I haven't maintained them (they are leather of course), for a while but they still look a week old! They did get dirt on them after riding through dirt, but I just wiped it off with a cloth and all is fine.", "I am very please with how well these boots fit. Felt comfortable when I put them on. Does not appear to need break in time. Work in the mid west, winter has been pretty cold. Just wearing regular socks, feet stay nice and toasty. Very happy with these boots. Now let us see how long they will last. I only wear them every third day for my shift, should go for awhile !!", "These are extremely comfortable--especially in hot weather--and more durable than expected. For my job as a park ranger, I wore these every single day for about six months. I was not easy on them, but the only damage is one broken thread, which appears to be decorative. The sole is still in great shape, and they still offer plenty of arch support. Best $50 shoes I've ever owned.", "I love how these fit me. I bought the mens boot in my size. I have worn boots for 20 years at work and bought very expensive boots. These are very economical and I can say these are one of the best fitting. They are light and comfortable! UPDATE: I still love how these fit, however, after wearing them for over a week I realized they scuff really easily. After wearing Danners for 10 years I'm hoping they last longer then a year.", "Nice looking work boot and very lite weight with comfortable feel. However, due to the shoes poorly engineered design, the shoe slides up & down on the heel as you walk in it. Thinking this was a process in getting the shoes acclimated to my feet I tried them for 3 days, and at the end of the day could not get them off my feet soon enough. After three days these shoes are history! Never want to see another Malestrom shoe.", "These work well for work boots. However, I started using them to hike in the mountains, and 2 seams are starting to come undone on the zipper. They haven't yet, and maybe won't, but they are starting. I've wore these 5 or 6 days week since I bought them roughly 6 months ago, so some wear and tear is expected I guess.", "Great boot. I've used it once and it felt great. They boots gives great protection to the ankle from been twisted. Every step down on the ground, holds the ground really good and gives me stability. I recommend it !", "I've had boots like this before, and loved them, that why I bought these.. Really nice not having to have to tie them every time ya put them on... Especially if your belly is in the way..", "This is my second, and last pair of this brand.. The first pair didn't make 6 months and the soles were blown out...i do use work boots rather hard so i thought maybe it was just a bad pair.. For the price, i decided to try one more pair, and they only lasted 3 months with same result...I guess you get what you pay for.. I'm going back to the more expensive brands and there i get 2-3 years of use on average...Unless you are just an occassional boot user i'd skip these and spring for better quality...", "I'm still breaking these boots in but so far so good. I really like the side zipper (first pair) and now that I have the laces all dressed and tied it is too easy to get these boots on and off. They are lighter that I thought they would be - that's is really nice as when I do wear these boots it will be all day for long days. I have not tried to polish them yet but it looks like they will take wax and give off a good shine.", "For the price I paid, these are lot more comfortable and sturdier than I expected, and I figure they'll end up lasting about two or three years (nothing surprising there, get what you pay for). I did get new socks for when I'm wearing these though (Dickies), as my usual were just a hair too thin. They clean up pretty easy too.", "Writing this review in January, 2018 These boots, while they lasted, fit as expected and were easy to wear. They were comfortable and easy to use, but within four months of owning the boots, the sole separated and the inner fabric tore into shreds. I was absolutely appalled that the boots didn't even last 6 months, as so many reviews gave me a positive view. I was heavily disappointed and felt as if I had been robbed. I hope that others have better luck with these boots. I was not so fortunate as some of the other reviewers.", "Have had these boots for just over a month now. Have 0 complaints. Love the zipper as it makes taking on/off the boots no problem at all. Using them while in police academy and are a great inexpensive option for those on a budget.", "These boots were terrible. I wore for 6 weeks hoping they would break in. My feet started to bother me after work. Switched to a pair of Ecco and my feet are fine now. Both were 11 standard width. Just poorly made. Probably from China.", "Very comfortable boot. The base is not as \"gym shoe \" feel as the Rhino's but different manufactures feel slightly different. Not something I would return for. They are very comfortable don't get me wrong, I just came out of Rhino after 10 years so they feel different to me, that's all. They feel like they will last as long as my old boots which is great. Very easy on and off, and very comfortable uppers. I use them as my everyday motorcycle boots as they are very good on a daily use schedule. Look forward to giving them a hard life with comfort.", "These are just what my husband wanted for motorcycle riding! Durable soles, Very sturdy, and hot!! They do run large so be sure to go down a size. He normally wears an 8,5 or 9, I ordered the 8 and they are a little large, but with the right socks, will be fine. Great boots for the money.", "So far I\u2019m satisfied with this purchase, I didn\u2019t expect more of the product cause I know what\u2019s for and for that price is just great, no complains and if it breaks, I\u2019ll get another pair cause the boots are really great", "Great boots especially for the price. Lightweight and love the zipper. Take my boots off at every customer's home and they are fast to get on and off.", "No support for a brand new boot it\u2019s not a matter of breaking it in. They bend and pinch the ankles and the inside of the arches and you can feel a stone through the bottom of a brand new sole. Don\u2019t waste your money !", "They are surprisingly difficult to keep properly tightened around my ankle, however, even then they are light, durable and easy to walk hills in. I\u2019d buy another pair!", "Good product for the type of boot i love the zipper on the side but i would probably not order again just because of the materials used they wouldnt last as long as my 40 dollar survivors from wallmart with steel toes", "Purchased boots to wear on a 2 week trip to Uruguay, then a trip to Portugal. boots lasted less than 2 weeks walking around Uruguay. While the boots still look great, the left heal separated from the boot. Junk.", "I Bought these for my 10 year old for Christmas to help him with his \u201cjob\u201d he\u2019s a safety at school (he takes this very seriously). He loves them! My husband who\u2019s a police officer even said they look like good quality and the side zipper is bonus.", "Awesome !!!! This boot actually gives me mobility back with no back pain after long hours of landscaping. Was surprised at its water resistance during this past snow storm and snow blowing operations. People even stop me in the store asking about where did I get these. They are shocked at the quality and affordable price", "Only use these when motorcycle riding in Florida winters but they really wouldn't hold up to daily use for very long. They work for my intermittent use and are just average.", "Worked for my academy setting with lots of running and jumping jacks. They held up well and were able to attain a high shine on the toe with some work. The lining of the insoles came off, which meant a sticky feeling for a day or two, but you can always replace insoles.", "This is a great pair of boots it's my third ones I bought and they do only last a year in construction but taking them off with a zipper is the best :-)", "2nd time buying. Wore the first pair for 3 years until one of the soles completely fell off. Super comfortable and the zipper means you only have to tie them once. Hard to beat for the price.", "I love these shoes. However, the first thing I did when I bought this shoes was buy another set of insoles. I am on my feet in these boots 12 hours a day and the insoles that came in the boots were like little pieces of cardboard, they were hard and flat. I put in a pair of insoles from Wally World called Avia. The boots can be polished, unzip on the side, and lace all the way up. I plan to purchase another pair soon.", "I use these to schlep around town, they are OK on comfort, OK on fit, they scuff easily, and the sole is starting to come loose, with pretty light use. If I were an EMT or a Cop and used these hard day in and day out, I would expect to get maybe one month out of them.", "I love the boot style. I ordered a 15 med. Tried on when they arrived. I will need a 15 wide. I will exchange my 15 medium for the like item size 15wide.", "Becareful when purchasing these boots. I have never had any issues with toe pain until I started wearing these boots. The toe box is very narrow.", "complete crap, i ordered the widest ones i could and they were still too narrow. i wore them anyway so they could stretch out and fit better, but after a month some of the grommets for the laces tore through the fabric (fake leather) and the whole thing is about to fall apart. i would not buy again nor would i take another pair for free, useless.", "I've been wearing tactical boots for ten years now. I ve had Bates, 511, Tanners, Timberland tactical ect... I was apprehensive purchasing boots online, however these are the most comfortable boots yet. I ve had these for one month and my feet are good. I work two 16hr shift a week and my feet do not ache. They are lightweight, comfrotable and easy to put on. Zipper is great quality compared to other boots Ive owned. I do buy a size larger and put my own inserts which make my feet feel like im walking on clouds. I would deffinently recommend these boots. Very comfrtable", "I expected the feeling of the real combat boots, but this one is somewhat not like that. It is good boots though, there are too much room for the necks above the ankle. I usually wear from 8.5 to 9.5 depends on the brand, and I ordered 9ee which fit fine with some extra room for my feet. Bit the neck.... that is too bad. I cannot run with this boots. Hope it can last heavy snow coming soon here.", "The boots look and feel great to wear however mine are already losing the stitching on one of the boots. Defective or just not the quality they claim to be. I have worn them 10 times since my purchase a couple months ago.", "Cool boots. They fit and feel like tennis shoes. I used them in Africa building a school. No foot injuries. Everyone wanted them just for the way they looked.", "Thought it said weather proof but feet get cold and wet. They are comfortable and quick and easy to get on. Fair price for the product.", "I am usually size 9 US, but in this case it feels like 9.5 US, so i had vcd to return for exchange but not decided as of yet. Solid durable shoes.", "Great boots felt great right out of the box. After a full day of work I'm happy to say no aches and pains. I will say to invest in a pair of insoles for arch support. Overall happy with purchase and will buy again once these run their course.", "Update: 3 months of use at 3 days a week and the toes are worn out. The outer layer is off. Also the soles wore down about a month ago. You get what you pay for so we are going back to the more expensive brand. ( Prior review: 4 stars- Been wearing these about 3 weeks now. So far so good for a big man who stands on his feet all day.)", "The sand color is a little light bit over all good duty boots Not built for hi test jobs but not bad for office work days", "fits solid, easy to put on with side zipper, keeps feet warm and dry but not slip resistant. I almost fell more then enough times with these things on at work. the floor gets wet and slippery so i want to let ya know these dont have a grip and all with wet floors. Be careful when thinking about getting these if you work in areas with wet floors. it has no grip so i slip.", "These boots came fast, and they are as expected, really descriptive I know. My shoe size is 11.5 so I ordered the 11.5 2E US, and although they fit, it's a little tight, but manageable. I'll be sure to get a 12/2E or so the next time! Over all, decently made and as solid as can be! P.S. not a huge fan of the laces that came with them, so I used the black laces of my previous set of shoes.", "These are military rated? They\u2019re falling apart on the bottom seam. Water gets in them. False advertising about \u201c life span\u201d on product. Very disappointed. Do NOT purchase these boots!", "Boot feels good to walk in and do not weigh a lot but may have too much padding at the top of the boot. It could be hot when warm weather hits. As far as durability, I haven't had them long enough.", "These boots run smaller, it seems, than the desert tan ones i bought which are great. I bought another pair of black ones, which we slightly different (extra side lace eye) i had to send back because they were way too small. I'm keeping these to see if they will wear better after a while. The tan ones i ordered months ago were very comfortable right out of the box. These weren't but i hope after breaking them in they will be. Beware there is a difference in size between tan and black in these boots.", "These boots were ordered for a friend of mine. I asked him to rate the quality, fit, practicality, and cost. \"Feels great, looks great. At first I thought they were going to fit a bit small but with wearing them with a thinner pair of socks , I feel that they fit almost perfect.\" The zipper is a big plus with these boots. Made of durable material, easy on and off. We are glad we were able to find these on the Amazon site. Amazon is a great company and we like the service and products they carry. Looking forward to owning a second pair.", "I like these boots, very comfortable. First boots I've ever had with laces AND zipper, and at my age, that's very convenient! I've had them a little over 6 months, have worn them nearly every day. About 4 months in, I noticed sole stitching starting to appear at the toes, the pics show where they're at at 6 months. Will see how long these last...may buy more, may not. I'm on the fence.", "Not too bad. Only reason so low rating is because you can see the glue they used to stick the sole to shoe on the actual shoe so it makes them look cheap but hopefully they last", "I really like these boots with the ease of the side zipper will be using at the range for PPC they are very lightweight the size 11.5 is just big enough for me.", "These are good boots, I like the way they look and they surprised me over the past few months. I would recommend, these are great for the price, way more than i expected.", "These are the most comfortable boot that I have ever owned. I speak from experience. military and civilian for over 40 years. High quality well made. I would recommend them to all.", "Beware, boot has a 1 year warranty (at least in writing but seemingly not in actuality). My zipper broke within this period, contacted the manufacturer, no response. Contacted the seller, no response.", "I had a pair of 5.11s that inhad for years and they finally broke down. Was on a budget and saw these. I was hesitant but I am very glad I gave them a chance. They fit and feel just like my 5.11s and at about 1/3 the price. I plan to get the black version next for work.", "I was very happy with the quality of this boot, and it fit just as I had expected. I wear a size 12 shoe and these boots fit very nicely. They also had a very nice insole in them, but I did replace the original Insoles with some Dr. Scholl\u2019s gel insoles.", "Maybe I should of got a 10.5 vs 11 but I have a medium weight sock on so I can live with the extra room around arch/toe areas. But overall the boot was well packaged and arrived as expected. The boots are LIGHT weight compared to a off brand i had a few years ago. I didn't expect them to be so feather light so its an extra bonus. For the price I'd buy again.", "Great for the money. Bought these for just walking around work boots. Dont know how they'll hold up long term. But they're pretty comfortable and the side zip works great.", "I usually take a 8 1/2 XXX so I bought a 9 W. They sate a little tight but I am hoping they will stretch ad I wear them in.", "I've had these for a month now and they're holding up well so far. I work in extreme conditions and they are warm without insulated socks. I walk between 6-14 miles every shift at work and these are pretty comfortable with insoles. The only downside is that they are not great for deep water or snow as it seeps through the zipper and tongue.", "Good boots other than after 7 months the laces disintegrated into pieces and after 8 months the sole is starting to pull away from the leather. I keep getting small rocks inside them now. I'm thinking a little shoe goo will fix that. The tread holds up well and doesn't seem to have signs of cracking. With the new Kevlar laces they are better.", "I've been wearing these same boots for 8 years. The first pair lasted 3 years, 2nd pair lasted 5 years (zipper broke today.) Ordering my 3rd pair now. I wear these to work everyday and they only suffer mild wear and tear but they are comfortable and reliable. Can't beat the price for the quality.", "I own the tan version and love them, but they are 14 wides and I needed 15 wides now. So I got the 15 W in black, but they fit nearly the exact same as the 14 W set do. Since they don't come any larger not much to be done about it, just be aware when ordering you may need bigger than you think.", "This shoe was comfortable right out of the box. I am very happy with them and would buy again. I have been wearing them for the past two months.", "Really happy with these shoes. True to size, kind of roomy around the ankles but lacing it up tight helps! Really comfortable, havent used them in the field yet. Leather/mesh feels like lower quality but for 70 bucks it is good. inly complain is on the rear end my shoe had some white glue near the sole. Hopefully it isnt noticeable. Ill update in a few months for wear and tear.", "Warm, comfortable, lightweight, and durable. Tie them up once, and then just use the zipper/velcro combo to easily slip them on and off. Good tread on the bottom of the boot as well. Money well spent UPDATED: Waterproof lasted for about 5-6 months, and didn't start falling apart at the toes until a year later. What happened to boots that lasted 2-3 years? I guess you get what you pay for", "Boots look and feel okay, except you get a funny sensation after wearing for long (8) hours. But I think it's because it's not broken in. This is the 2nd time wearing the boots and the zipper won't pull close on the right pair. So far I don't see any information for exchange or returns. If anyone has information about exchanges or returns please share.", "It fits just as I thought it would, however around the left boot, I would get a pinch on my smallest toe every time I'd place a bit of pressure there, but a slight home brewed fix took care of that. I have no problem with the boots, but perhaps some good, comfortable soles may help in the future.", "Great build, comfortable, and cool looking to boot (pun intended). I should note that I ordered the 11D once and it was too large. 10.5D fit much better. My only dislike is that the toe guard has a line in the interior that causes some mild discomfort if you're crouching on the the toe too far. The discomfort is quite mild though, and you'll most likely not encounter this unless you're doing airsoft, milsim, or something requiring an unusual foot placement. Great boots for the price.", "Right boot arrived with the tongue stitching coming apart. Will need to replace these boots ASAP. I will update the review when and if the company does anything to fix the situation.", "I haven't worn them to work yet so i can't speak on the wear and tear, however I am a size 10.5/11 wide women's and I ordered a 9 mens regular width and they're narrow and small. Reordered 9.5 wide and the width is perfect and I have extra room for thick socks. I also tried the 5.11 tactical and the size 9 regular width fits perfectly.", "Boots are junk! They lasted 4 months after I received them and I was off work for 1 month of those. The sole fell apart. Don't recommend these boots.", "The boot is nice but, the toe leather is exceptionally thin and scuffed through in a few days. Not bad for the money", "Love these boots, I have cerebral palsy, so I'm hard on shoes. I usually can see wear within daysin the sole.. These, other then the mud, paint, scrape marks and other inflicted damage are perfect. I was talked into Dr Martin's but I needed to drive 70 miles ond way to get them. I was going to do that for a quality shoe even pay more then I ever had for shoes, then I saw these. They are amazing for me not only because the sole is tough, but the zip on the side, it makes it much easier to get on and off. These are my daily, go to shoes.", "I'm putting 3 stars, because I am happy with the fit and feel of these boots. The only thing that I am not happy about, is the fact on some surfaces these boots are not slip resistant. Wet bathroom tile floors are dangerous to walk on with these. I feel like a newborn calf trying to walk to the toilet at work. Overall the boots are good, but their slip resistant nature isn't. I'm going to have to find another pair of boots that doesn't slip so much. I can't afford to fall and get hurt at work.", "My husband loves these boots to wear around! He has feet problems, and these are very comfortable for him to wear all day. He wanted another pair immediately after buying the first pair.", "Love these boots. I hiked 145 miles on the Appalachian Trail in 2weeks in these and they held up great, I still wear them (laces are weak though). They are more comfortable and lighter than 511's. My wife's a cop and she even likes them better because of the weight and comfort.", "I would say this is a fair boot at best. The price fit my budget but it definitely needs to be treated with a waterproofing substance. There are definitely better boots out there .", "Good product for the price. Wanted something comfortable for standing long periods and moving around. These are light weight and good to walk in. I ordered 1/2 size larger and probably didn't need to but I put a cushion insert in the boots and the comfort level is good so far. Don't know about the water resistance yet.", "I've only been wearing them a little over a week but they feel amazing. Comfortable through out the whole day. Tie up once then zip on zip off. Nice insole and feel. I definitely would order a 1/ 2 size over what you normally wear depending on the thickness of the boot sock you use. For the money it's an outstanding product. I have been wearing about 9 months now and the thread and glue on the soles are coming undone also the eyelets are pulling out. I have not been abusive on the boots. I think they should have lasted longer.", "OMG!! I cannot say enough positive about these boots.... they are unbelievably great! I have bad foot drop on my left ankle and finding a lightweight yet supportive boot/shoe has been a 5 year lesson in futility and these boots have solved that issue completely!!! They're just the right height, just the right width(2E), and the comfort and walkability is second to none. I'm half tempted to immediately buy another pair a stick them in the closet!", "The Boots looks somewhat okay. Although they do NOT feel 100% comfortable. However I\u2019m still going to keep them because I do NOT want to go through the whole sending back process. However I\u2019m just REALLY disappointed that my package came damage. And I noticed certain things on the boots that I wasn\u2019t happy about. I spent a fair amount for the boots and I expected good quality which unfortunately I personally feel I did not receive. But whoever is doing the packaging I\u2019ll like them to be more careful in the near future. I\u2019m excited about my boots , but highly disappointed at the same time about my package being damaged.", "The boost do fit but they were not new as advertised. Dirt inside the boost and on the bottom of them. Plus scuff marks showing that they had been worn.", "I love the look of the boot however there is a an issue with the sizing. I wear a size 10 and the 10s were way to tight. I went to a size 101/2 and they were longer but the width pinched my toes. (I don't have a wide foot) I sent those back for 11s and unfortunately after a couple of wears, they are to large...I'll now have to purchase inserts and wear thick sox. I know they would be great if only they fit.. Now I'm stuck with a pair of boots and out $59.00.", "These boots are very comfortable and lightweight. I am on my feet 10 to 13 hours a few days a week and zero fatigue. One important thing to note is they are a good dry traction boot, but not completely slip resistant. So beware when trying to navigate wet or oily floors.", "I really like these boots. Currently have them put up with a foot stretching apparatus as they are slightly tight at the end on my toes. My fault entirely as I ordered a size US 11.5 & should have gone for the size US 12 because it is a boot! They are well manufactured. I have had a black leather pair before which were wonderful. Particularly like the side zipper for ease of on / off. Recommend these boots!", "I think this product is good, but my husband said they were too tight so I will be returning them to you. The first try they were too small so I sent them back. and now I will send the second try back to you all.", "I work outdoors and in greenhouses in the PNW. It's the rainy season, so work has become a mud and puddle pit. I wouldn't say these are water proof but water-resistant is more accurate. I've stepped in a few deep puddles and haven't come out soaked. They seem durable (I've only had them for two months) and are fairly comfortable, putting an insert in wouldn't be the worst thing. All-in-all, pretty happy with the purchase. Can't beat it, for the price.", "The boots fit nicely and look good, the sizes are exactly normal. However, there was one flaw, in the left shoe there was a piece on the inside that was folded up under the leather and the lining of the boot that rubbed on my foot for a few days causing a sore spot on my foot. But once they were worn for about a week the folded section no longer touches my foot. As for the packaging it caught me off guard because they were shipped in the shoe box... They did arrive I damaged even tho the box looked beat to death. Good boots so far.", "I like them a lot. The general questions for the review don\u2019t give it justice. It seems to be a fairly nice quality boot. Will post again after they\u2019ve had some steps put on them.", "I bought these to work in. The inserts were like concrete. I bought better inserts and the boots have been great!!.", "Great product and seller. They returned my original order which was too large and 2 days later the best fit came...thanks...", "Great boots for $50. Work boots for 5 months. Work in mud, dirt, climb ladders, and very little wear. Zippers still work good. The interior souls are starting to come apart a bit though. They don't get too hot. Would recommend.", "The first 4 hours my boyfriend wore these boots all the eyelets began to come apart on the right boot. After wearing them for a total of 18 hours the soles separated at the heals on both boots. They were a total waste of money. I would rate them zero stars or a star minus.", "I am really happy with the Maelstrom boots. They are a little narrower than expected, I'll just get wider pair next time, and one of the heel wasn't flat and it felt like walking with a rock stuck in the tread. The boots are really comfortable, like wearing sneakers, and real easy to put on and take off with the side zipper. I will get more.", "Theses shoes are awful. The fit was okay but they have already started falling apart. In addition mold has started growing inside. They just have to be thrown away. Very disappointed to have spent almost $60 on a 10 week long lasting pair of shoes. I wouldn\u2019t recommend.", "I bought them for my husband and he loves them! They are Light weight, breathe great and has a side zipper for convenience. I was worried about dirt caus of color and rough side leather out. But the dirt matches the color and you just brush them off with SOFT brush. I would recommend a proper shoe cleaning kit like danner sells", "Ok so far. Not real comfortable but not terrible either. Added padded insoles helped. Woul give 3 1/2 if possible.", "Very good boot so far was very surprised at how well they are made for the price and very comfortable wearing boot also", "Nice grippy rubber soles. Base insert is crap. Get new one asap. It has virtually no arch support. Otherwise they've been real good so far", "These things are cheap , cheap cheap!!. I bought 2 pair , there comfortable, but quantity is not what these are . The Velcro is coming off. the boot lase holes are tearing open, after very light use also I must say. Very disappointed!!!! I will show you in the photos , If I could I would send them back for a full refund would! But I only started wearing them and that time has come and gone. Buyer Beware!!!! Your getting what you pay for cheap. No good boots cost 59.99, they cost more!!", "I\u2019ve owned these boots for ONLY 2 months and there is no tread left on the soles and I work at a carwash and my feet are so soaked within the first half hour of work and getting worse day by day. These boots are by far the worst investment I\u2019ve ever takin a risk on! I wouldn\u2019t recommend these boots to an enemy...I wish there was a way to leave a picture of how quickly these boots went from great to worst ever.", "Great looking Boot, fits well and comfortable, however, the left boot started squeaking severely after about a little more than a week of wearing and since they were solely for work, unfortunately, I had to stop wearing them, it drove me crazy. I tried to fix it myself, but the squeak was actually in the sole of the boot, not the insert.", "These boots are awesome. They are super easy to get into and out of. They're lightweight and comfortable. Much lighter than my issued boots. I've unfortunately had to return them because they're a little short and when I blouse my trousers they slip off the top. So I'd say that they're about 6\" instead of 8\".", "These boots were comfortable from the minute I put them on. Only wore them for a few hours that day but no break in was needed. What was amazing was the light weight of these boots. Most other brands that I've worn over the years must have weighed twice what these do. Think I'm going to like these boots even more once I wear them a tad more.", "awesome boots.. they are built tough.. they are super comfortable. good breathablility and have a microbiology barrier that stops bacteria.. great grip. love the thick YKK zipper.. for the price, these are some of the best boots I've ever owned. price or not,,they're still some of the best boots I've owned.. can't say enough about them.. worn everyday for 3 weeks now, and they haven't dissapointed at all !!", "Not bad for the price but you get what you pay for. They were great wearing them daily for work but started to come apart on the sides after about two months. My guess is they won\u2019t make it past a year with regular use.", "Don't waste your money on this boot. Its a cheap boot that the sole comes apart from the rest of the boot within the first month, and by that time the warranty is over, and you are stuck with the boots. I purchased my boots last January because of the price, and I just started wearing them less than a month ago, and they have came attached from the rest of the boots.", "would like the tongue a bit longer, but that is all that I see that could change. the comfort of the insoles is super after 10 hours they still have a cushion feel to them, like walking on air . would buy again. great boot and price", "I was looking at a boot that cost 2x what this did but based on the ratings I decided to give this pair a try. Fit seems to run true in US size, construction and finish are good. I would have preferred a better seal on the zipper but that's on me as these were not claimed to be waterproof. Comfort is good, as well. The real test will be this winter when I'm in and out of the truck in all kinds of slop trying to stay vertical, but the tread looks like it should handle most conditions.", "My Husband really needed some tactical boots for work , so i Opted for this brand and Hes grateful to have them", "These are great boots. Some of the most comfortable I've ever stepped in to be honest with you. To the people who said they aren't comfortable clearly didn't get the right size. Love the zipper aspect makes taking them on and off a breeze. Very nice color. Only complaint is they allow stains to easily. Other than that, they're well worth the money.", "For the price they are excellent. I am currently wearing them. I love the zipper. I have a recurring ankle injury, so the hi ankle support is great. They are as light as my mid height hiking boots. The traction is excellent. They are not too hot. I can stand in them for long periods of time, I did however have to replace the insole which I do for all my shoes, but that is not a reflection on the manufactures stock insole, it is force of habit. I do plan on purchasing these again when these wear out.", "One month review- So far, so good. Easy break in. Decent support. Everything seems to be doing it's job with a few little problems here and there (loose threads, misaligned stitching, etc.) No frills boots at a really good price point. At this moment, will definitely buy again. For reference- I walk about 40-45 miles (60-70 km) a week for work, both indoors and out, rain or shine.", "Comfortable is key and they are very much so..... I had a pair of Rothco Zip up and they lasted 4 years of use. I didn't wear them everyday, but when I was outdoors, camping, mowing the lawn etc. These appear to be better built. WE will see. I'll try to update the usage and wear soon. 07/20/2016 update...boots are worn out and falling apart. The Rothco lasted longer. I ordered a pair of Magnum Men's Response III 8.well see what happens. I have given up on the Maelstrom brand.", "Very disappointed in the LACK of durability. My husband wore these for 3 1/2 months and they came apart where the leather meets the rubber sole on both shoes. Will definitely NEVER BUY these again. VERY POORLY MADE! He wore them outside while working in the yard and playing with the dog. He has a desk job, so it's not like he had excessive wear.", "A little shorter than 5.11 boots and the finish is really dull. Far more difficult to get a good shine than 5.11 boots. Overal, at half the price and similar comfort it's a good value. Let's see how long they last.", "This is a nice comfortable boot. I am on the 12 1/2 size but these 12 E's fit nicely. I will be using them mostly for motorcycle riding. Good protection. The zipper is a great feature. I can keep the laces tied and still get it on easily.", "As advertised, properly sized wide fit boots. Easy to put on and take off with the zipper on the side.", "I actually don't know if this boot fits, but I was nice enough to buy these boots for somebody and he CONSTANTLY BITCHED about them! So I figured I would write a great review of these boots to because he whined so much about getting free boots.", "Pro: Nice design concept with the zipper on the side for quick access to take on and off. Con: Would trust this shoe for work related usage. The arch support doesn't last long. And, the velcro attachment at the top of the shoe doesn't last long.", "Fair price AND came on time. THE ZIPPER is a time saver and works well. Hoping they last well~", "These are the most comfortable boots I've ever had on, lace them up just once and then use the zipper each time to take on and off, great design. been doing a lot of demolition work and they are holding up beautiful. Thank you for making such a great product!", "I just received mine in the mail yesterday. Went with regular shipping and I had them delivered in 4 days. I didn't get home till late last night so I've only Checked the quality of build and tried them on. Fit is fine. I purchased mine for work. Done paying $100 or more for boots that get wreaked and I only wear for work. For a total price of $60 delivered to my door these boots look and feel like they'll be my new brand of work boot. I've also spent 6 years in the Army an an Infantryman so I know the importance of a good boot. Will recommend to my coworkers.", "I don't do anything crazy with these boots I mainly wear them to office so I wont talk about durability, these boots are comfortable, I stand in train for about an hour everyday and they are very comfortable, they are not too hot which is great for people like me who wear these to work.... not very good for driving (specially stick shift) not heavy, you don't need to break them in and they are pretty good in rain.", "Very comfortable. Light. Fit as expected. Using them as motorcycle riding boots. I recommend", "I like these boots but they fit loose in the heel on me. I use them for motorcycling and they have worked fine but are not on the same quality as top of the line boots. For the price I think they are worth it.", "The left boot fits fine, the right boot fits to small, left size 10, right size 9.5. that is why I had to send it back", "Appears to be of good quality. Normally I wear a 10.5 wide shoe. Ordered these in 11 wide and I\u2019m glad I did! Don\u2019t think a 10.5 would have fit.", "I returned the boots because they were so bulky around the cushion portion of the top. Quality was acceptable.", "Definitely order a full size larger I ordered mine a size larger as recommended by a reviewer and even then I would like them to be a half size bigger hopefully they'll stretch out with use", "These boots are very comfortable to wear, I wear them on my motorcycle all the time. They are comfortable but also feel very sturdy and durable. It is a great buy for the price. It feels like you have a pair of $100+ boots on your feet at a fraction of the price.", "Seemed like a decent boot but not very breathable. Feet got hot and damp which then made them cold. I do not have this problem with most boots. The liner in the toe area wore through after about 15 uses and exposed a grippy rubber surface inside. I am going to toss these boots that look new on the outside. True to size.", "One of the eyelets ripped out on the second time I use them. I like the looks of the boot, but the quality is horrible.", "The size of 10.5 \"Wide\" is the size of my work boots. They're 4 yrs old and their still snug. These boots are good a good fit at the angle and above but to wide at the food level. They are much lighter than my other boots. I'll try them with a thicker pair of socks.", "I ordered these a few months back and have just begun wearing them as winter set in here in Colorado. These are by far the best pair of boots I've ever owned and a great value. They are lightweight and comfortable.

However, after 3 months of use, the sole split up by the toe of the boot. The sole is only 1/8\" thick, if it looks thicker it is simply cosmetic.

They've been in all sorts of terrain, in all sorts of conditions, from ambulance scenes, to fire scenes, and more. They've held up very well.

I also noticed I don't experience any knee, hip, or back pain from long days in these which is great cause my knees are terrible.

Not bad overall though.", "I purchased these in late October and have been wearing them consistently since then. The fit is pretty much perfect, there was virtually no break in period, and they are definitely light weight. Unfortunately I'm not impressed with the build quality so far, as one of the lacing eyelets on the right foot has widened and is tearing the hole/becoming oblong. I am not LE or Military, nor do I work construction or any other profession that mandates heavy use of foot wear, so for a normal guy like me to get a sign of wear like this from everyday light usage... well, I'm bit disappointed to say the least.", "Feels like my toes are getting crushed I wear a size 10 wide .which is what I ordered but there too short .Not laced correctly either", "My husband was not pleased because this boot at all , he says is not comfortable at all,", "The product itself is good.

I plan on wearing these as my Motorcycle Boots so I don't know yet how the soles will hold up, but they look great, feel great and the soles seem to be high quality and holds a great grip. I tested the grip of these boots by pouring motor oil on an old backhoe windshield and believe it or not; they gripped like a beast! I've never had a pair of boots grip as good as these before.

They held up for about 6 months then the suede tore near the heel. I had planned on sending them back, but my wife bought me the same boots as a gift, because she knew how much I loved them. The second pair was no where near as comfortable and fit differently even though they are the same size. My son has the same boots and really likes them. He wore them on a 40 mile section hike of the AT with no problems, and no blisters.", "I bought these boots after owning a pair of 8\" Brazos. I work for a fire department and I tend to be on my feet for most of the day. When they arrived, they were a little stiff, but I figured they needed some breaking in.

Quality product, fast shipping, AWESOME customer service. I will definitely be a repeat customer.", "The sole of this boot has started to separate from the boot. Not just on one but both. I wear them at my shop for work and all I do is walk. All day. Do not recommend even for the price.", "My son hasn't had these boots very long and they're already falling apart. The stitching next to the zipper, in spots, didn't even stay on the fabric that now brings the white foam cushioning into sight. Then there's loose threads on the sole, will be returning them.", "Bought these on the wide side just in case I needed extra socks for winter. They seem to be allright, but only time will tell. there is a crinkle on the top of the left boot, that in my experience has generally lead to a crack. So far they are comfortable, good traction and the zipper works well. Shipping was excellent, and they arrived on time. Will replace the insole since the one provided is kind of hard on the ball of my feet.", "I ordered these in July and have been wearing them since. My college campus is huge, so I've done a lot of walking recently. There's now a big hole in the bottom of the inner sole right under my heel, which makes a lot of walking uncomfortable. Otherwise, they're really comfy. They just can't take a lot of abuse.", "Great boot for the price! Works well in cold weather and durable. Mesh on the sides allows for protection from the elements while providing ventilation to avoid \u201cswamp-feet\u201d. Overall very good and stylish.", "Great boots. Very light weight and comfortable, and, so far, completely waterproof. Wore all winter (1 hour daily, walking to and from public transportation, in frigid, sometimes negative degree weather). Easy on/off a huge plus. I hope they last forever, or, at least, are still available if/when the time comes to purchase again.", "They look nice and fit well. They are a little on the large side.

We had trouble with getting the first pair delivered but the company was easy to work with, and once he finally had the boots on, he was happy. We'd gotten the sand-colored ones before, and he wanted another pair to wear with his black jeans to work. They alleviate a lot of the leg pain he was having when walking before, due to the added support.", "I was siked to get them but not thrilled when they ran smaller than expected. Too tight and width wasn't as full as stated. Other than that well constructed and quality", "They look good on initial inspection, though after wearing once, I started to notice that the glued areas of upper and lower outsole was separated in areas, leaving gaps for water and dirt (see photos). I'm going to have to re-glue these myself, and that might be a nod to shoddy craftmanship. I thought o wasd getting a great deal on work footwear, and maybe that was too much to hope for.", "Day to day use it would be okay not so sure about any type of hard use", "LOVE these shoes. I have never worn Tac boots before, but I love boots, and these ones fit me well.

I really like them so far....I was on the fence to buy either the regular width or wide and went with wide and thank God I did because they're just a hair tight. I doubt I would have been able to get the normal width ones on.

But overall good fit", "the boot is sized large, but they were very uncomfortable and within an hour I decided they needed to go back", "I bought these for my son and he loves them. He said they are comfortable and lighter than the heavy leather ones, he used to buy. He waterproofed them because we live in Montana and its cold and lots of snow. He likes to wear them instead of his snow boots whenever he can. Really good fit for him and he uses extra thick winter socks with them.

My friends are buying them now", "I really can't believe how reliable these are. The quality seems amazing for the price, and actually in general for any price. They breathe more than I thought they would. They could have a tiny bit better traction on wet logs, but that's probably a job for a different type of boot, so no stars lost there.", "So disappointed. My son wears a 15, sometimes a 16.

The laces literally disintegrated after about 5 months of daily use while I was at work. the insoles are comfortable but the fabric came loose after a few weeks of daily wearing. I had some extra insoles laying around so no big deal. So make sure you have some spare laces handy, but other than that they are pretty comfortable and durable. I have worn the expensive Belleville's for the last 6 years but these are the best cheap boots you can get.", "I received my order today. love the fit and feel of them. I say if your 6' 1\" like me and have no foot problems order Size 10 .5 ! A perfect fit also well made ! I wore them since arrival and man they are the cat's meow in comfort. I'm a very detailed person and hard to please. If they would have given me a problem YOU would read it here. I may come back and let you know about the wear factor later. Thank you Maelstrom for a fine fitting product.", "The boots were lighter than I anticipated which I like. The fact that its light makes it easy to move.

They have a nice shine and texture and the comfort level is great.", "These used to be my favorite brand of work boots. They required no breaking in, were true to size and comfortable out of the box.

He has had foot problems all of his life, but he says these feel great. Nice look too.", "I use them around the shop, working in the yard, hiking w/ the dogs. Good fit, and comfortable. I found they run true to size. I like the side zip entry. I did put in an innersole for a bit more cushioning on the feet.

I normally wear a men's 8 but went up a half size. Even with sizing up, I can't wear any of my winter socks with these--I have to wear my thinnest cotton socks for a comfortable fit. Breaking them in is proving quite easy and I hope they'll stand up to the wear and tear of brutal kitchen work.", "They fit fine however they do not last. Within 9-10 months they were completely useless. The laces on both shoes broke within a week of each other around the 6 month mark. I have never had to replace laces in any of my shoes before.

Gave it four stars as I have not seen these perform at a lower temperature.", "They were tight in the middle. The left boot tongue fabric ripped open exposing the white filling inside. This just happened through regular walking. No strenuous work. I'm still using them because they are slowly fitting and adjusting to my feet. I like the overall ease of slipping these on and just zipping them on in the morning. I would recommend for those without wide feet.", "Not for the Professional. I've had them two weeks and they breath good and are comfortable however they're already wearing out in stitching a\u0301reas and inside the boot aswell. Im 6ft1 220lbs and use them in the desert also do not get them wet!", "Very good product for the price. They look like they will wear very well.", "Less than 6 months and the boot has fallen apart. From the toe to mid fit is split, the bottom grip of the boot came completely apart from the boot. I read the reviews, read they had good support and fit well, and they do not. Heres to another $100 pair of boots going to the garbage can.", "I can say i like the boots but mine I've only wore for 2 weeks and the stitching is already coming out on the sides of the soles on both boots very disappointing.", "The first pair had stitching at toe cone loose. Hopefully this pair will fair better.", "I am on my second pair of these. The first pair lasted me a year. They cost about as much as a pair of running shoes and last about as long. Super comfortable right out of the box. Light weight. The zipper on the side is fantastic. Easy on-easy off. Never have to tie the laces. Great bang for the buck.", "Great boot very comfortable. Once you lace them up you can take them on and off by only using the zipper.", "THESE ARE VERY NICE< OUR #rd pair, get them! 50 bucks cheaper than at the local discount store", "to early to tell but so far so good, before wearing them , I chose to spray water protectant to help keep them clean and give extra water protection, I wore them all day walking all over and they were just fine, the second day I wore them out on a short 2 mile walk up and down hills and they wore well.", "Tight in the ankle mostly, hard to keep the boot tied and use the zipper", "fits as described and durable for working in any conditions", "Boot is not water proof horrible experience while being outside a majority of the day in the snow and rain my feet were pretty much soaked and frozen inside the boot.", "I've had the boots for 9 months used only for walking. They are coming apart at the seem where my right toe would touch the boot. I like the boots but i wouldn't buy again. My last pair of (good) boots lasted me 3 years. Man I miss those bates", "Three long years with these wonderful wonderful boots. Finally the sole has one single crack in it after hardworking in these boots for three whole years.", "Folks they are a great value for work or play, zipper sides make them easy on east off. Buy a set you will love them.", "My husband says these are very comfortable boots, he can wear them all day with no problems. He rides his motorcycles, works around the yard and everything else in these boots so they must be comfortable. He highly recommends them.", "so far these have fit as expected, are easy on/off with the side zipper. I've had other boots that were hard with the laces tight to get boot off, but these were a very good quality, so far, and the price is very good. Im interested to see how they hold up to patrol in a hot environment. will update", "These boots are fine. Great for outdoors and general use but they are NOT oil resistant. Not great for use in a shop or motorcycle. Otherwise they are comfortable.", "My husband does construction so he's on his feet all day. He loves them.", "Bough these for my boyfriend when he had hand surgery and could not tie his shoes. They fit so good and are so comfortable that I had to order him another pair.", "This looked great but never could get them to feel great. Always had very sore feet (usually top of foot) after wearing them. The window to return them is up -- bummer -- -I just kept trying to break them in. Back to buying Bates.", "As a corrections officer, I spend a lot of time on my feet. These are the best boots I have ever wore on the job. They are all I have used for three years now.", "This is my husband's second pair. He has the tan and the black. He says they're the most comfortable boots he has ever owned. He wears them to ride his motorcycle. He normally wears a sz 13, and he bought 13's and they fit as expected.", "I like these boots. Very light and comfortable. They run about a half size small, I wear a ten in most boots and needed a 10.5. I am not sure how well these will hold up, but at the price, If they last a year or so, I can afford to replace.", "I've been wearing the TAC FORCE 8 boots for a couple of months before writing a review. This boot has been very comfortable and cool during very hot summer weather that involved a lot of walking on both lawn and pavement surfaces. Construction @ workmanship is excellent, and they have held up well under daily use. I wear a size 8 and I ordered size 8.5 from other user recommendations to go half a size up. Perfect fit :-) Excellent value for the money compared to other boots costing 2 to 3 times the price !!!!", "Super comfortable boots. Lightweight and appear to be put together well. The zipper makes it super easy to kick them off and put them on. That will be handy since they have very good tread which could really track in the house when it's messy outside and get me in trouble. Best value that I have found on a boot like this yet.", "They are a bit on the warm side and would be better suited for cooler and even temporary cold weather. The fit is nice and the side zipper is a must. The only problem was the first time I tried to tie the shoes the shoestring broke on one of the shoes.", "Nice lock , but uncomfortable and Painful tingling while walking in Bottom leg looks like filles with prickles Couldn't not complete my day with this boot", "They lasted 6 months, but that's with 5-6 miles a day. I'm a janitor working for a huge corporation. 6 months is a long time for these boots. Now i need another pair, they're comfortable and fit as they say, just no arch support. Other than that, great boots.", "It fits great and I feel like I can walk oin all types of terrain with them. The only issue that I have with them is the fact that the left shoe laces was awfully smaller then the one the right shoe. It makes me squeeze harder to properly tie the boot.", "I work in security so I do allot of walking around and I'm on my feet. The boots themselves are light weight which is a good thing and they do have good traction on them and I like how you can just unzip them and slip your feet into them. The problem I had was their in sole support which painfully pressed my feet inside the boots into the upper rim of my boots. This was easily fixed I removed the in sole support and replaced it with Doctor Soles which fixed the problem. But without any sole support inserts insides the boots themselves are flat.", "I could not get the boot on my feet 15\u201d wide no way", "These boots fit well and go on fast. They are really comfortable and they provide a lot of ankle support. I could walk around in these all day. Really durable boots. I do a lot of running, sliding, jumping, and put them through loads of other abuse and they've held up to all of it.", "Had the first pair 2 years. Love the zip up side. Will continue to buy them as long as they sell them.", "After using them for a few years! They still do the job! Need more.", "Well only Two weeks in and I've done the damage. A bit of thread was coming off my sole in the front and the insoles are coming off from the heel, Easy to fix, but a tad annoying.. All and all not bad for what I've paid for. Fits and feels wonderful. But the real test is the test of Time and how they hold up. I will also be updating this as the time goes on.", "Ordered these boots for my son who is in Alabama Fireman\u2019s College, and he is very pleased with his new boots.", "I have oddly wide feet. It's difficult for me to find any foot-ware that doesn't hurt. These are the most comfortable pair of boots I have. I will be water-proofing the boots for long winter excursions. I keep these in my trunk just in case my work shoes aren't appropriate for whatever I find myself doing after work.", "The boot is comfortable. After 2 days of use the boots felt very comfortable and ready to go. The boots have been in the field during Search and Rescue training. I have better boots that cost 2-3x times more. These boots are a good value.", "Easy to don/doff because of the side zipper. User does not have to tie/untie the boots. Works well with thick socks. Comfortable and good looking.", "Fit really well and lasted for 2 years I think.", "Great boot... As described, fit great. Still using them at work for 4 months now. Water resistant, comfortable. Will buy again.", "Great work boot on my feet 8 two 12 hours a day in mud and water and on asphalt they are holding up well", "I purchased this item for my husband, he just started wearing them last month first of all-go up one size up doesn't fit. since first day till now shoes gives him a bruised mark on his pinky and shoes material is the worst especially wear the shoe laces are. ripped in one shoe tie! worst product ever", "I saw these on TV and wanted a lighter boot that was easy to put on. This exceeds my expectations.", "So far these boots have been very nice to wear, although some padded inserts would go a long way. I'm not big on tying my shoes, so I really like the zipper. I do only wear them a couple of days a week, so they are not my daily shoes.", "Fit well, sturdy and great for cold, long walks, or hiking however, they are not water proof. Still feel water seep through, even just strolling in the rain.", "Boot fits great. Craftsmanship is great. Only issue I had were the inserts. Mine came with two left foot soles. I called the manufacturer and they were great. They are going to send me a new pair of inserts. Other than that great boot.", "These boots are amazing! Quick to put on and take off with the side zipper, but still a nice snug fit. Great for mud, water and snow (will keep feet warm in -15 degree weather with thin socks on). Traction is excellent in all types of weather.", "I have a pair of these already with steel toe. They are comfortable compared to other steel toe boots/shoes and this name brand seems to hold up well. I would buy this boot again.", "These are nice. I love the zip on/off. I worked in wet conditions one morning and they kept my feet nice and dry. They are cool on hot days. They fit nicely although I did order them a half size bigger there the perfect fit. Light weight too.", "These boots we so comfortable right out of the box that you would think you were wearing them for months already. After wearing them around the house for a while as suggested, I went for a walk, about 45 minutes. I could feel the cushion in the heel with each step. Great boots and I would buy them again. I thought the 8\" would be too high but they were perfect. Big smile for me.", "These aren't the best boots I've ever worn, but they are pretty good for their reasonable price. The materials are sturdy and the sizing is accurate. They aren't highly comfortable for me, but that's a risk of buying shoes online. I expect the fit to improve as the boots break in. The big selling point of these boots for me is the zipper. Other boots in this category have side zippers, but I've had those cheap, lightweight zippers break within a few months. These have beefy, full-tooth zippers which are unlikely to fail anytime soon.", "Foot is vary close to size the ankle is vary small, like a Japanese man, not large muscled American", "easy break in, zipper side works well. order at least 1/2 size larger as they do run a little small. overall a very good value for the money.", "for the first time trying them on, very impressed. tightened them to a comfortable tightness zipper, worked great easy slide in and out for quick response, as I wanted. only down fall, absolutely no arch support. If they hold up and I have to pay $10 for some insoles I won't be disappointed at all, I'll continue to buy them for that price.", "Fits just about right on size. Great quality product. Have not had any issues yet. If I have one comment, it might be for the Velcro over the zipper to be a little better quality or larger, but it hasn't given me an issue yet. Time will tell.", "I wish the side strap was button instead of Velcro. the Velcro frays and curls after a while, a button would be more secure. these are comfortable and waterproof, good traction and ankle support.", "Wore these things for 18 hours a day for two weeks. Still holding up, but the shoelaces are starting to fray, the rings on the side of the shoe that hold the laces in have rusted underneath, and a seam on the tongue has come undone. They dry at a medium rate, nothing special. The Velcro that goes above the zipper on the side doesn't hold as well as it used to. Breaking them in was painful like with most shoes, but now they're comfortable. I'd go on a 15 mile hike in them easily.", "I have been wearing the boots for a few weeks now.. they fit great but they look tougher in picture than they are..they tend to get dirty ...they feel like suade on top and you can't clean them now matter what you try ..in fact I made them worse...but I still like them as a lightweight comfortable easy to put on boot..If I bought another pair I might try a different color so the dirt didn't show up so easily..also no insulation in them so they are not a winter boot...", "These are so comfortable right out of the box! love em.", "I got bigger size but a bit uncomfortable in the toes", "Just tried these on and so far so good. I have a very sensitive left foot (surgery related) and it is very hard for me to find shoes that don't hurt, let alone boots. We will see how they feel after a long ride on the bike. Updates to come. I am hopeful these will do the job well.", "I use this product everyday for work. The are garbage dont waste you time and money. The inside liner is falling apart the adhesive holding the soles on are failing as well as the stitching. They are mot waterproof. I personally will not waste my money again haven't enen used more than 90 days.", "Good boot, fit nice easy to put on and off.", "Zipper never worked on one boot but but because the boot fits correctly the Velcro holds it all together.", "Excellent BDU Boot, Will re review in a month as I will be rough on these, I also coated all areas with hard core repellent for water and snow, I do this to all my boots and shoes even if says water proof. Fit perfect as soon as I put on. So far better as Bates or 5.11. And price is half the cost. Will most likely purchase another pair soon for back up.", "Just got them used once so far over rough terrain with no problem, my feet where fine, beak in not needed, kept water out from damp grass, griped well on wet rocks, cleaned up with ease.. Mud did stick on the bottom of the boots but it came out quickly with a good kick.", "Bought these for my son for civil air patrol and missed the window to return... They make him look like he has clown feet due to being so wide. His squad commander told him to get new ones, that they looked sloppy...", "Quality as expected. No wearing out issues. Not a top of the line product, chafe through my wool socks on long shifts sometimes but for the price they're perfectly satisfactory. If you want quality for this sort of product I suggest spending $80+", "I ordered a size 11 and they are more like a 10 very wide. Hard to keep my foot from hitting the end of the toe box because of how wide they are. Thay are NOT water repellant.", "My husband loves these and says they are very comfortable.", "Product is cheaply made. You get what you pay for. Would not have purchased of seen.", "They fit so well, I just order a second pair...love these boots..", "Seems like a good boot. Fits right and appears to be good quality. Have only worn two days but so far so good.", "100% Happy with the quality of this boot. Lighter and more flexible than other motorcycle riding boots.", "Very comfortable but the sole is coming apart just open them haven't even more than yet and going to send them back", "Quality boots for a good price. Run a little wide but comfortable. They don't have much arch support but they are large enough to add an orthotic insert. Overall very satisfied.", "These boots are ok at best. For a small frame or light guy these could be the best thing on earth. I'm six.. one.. two.. fifty.. and these boots couldn't hold up. The foot cut is more Nike style and my heel is just to much for that. Converse had a sweet zip up boot and I have had four pairs since there start. But no more and I guess the quest shall continue for its replacement.", "OK quality for the price, just too small. Order 1/2 size larger or more.", "I can say that I am shocked with these boots for this price, I can say I have put them through the test and they are holding up great, only issue I have that is negative is that they are slick on wet floors.", "They are exactly what I was hoping for. They are tremendously comfortable. It makes staying for 8 hours at a time no big deal. The only complaint I have is that they aren't slip resistant as they claim to be. I work around a lot of oily surfaces and that is one of the main reasons for unchanging these shoes but they don't help at all. I slid around more than with my sketchers. With that being said, I'm still highly satisfied with them and am happy with my purchase.", "Boots seem well made, and look good. Had to return because the only way I could get them on was to completely unlace them. Guess I need a larger size.", "Fits and looks good.

It's much tighter than my usual boots fits like an 8 1/2.", "Wow, bought based on all the good reviews . In law-enforcement So I figured I\u2019d give them a try. What a mistake ,worst boots I ever wore and complete garbage. Much too wide and very uncomfortable, better boots at Walmart. \ud83d\udc4e", "These boots are very comfortable. This is the first pair I've ever purchased and I really like them. I've worn Bates and Magnum boots in the past and they don't come close to the comfort in these. The laces are rather thin but other than that theres not a bad thing I can say about them. I recommend you try them and see for yourself!", "We ordered two pairs of these boots, and each pair broke within two months of wear on an 11 year old boy. The first pair's eyelets ripped. The second pair's toe ripped out and separated from the sole. I would not recommend these for an active boy. Get something stronger or plan on replacing them often.", "Fit very well and are very comfortable helps husbands back", "These shoes are outstanding! They fit snug first week until you break them in. Weight isn't heavy.

Quality seems very poor though. After only 5 months, the stitching is coming apart and the eyelets are pulling up and tearing. Gonna complain to the manufacturer and see if they\u2019ll stand behind their product.

The boots are ok for the price.", "these boots rock! will for sure order another pair when the time comes", "Good quality comfortable boots! I love the fact you only have to lace 1x new and 1x after they settle in after that the zipper is easy on and off very comfortable for riding a motorcycle good ankle protection", "Great looks, and very comfortable right out of the box. I've worn combat boots similar to these professionally for the last 30+ years, so I guess I'd know. They don't readily take a traditional spit-shine, so if that matters, get the gloss kit from Galls. The only issue is that one heel feels a little off, like maybe my foot isn't coming down squarely in the center of it.", "Amazing comfort. Easy on/off with side zipper. very warm and comfortable. However, these are the noisiest shoes I've ever worn. They squeak incessantly , almost to the point of being clown shoes. EVERY STEP ..Both feet, squeak squeak squeak!!!!

Including snow.", "My son picked these out and we both were a bit nervous about the sizing as he ordered a 14 med. However, when they arrived 4 days ahead of schedule...yay! We were both very pleased, because not only did they look good, they fit perfectly! Now to see how long they hold up.

And sole has separated from leather sides fairly quick.", "This is a $50 boot and is the quality of what I'd expect (or better) for a $50 boot. The fit is true to size for me, with a medium weight wool boot sock. The zipper works well. I cut that little tab on the back of the boot off because my pants get hung up on it. I have no idea with that tab is for but it's super annoying. Very good value for $50.", "I ordered them to my normal shoe size, when they arrived they were way to small. Sent them back and ordered 2 sizes larger and they fit good now. After 4 months of wearing them the outside is already starting to peel off. I am a Correctional Officer and on my feet all day. They are not holding up to normal wear and tear. I do not recommend these boots and will not buy them again!!", "My favorite boots Lightweight, zipper action, everything about this boot is great!", "Got boots on aug23. It is now Oct 3td.

Now I have to go to shoe maker and have them repaired.i hate wasting money.", "These have become daily wearers for my husband. He loves them.", "I am a refinery oil worker, these boots fit excellent and are extemely comfortable. The boots literally feel like I'm walking on soft rubber. I cannot stress how comfy they are and very well made. The pic is a 3 year old pair with literally 100s of miles walked and thousands of metal stairs climbed. I used these boots hiking and climbing.", "I've been using these boots heavily outdoors every day for work, and I love them. They hold up great and the zipper is so nice to have. Only down side is that after a long while the paint starts chipping off, but that's expected with heavy use I guess. UPDATE: now a 3 star because I use them the same as my other boots, but there's no ventilation to help foot smell. They just smell every time I use them now.", "Came like a whole size too big and the material is pretty crappy if I do say so myself the toes of my boots after just a month and a half have faded away", "Originally bought for outdoor use on the job. I'm in mud/clay and rain all day/every day. The sole of each boot is splitting off of shoe. Had this pair less than 4 months. Don't bother. Spend a little more for something that will hold up longer.", "Honestly, I love this boot. Its comfortable and perfect for my job. My 1 complaint is that I have had this boot for 1 month and unfortunately the inside heel is already falling apart. Very upsetting considering before these, I wore $25 boots from an outlet store for 8 months straight and the inside heel never once fell apart like this. Don't know if I just maybe got a bad boot, but I'm disappointed in the durability of this boot.", "Great boots for the price, had a couple of the treads come out of the front rubber part of the boot on day one. This being said they have held up for 2 weeks so far with an average of 6 1/2 miles of walking.

I also water treat them.", "absolutely the best books I have ever worn worth every single penny and I would gladly buy them a second time delivered on time fit and finish absolutely flawless you will not be able to find a more comfortable pair of boots not really made for walking but if you do a lot of standing and steady movement throughout the day these will be perfect", "Have only had them for a few days. They're serviceable and somewhat comfortable, but look cheaply made when you look closely. At approximately 10 hours into a 12 hour shift, my pair start to become a little uncomfortable though. Where leather and sole meet on the inside front of the right boot, there is a bow. It appears almost as if something is trying to push it's way out. I've had worse, but have definitely had better. Probably would not purchase again.", "I just now got time to really put on my boots. Yeah man the right one is great, got the left one out, man whats wrong with this. Oh no, it's the wrong size. You guys sent me one the right size, 11,, the other a 12. How smart of work is that ? I need an 11 m .", "Very dis-pleased. Product does not hold up. Do minimal walking with these boots and they are falling apart already. Bought cheaper boots from walmart that lasted 10 times longer. Boots are literally falling apart Very unhappy", "This was way too tight around the ankle for the person I bought it for, but the length was okay. That isn't normally an issue with other boots.

Snug fitting. The inserts however are garbage. They came apart after barely 1 week of wearing them. I work in a warehouse, a good amount of walking and no extreme conditions. Will alter this review if I can get the company to replace the inserts.", "I love the boots! There is not a thing to complain about with these. Below are some things I about them. - They fit perfectly - They have the leather on the front where the toes are for when you're rappelling. - They are very comfortable, I am a Type 1 Diabetic so some shoes I have to watch out for, but the soles in these are great. - They keep your feet warm, but not too warm, which is especially good for this up coming winter! - They're good for any terrain - They have good grip", "This was a very comfortable shoe. I appreciate it. It fits as promised. Designed exactly like the picture.", "Extremely tight (even ordered a half size larger and a 2E width). Very cheap feeling and looking. The second I put them on I felt as if they would rip apart in a few weeks.", "The shoe is nice looking, however it does fit very narrow and tends to rub around your shine which can be uncomfortable. The shoe doesn't hold up very well, it scuff and the stitching comes loose from basic daily wear. I would not recommend.", "See the squeaky clown shoes video. It is not mine, but was my experience with these boots too. Kind of embarassing. So much for tactical stealth. Had high hopes for these as they were the most comfortable I've ever tried.", "Bought these for my husband to replace his work shoes we typically buy at a Police Warehouse nearby. These were $50 cheaper!! After the first night (breaking them in) was a little rough in them, he loves them! Lighter than his past boots and they fit well. We'll be back when these wear out!", "I love these boots, especially the zipper along the side, it makes them easy to remove and put on. The fit is perfect, I was worried about buying work boots online, without trying them on. But, no problem, the fit is great! The boots appear to be very well made. I've had a lot of combat boots or police work boots over my career, these boots are great.", "Fit is good, very comfortable. Lots of cushion in the sole, feels more like a pair of sneakers than boots. Construction appears to be on par with most other brands that cost double what these boots do. The Zippers were a major concern but are excellent with triple stitching and very solid lock up. Good traction on wet slippery concrete, with no squeaking. A great value, on a good pair of light duty boots.", "Bought these in a wide in my normal size. They were a little tight. So, ordered a half size larger. They fit great! Going to order a second pair for when these wear out.", "Look good, feel good. Had to replace the strings with 550 cord but otherwise happy overall", "I love these boots! Great for yard work. The stiches In front toe got a little loose. I just use a needle nose plier inside and pulled the stitches tight.

Perfect...", "You get what you pay for, right. Price of these boots is very low and so is the quality. Ordered them a half size larger than usual, and the fit was pretty good.

I've had these boots for 4 months and haven't done a whole lot of walking but the laces already busted both on the same day.

Seams on the fabric parts were already coming apart", "I wear a size 9 and these boots fit perfectly and are super comfortable, I could wear these all day", "My husband LOVES these shoes! What a perfect gift they were. They do run a bit small so I\u2019d suggest to go up a size.", "These boots like nice but they are not good quality!

They are super comfortable and love the zipper which makes taking off and on very easy. These are well made and a great price. My son who is in the army said they are very good quality. Definitely recommend!!", "These boots are comparable to boots that are much more expensive....last a long time and are comfortable", "I bought these to wear on a motorcycle in Texas. The fit is great in my normal size. They are very warm on warm days with my feet near the hot engine. Workmanship and material are very good so far after three weeks.", "My son wor this 5 times and it is falling apart", "Very comfortable and easy to put on. Pretty true to size.", "My husband wore these to work for two weeks and they were already trashed. He is a truck driver and boots just don't seem to last him very long. The soles were blown out and falling apart in no time. Maybe the quality just wasn't made for his type of job.", "Edit: These looked great at first, but the stitching began to break and come undone in less than a month. The end result was very disappointing. I bought these because of the great reviews. They didn't disappoint! These are work boots for my son and so far they are performing perfectly.", "Great fit and comfortable out is the box. The boots seem to hold up well in all environments.", "I hate that it didn't have the shoe lace hooks at the top of the not for easy tie. Had to change the insoles they are cheap quality make feet smell.", "Revised, cannot recommend these boots, unlike other maelstrom boots, these are suede and while i have had them for a while they were worn rarely. The suede is entirely too thin and they simpky did not last.as you can see, rest of boot is clean and well cared for.", "I\u2019m sure with the right size and it would be great boot", "I love the steeltoe and the quality of these boots.", "This product stated that no break in needed. Well that is untrue. Still trying to break them in after 2 weeks.", "It's not often that I comment about a product. However I love these boots and appreciate how much nicer they are than I had expected. Straight out of the box they fit perfect. (Size 9.5 d) also surprising is the weight, they are light, not much heavier than dress shoes. Flexible, great arch and foot bed, and warm. Thanks, Jim", "I usually buy my boots 9.5 I wear 10.5 in sneakers. These were just a little too small I reordered a size 10. But even though they were small they felt great. I will be buying a black pair as well. I'm a upser and these are amazing. I will be back to tell you how long they last! Great product!", "Very comfortable. They run just a bit large so adjust for that. My husband wears these boots 13 hrs a day and just loves them! Lightweight but sturdy. Not slip resistant. Can be polished up nicely!", "I bought these boots in February, because of the high reviews, expecting some Winter wear time that never came around. I finally broke them out this August. They felt Ok around the house for a day. However, I wore them for 2 days in the field. And they began to pop the stitches at the toe on both boots. They also became so uncomfortable, I refuse to wear them again. Remember, 1 day around the house and 2 days working in the field. They fell apart and feel like cheap boots . Here's a picture or 2.", "Busted after a few months of use. Outer 'wall' of right boot separated from sole, leaving an odd pocket that my heel keeps slipping towards.

Not sure how they held up so well for the other reviewers, they have mainly seen use for me in offices and airports.", "I\u2019m a 9.5 in all other military boots but for some reason you guys 9.5 was almost a whole inch longer and wider. I ordered the size 9 after fits a little bit much better but not snub just a slight tightness", "This is the 3rd time I got this boot and they all have fit well and lasted min of 1 year. I will keep getting this same boots", "These boots would have received 5 stars from me except for one irritating flaw. They squeak, I'm a police officer for NASA so we make alot of rounds per 8 or 12 hr shift. They are extremely comfortable no matter the terrain; concrete, grass, asphalt, office flooring. Walking through the cubicle areas where it is quiet though, people can recognize me from a distance away. Other than that for the price, you cant beat them.", "Almost as good as the equivalent Magnum boots in looks, durability, support, and comfort but half the price. This is my second pair and the old ones lasted a year of heavy wear (Magnums would last 12-18 months). I wish that Magnum Boots would have not gone up in price so much in the past couple of years but I am glad to have discovered Maelstrom.", "These fit well except they seem a little long. The only things I am not really happy with is the fact that they are about 4 different colors and the shoe strings are cheap junk. But, at the price they are nice. Buy them, replace the string with real boot laces and get used to the colors, you'll be fine with them.", "Great boots but make sure, really make sure that you get one size larger heed what all the reviewers are saying. Or you will end up returning them for a larger size. Also if you wear them all day get a good pair of insoles, If you wear orthotics get a size and a half larger. you have been warned =)", "My only issue with these boots is that the right boot is starting to squeak when I am walking in them. Other than that these boots are awesome! They fit snugly, and with very little to no time required to break them in.

Fit is just a little snug but will be perfect after I've broken them in. Well made, extremely comfortable, lightweight. All in all an exceptional boot for the price.

They came in Monday Mar 6, 2017. He loved them and they fit perfectly!!!", "Got them wet one time and the boots came apart.", "These are a good boot , it will be my second pair desighn is a little different , I loved my first pair wish they would have stayed with first desighn. But happy great price. Not like a cheap walmart brand at all.", "Okay these run a tad big and a tad wide. With that being said I work 10 hour shifts on my feet a lot and these feel great. I like the zipper for ease too. I ordered true to my size. My New Balance ones were discontinued but I found a great replacement.", "This product is terrible I\u2019ve had it less the. Two weeks and the inside of the heel has broken. The cushion has rubbed off and I have severe blisters. I\u2019m use to breaking in shoes but these have left me with severe broken heel and a trip to the doctors", "It was advertised as comfortable but they aren't all that comfortable on the bottom of my feet however I do a lot of hiking and biking so perhaps it just isn't good enough for that. I like the side zipper, I can put them on and take them off pretty easy. Wore out after 3 months, they are just another gyp.", "Excellent boot for the money. Fit slightly tight with tube socks at first. I am 10.5 and returned for 11 Worth returning for correct size. Very comfy.", "I have had these for 3 months. I used these as a EMT/FIREFIGHTER fake leather finish came off after 2 months . Bottom of shoe came off after 3 months never buying again", "Seems like a quality product other than a little bit of a tight fit", "very comfortable boot. it runs a little small, though. so i ordered another pair a half size bigger. very durable boot. this is my third pair that i have purchased", "I love these. I wear them all day long. I went with wide ones and they fit perfect. Probably the most comfortable boots I've owned and that includes the different high priced combat boots I've had in the last 20 or so years. They feel like a pair of basketball shoes. Now to buy a pair of the summer ones :)", "The zipper is the best part, easy on and off, I bought them for hiking and fishing and I love them.", "Cheaply made boots. The tops scratched up pretty immediately. Not very comfortable for standing shifts.

At least that's what I thought. After about two weeks of wear the front stitching on one of the boots started coming apart. I am told the stitching is only cosmetic but that doesn't mean I don't want the boots to look nice. It is likely a manufacturing defect and hopefully I can get them replaced or at least refunded.", "It has been a great boot so far, I have used them for paintball and other hiking and camp outings. I will update in a while when they are broke in fully.", "No problems with the boots so far. fit was great and needed no time to break in. I like you can unzip them and remove them with ease while leaving the bott laces tied. It also fits tight when you put them on. bought some 5 11 for a 100.00 and lasted about a year, im on month 2 and they are still holding up fine. Price is right and they are comfortable.", "I'm going to go with u get what u pay for. Look nice appear durable. Tore stitching in tongue with first attempt to Don boots. Sometimes it's just worth spending the $$$ if u actually want something worth while.", "These boots were purchased as a second pair. The first pair became an all time favorite.", "I checked it from side to side ... it has a good design itself, the materials that are not even the best are fine. The seams are ok and the zipper does not have faults. The product is very good and although there are boots best quality for the price really that page are a real bargain. I recommend to buy anything .5 or 1 size larger as they get something fair.", "Delivered as promised. Size seemed normal. Comfy for my feet. Wore them all day with decent support.", "My husband had these in tan, but they had suede ans he really worn them in working outside everyday. He really likes the black boots more.", "I really like the boots. The zipper makes for easy on and off, very comfortable, yet durable, well insulated. I wear them daily since I received them and they improve with wear. I was hoping they would wear well all day, and they lived up to my expectations. Very reasonably priced for the quality. Highly recommended.", "Had these for about 2 years now and they still look like they can handle 2 more!", "One of the most comfortable boots I have ever worn. Will update when I see how long they last.", "This boot was pretty much as expected for the price, I wanted the ones with a zipper for ease of getting them on and off, it remains to be seen how well they hold up in the heat and conditions off where I am going shortly I will give an update in about 6 weeks when I return.", "Had for one week and they are already breaking down. They are very uncomfortable. I guess that's what I get for not paying for more expensive boots.

I changed the insoles to something a bit softer, but other than that they are great and easy to breakin.", "9.5 is what I wear, have many boots and shoes and all are 9.5. Had to return these and get 10.5. The 10.5 fit very well, so order one size up if you want them to fit. Great boots otherwise. First time that I have bought zippered boots but they work really well.", "I like the overall design of tactical boots, they're great for boots that go on quickly, but give a good snug fit. Only problem I had with my boots were the foot support. I'm generally on my feet all day everyday, and they were okay at first but the support deteriorated quickly.", "I tried them on, and it's a great fit. Feel comfy. Time will tell if they can stay that way.", "It feels a little cheaply made and you can obviously see the glue work. It\u2019s a gift for my father and I\u2019m embarrassed I gave it to him with how sloppy it looks. If I could go back and buy something else I would.", "This is a decent boot for the price. I don't think it would hold up for long as an everyday work boot, but I use it for yard work", "They are for my husband for work. He said they are comfortable", "Great pair of boots. Looking forward to seeing how they wear long term.", "shipping was on time. product seems to be alright. only size specification should have said should be 75% fit size. then you would know to order a size bigger", "Feels to me that these run a bit small.

But I should have ordered a size 12. The 11 1/2 was too small. Usually eleven and a half is my size I think they must run small.", "Comfortable boot and I really like the zip up side. I don't wear them everyday but they seem to be holding up pretty well and I can wear them all day without any problem.s", "Fantastic boots with a nice zipper and Velcro system on the side. No more lacing and tying, easy on and easy off. The soles are very quiet when you walk softly.", "Shoes felt like one was at least half a size smaller than the other. Soles are NOT non-slip, as they are even more slippery than my tennis shoes on wet brick tile.

They offer great support and are very comfortable \ud83d\udc4d", "Good boot, a little tight on the ankles but still good just needs breaking in before it's comfortable, definitely would buy again!!", "Lightweight, true fit, perfect duty boot/ work boot and at a price you don't feel bad wearing them to work. Great buy for a person who doesn't have 200 dollars for work shoes. The non-slip, and water proofing are up to par.", "This is my third pair. These Boots are incredibly comfortable and light weight. I am a size 15 2E, and it is difficult to find boots in my size. I work as a security guard and I'm on my feet patrolling for hours at a time, and these Boots make it bearable. I work 60-80 hour weeks on a regular basis, so these boots get some serious use. Amazing customer service and humility, something you don't find in companies frequently in this day in age. Overall, very pleased. Would recommend to anyone.", "I have been having these boots for over a year and have held up very well and comfortable great for the price", "Just started using them but so far I'm quite pleased. Fit was the same as my Red Wings and just as comfortable right from the start.", "These boots are the best pair of boots I have ever owned, very comfortable, good support. If I ever buy another pair it will definitely be Maelstroms again. Kick ass and comfort all in one boot. Respects.", "They look nice. .the front is a bit round and bulky though. My main complaint is for some reason although they fit after 1hr of having them on there hurting my feet! Not sure if I have to \"break em in\" but it sucks because before these I had some tactical converse and they lasted a yr with 5 day a week use and felt great.", "These boots are very comfortable and extremely light weight to wear. As long as you don't have any real work to do on a daily basis. We tried these for our landscaping company as the comfort and weight would have been perfect for all day wear. they lasted less than 2 months. I was very disappointed.", "all the toe box did was pinch. A shame, I really liked them otherwise.", "I work maintenance and security, so I\u2019m all over the place. In the snow out side in the cold for long times, standing and basically buy this it was worth the money and I will keep buying them have owned them for few months now no problems", "I work two jobs and I am constantly on my feet, I'm a bit overweight and have bad flat feet. I can't say how these boots hold up because I've only had them for 2 days but as soon as I started wearing them my Feet started feeling better.

Looked nice on his feet.", "I usually fit great in 11.5m but it was tight in the toe so I got the 12m. perfect fit, very comfy. don't know if all sizes are slightly snug.", "I work full time security and proper footwear is essential. The break in period for these boots was pretty terrible, my feet burned and I got some nasty blisters. I recommend only wearing these for an hour or so at a time at first and when you aren't wearing them put shoe trees in them or stuff them with newspaper/socks. Once broken in, these boots have been great. Very comfortable and the side zipper is a god send after I finish a 12 hour shift. I would recommend changing the laces immediately as they will fray and snap in a matter of months.", "Very comfortable boots! The zipper is quite useful for getting the boots on and off. The only proble, and the reason I didn't rate a 5, is that after just 4 days of backcountry hiking in NC one of the metal grommets for the laces had became rusty and cause the lace to tear in two.", "Very durable boots! after about two months of continuous wear they only show signs of fraying. I literally wear these every single day in an indoor environment which gets pretty wet quite often. They dry out quickly too. I'll most likely buy these exact same boots when they wear out again. They fit a bit tight, so if the size you try doesn't fit, try the next size up. Mine fit perfectly.", "Well made. Very comfortable. Was able to wear for 8 HR work day without discomfort. Has padded sole. Would recommend strongly.", "Great boots, Just don't step in water. For the price these boots can't be beat. Many boots are advertised as not needing a break in period and it turns out to be false. These really don't. Comfortable right of the box. Coming from the military I assumed all boots were waterproof. I'm now a contractor in Afghanistan and I didn't want boots that I had to tie every morning. Bought these and I received a rude awaking when I stepped into snowy puddle. Cold and wet socks are the worst. Great boots, but not waterproof.", "not made in America that's obvious, toe box fair but made to fit chicken legs", "One of my laces snapped I've only had these a month or two. Go ahead and buy 550 paracord laces cause these stink. I also have have some seam fraying next to the zipper on both boots. The water resistance works ok on the right but not so much on the left.", "My boots didn\u2019t last long. The only time I would wear them is on the weekends if I went somewhere I only had them a month when they started falling apart. I could maybe understand if I wore them every day. I didn\u2019t even break them in good before the boot started coming apart", "These are great! They're comfortable and have a very military/tactical look to them. I love the zipper down the side; you can just lace them up once and then use the zipper to get in and out of them.", "The insoles squeak a lot when walking and it's quite bothersome that they aren't attached to the inside (glued down) but the overall fit and comfortable feel of them are great.", "I bought these boots for my 15 year old son.

Recommended steal if you need good boots.", "They are nice looking, they are well made but I have wide feet and I bought medium width thinking they would stretch. If I were to purchase another pair I'd go a size Larger than what I take.", "These boots feel amazing, the fit is as expected, they are very well cushioned on the inside for arch, sole, and ankle support. I am a security guard and I'm on my feet, standing and walking, all day. The mesh allows them to remain flexible so I still have full range of movement without feeling restricted. They're still new so I'll update once I get a chance to see how they deal with wear. So far though, I'm very pleased. and the shipping was amazingly fast!

Awesome boot, comfortable, cool and inexpensive. Would definetly recommend this to anyone", "These are cheap and cheaply made. My first day wearing them the stiching on the front of the boot completely came out. It held together because of the glue, but the stiching is junk. Also - they don't run true to size.

I've worn them pretty much every day since I received them. So far so good. Yard work and cutting brush, generally just average homeowner duties. At the end of the day I used to look forward to taking off my boots because my feet needed a break. Not so much with these boots. Short term, so far they're fine.

They are perfect for a second pair of non daily use.", "I like these boots, they are vey comfortable for sure. I was looking for a good motorcycle boot but these were just to hot to wear.

I paid extra to have them next day and paying extra to have them picked up by UPS and all because they can label sizes correctly.", "I would give these boots a 5 \u2b50...They are the most comfortable shoes or boots I ever worn by far.

Very pleased as an overnight security with walking all night in these shoes no problem.", "These are my new woods boots. The boots fit nicely and keep the water out to above the ankle or so.

I work on a concrete floor and these keep my feet smiling.", "I've had a pair for almost a year and I have them on about 12-16 hours a day for everyday activity. They are very comfortable but are showing signs of damage to sole, cracks and small hole size of pen tip. They are still good to use, but I'm guessing their durability is similar to tennis shoes, just heavier with thicker sole.

Returned them and ordered 11.5 EE again, again the order got changed to 11 EE.", "I stand, walk, and run for almost an entire 10 hour work day. That being said I am rough on my boots.

Love these,and will probably get another pair!", "I like the boots, I've purchased several thru the years. Good price", "A nice, but not too heavy, heavy duty boot. It's hard enough to find footwear in a 15, but to find a pair at such an affordable price, and look and feel awesome as hell, is a great bonus. The side tie zipper makes getting them on and off in hurry, and the fabric siding makes these not wear out as quickly. I'll be buying another pair if I wind up destroying these from excessive use.", "The boots fits well, but due to a loud squeak in the right boot make them unusable for security work. See reviews for video. Contacted the manufacturer, but no response, which I find a terrible example of customer support and relations.

I had the reboks like these before and regret not getting them again.", "I use these boots everyday, I depend on them to get me through 10.5 hour work days. Compared to other boots I've worn, these cause little to no leg fatigue. My buddy and I both wear these boots in the field as well. Carrying gear for 8 hours across diverse terrain calls for great footwear...Maelstrom delivers. This is my second pair, and I will most likely buy another pair for backup.

He told me Thank you . several times", "These should break in quickly as they are light and pretty soft. Shoe laces are crap.

I work security and I'm doing an EMT course these boots are ideal. Im constantly patrolling and running around, they are very comfortable and durable.

I'd buy another pair in a heartbeat.", "I'm a security officer, I perform walking patrols an average of 2-3 miles per day. These boots are the 3rd type of boot I've had since starting my job and are by far my favorite.

Sizing is correct. They are warm, waterproof and stylish. The Velcro helps him to get in the boots easy. They are lined all through with cozy fake fur. But what us surprised, was the built-in ice-cleats on the bottom back of the shoe. I must say, the most genius idea ever. Living in AK and having icey roads all through the winter, this is the best feature ever. Wish they would make these for adults as well. My daughter wants the same boots now too.", "These boots are awesome! For starters they are cheaper than even walmart snow boots. My favorite feature is the metal cleat in the back. Keeps him steady on ice and I dont wory about him falling. The cleat is gental enough for my wood and tile floors too....no marks and he has hardly taken them off except to dry the past 4 months. They keep his feet warm and dry. Best boots we've ever purchased", "My son wears a 10-10.5 but I always go up a size for snow boots for extra socks or suit stuffing and got these in 11.5. He says they are comfortable and just wore them outside for the first snow of the season. They seem great soft faux fur on the inside and the ice cleats are pretty cool. For $20 I think it\u2019s a good deal. Easy to get on/off and appear high quality. Made in China.", "Love these. They are easy for my son to get on and off. Love velcro! They have and interesting feature, a little claw teeth metal thing to pull out when its icy and snowy to prevent slipping. Kinda cool. Don't think they have a picture of this feature , but it's nice. Also, the fur goes all the way inside to the toe, so it might be good to size up half a size. I would recommend this product and I didn't receive a discount for my review.", "we live at 6,700 ft in the mountains of Wyoming. our weather varies so much I needed a double duty boot for rain/snow that wasn't going to overheat or underheat my sons feet. he played in these for 2 hours in about 8 inches of snow and when he came in his socks were still dry and his feet weren't sweaty. his boots were wet on the outside but dried quickly! ours did not come with the pick attached at the bottom which is fine. I would recommend these!", "Very beautiful, warm, light! Bought my son 8 years he likes me too!!! Recommend!", "These are absolute junk. I'm shocked by all the 5 star reviews! They're paper thin, stiff-crinkly plastic outer with the thinnest layer of fur on the inside. The top portion is very wide and open, it will not keep snow out. The bottom is very narrow with a thick sole, but I cannot imagine that they'd be warm at all given the structure of the rest of the boot.", "Love the fur lining in the boots, easy to get on and off, and can't beat them for this price! We ordered two pairs, one for each of my kids. The size 12 little kids has no snow cleat. The size 3 does have the snow cleat. I'm assuming this is because little ones could get hurt. It's very sharp! It could do some damage if the stepped on another kids foot or hand while playing in the snow... but it's also great for walking on ice. Very happy with these! Fit as expected! I'm considering getting some for myself. :)", "My son is a size 2. I ordered a 2.5, and they fit PERFECT. They come in a Ziploc looking bag. I thought they'd be squashed, but they weren't. I ordered the black ones. The entire inside of the boot is lined in very soft faux fur. The tread on the bottom is great! The only thing I was disappointed with, was that they didn't have the ice picks like the other customers received... They don't include that part in the description, probably because not all colors have them. Bummer. But, on the plus side, they have some terrific tread on the bottom! Very happy with these. Would have given 5 stars if it actually had the ice picks.", "These boots are not good if you want to keep your feet from getting wet. The top area where you would secure the boot is horrible! My 9 yr old was irritated as his sock was down around his toes because of the lack of boot security around the calf. I left these with the local Goodwill when we left the Mt. Shasta area.", "My son loves these boots and insists in wearing them snow or shine. They kept his feet warm for our ski trip but when he wore them in the rain back home, the inside got wet. They may be waterproof for the snow but not the rain which is why I took of a star. Maybe remove waterproof from the description", "These boots work for our 2 year old grandson perfectly. He wears a size 8 and we ordered size 8.5 and they fit great. He has played out when it was 20 degrees and snowy and they kept his feet warm.

We are very happy with our purchase.", "These fit my son perfectly. He loved them. They look really good. I was impressed with how durable they were. And the inside is very soft. They are great for keeping my sons feet warm through the winter. He said they were very comfortable.

Would definitely reccomend them to anyone looking for decent snow boots for their child. Well worth the purchase.", "Loooove this boots. My son used these last year in bitter chicago cold. The only issue is the velcro stickers are way to sticky which is a good thing for grown ups but for kids it might be harder at times since if they dont stick the side flap correctly things around them like winter hat and scarf tends to stick on the shoes and u will see ur kid dragging his wardrobe on his shoe hehehe. I m returning this unfortunalty because of this issue. I highly recommend it.", "My son has worn these for 4-5 months of winter so far and never complains about cold feet. If he steps in a deep puddle they do leak a little, but that\u2019s not usually an issue in our cold climate. They\u2019ve lasted a solid winter, so for the price, I\u2019m pleased. We live in a very snowy place, but temps are usually in the teens and twenties, so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re insulated enough for colder climates.", "These boots fit my 4 1/2 year old son perfectly. He loves wearing them. Easy to slip on, super comfy and very warm. I love that the insulation goes from the top of the inside of the boot to the toes. We live in Idaho and it gets into the -20 degree weather some days but he hasn\u2019t complained about cold feet. I was sad some of the reviews showed some cleats on the bottom but the one we bought didn\u2019t have it, I guess that\u2019s a feature from the past cuz the reviews were older that mentioned that feature. Over all when he grows out of these boots I\u2019ll order another pair without question.", "Received these without the built in ice clear. Has anyone else received them this way?

I decided to keep them as he should be able to wear them next winter. If you order these maybe order down 1 or 1 1/2 size smaller than what you normally get?", "Wow! I am totally surprised at how great these boots were. I was happy to find my 5yo son something that wasn\u2019t stiff like a duck boot. This boot feels more like a sneaker but has the added protection of the claw on the bottom to help while walking in ice, as well as the added comfort and warmth of the fleece inside. They fit as expected. I am going to buy these every year now!", "I bought these shoes for my son. He grew out of his old shoes from last year and since this was a great price, I thought that I would try these. Although we have not used them in snow, I think that they will be okay. I like the soft lining inside the shoe and like how easy they are to put on and take off. I even considered getting myself a pair! My son was happy with the color and the overall appearance of the shoe.", "Super warm boots. My son overheats in these boots if he wears them inside. He can play in knee high snow in these boots and come inside with sweaty feet! *You should buy a size up bc the inside is so fuzzy, it makes for a snug fit, especially if you wear wool blend socks. My son wears a 6, but the 7 with socks is just right.", "We are still waiting on snow here in southeastern Michigan so I can't contest to how the boots perform in the snow but on cold days playing outside our grandson never complained of his feet being wet or cold. So far boots are holding up well. The boots stay on his feet and probably best of all they are quick and simple to put on and take off..", "These boots seem nice, but my son was slipping all over the snow (no traction), also when I went to take them off, there was a lot snow bunched up where the boot closes. His feet were warm and dry, but I think if we were out in the snow a little longer his feet would have started to get wet. I would look elsewhere.", "My son wears orthopedic braces on his feet which makes buying shoes a challenge. I'm pleased to say that these boot more than met & surpassed my expectations. Not only do his braces fit perfectly in them, it's also amazingly easy to get them on/off him. Will definitely be buying these for him yearly", "My son immediately put these boots on and wouldn't take them off for nearly 3 days straight whenever we were going out somewhere. He absolutely loves the fit and comfort. With the cold winters, he can wear them when he's going out in the snow or if it's just a normal cold day. They're very easy to put on and off by himself which saves time when trying to get out the door.", "My son is 4 years old and wears a size 10 or 10.5 in every shoe brand. I purchased him these boots in size 11 and he couldn\u2019t even put his foot completely down without it squishing up his toes into a ball. The part that goes around the leg was massive and uncomfortable, and the actual size of the shoe was significantly smaller than advertised.", "These boots fit my 8yo son well and he said they are warm. The Velcro is super strong so he will probably end up wearing them loose so he can slip them on. I think younger kids would have a hard time with the closure. The soles are really sturdy BUT they do not have the ice grip like others mentioned. I wondered if schools would let kids wear them like that but my son was disappointed.", "I like the colors. My son likes the warmth although we haven't had a huge snow yet to fully test them out. I thought they would be a bit bigger as I ordered 2 sizes bigger than what he wears but he only has about 1/2 inch of room and I thought there'd be more. So far, they are good and he doesn't need extra thick socks. He loves wearing them.", "I am extremely disappointed! These boots are not even worth $20. The boots arrived in a bag- not a shoe box, the boots inside the bag are smooshed and bent up and the now creased fabric is starting to split. This is not the greatest picture, I will try to add more.", "Very impressed with these boots that I bought my one year old. They are soft all the way down to the toes. They looked a little big when they first arrived but got perfectly, he wears a 6-7 in toddler shoes.", "My toddler loves the camo design. They seem warm without being too heavy and are easy to get on. The velcro is very secure so it seems it will keep the moisture out. True test will be snow play! Will update if they don't work well. Otherwise we seem happy with them! I wish they made them in a smaller size for my littlest.", "I brought because in review I saw build-in ice-cleats. But looks like they removed it in 2019. Over all it\u2019s good but not as I expected", "I ordered the correct size but could mint be d my kids foot to get it in the booth without him screaming. Bought another brand that works.", "Very nice and warm. Seem good quality. Haven\u2019t worn out in the snow yet to see how they hold up in the snow. Ordered a 9.5 for my 5 yr old. They seem a little narrow so if your child have wide feet, may not work or passably order a size up?", "Just received these today. Really like them. My son says they are comfy. He wears size one in shoe, but went with the 2.5. Little big but not much just how I like them. Only down side is that they did not come with the snow cleats like everyone\u2019s else\u2019s did. We got the blue pair. Really wish they did since MT gets lots of snow and ice bad. Otherwise a great snowboot! Giving 4 star for no ice cleats and haven\u2019t been tested in the snow yet. \ud83d\ude01", "These boots rock!! What great quality for the price!!! I have gone to stores and got poor quality for a steeper price! My kids love them, they are super soft and warm inside. Only issue is they run a little small so order one size up at least", "The size fits in length, and the the boots feel comfy but apparently they are tight on the sides.my son has normal feet and is very slim overall. i will probably give them to my younger son, who has a smaller shoe size.", "Easy to get on and off. Stylish. But I didn't realize they came with ice-cleats on the bottom. This makes it a horrible cold weather boot as you are hearing the metal cleat hit the floor with every step; like taps for tap dancing shoes - its that loud. If you have many days where there would be ice on the ground, then maybe this boot is for you. If you are looking for a cold weather boot that you could wear when it snows, look elsewhere.", "Got these for my son for Christmas to take back East to visit my mom in North Carolina. He ended up not needing them out there but we had a nice almost week long rain here in So Cal (surprise for us since we hardly ever get that much rain at once!) and he wore these to school. The furry inside kept his feet nice and warm and they kept his feet/socks dry too! They def get the job done!", "I got this for my 5 year old. He loves them and says his feet stay warm in freezing Boston winter. He likes to wear them at every opportunity...read 25F or below. Good product and value for money. Will buy again next year.", "Very durable, fur on the inside and super cute. Only downside was the color it looks white in the photo but it\u2019s a cream color. I\u2019m going to keep them because that doesn\u2019t bother me much. Just wasn\u2019t the color I expected. I got a 7 for my 23 month old twins. Spent a lot of time looking at reviews for the perfect reviews and these were the best I found. So hopefully this helps when buying your boots.", "We bought these for my son who was going on a fishing trip below freezing. Living in a mild climate, I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot. He said his feet were warm and comfortable the whole time. He says they\u2019re awesome and he never put on his normal shoes the entire trip! Great find!", "Perfect and warm! Love these! A bit clunky, and I did have to trim the Velcro at the top because it pokes through to my kids legs which would hurt. I just use mail clippers to get out really well. These are very nice otherwise.", "These boots came flattened in the box they were shipped in. The cardboard that was inserted in the boots did not help keep their shape. These boots are not water proof....only water resistant. Meaning, if your child does not put his/her snow pants over the boots, their feet will get wet. The boots fit as expected by the size chart and lasted the winter! \ud83d\ude01", "Initially were very nice but after only a couple of months the bottom is coming off and my sons feet were drenched every time he wore them not worth the money spent ....", "NOT SNOW BOOTS!!! 30min IN THE SNOW AND MY SONS FEET WHERE COLD, (WEARING SNOW GEAR) TOOK THEM OFF AND WHERE ALL WET... AGAIN NOT SNOW BOOTS JUST ANOTHER FASHION WANNABE SNOW BOOT...", "My little guy loves these so much that he wears them in every weather condition. He seems to be able to run and jump and play in these as if he was wearing sneakers. I really like how the inside is lined with a soft furry material. Overall a very nice product for the price.", "I live in Michigan, and we get a lot of snow.... my sons feet were so wet the first time he wore them to school his feet were a wrinkly soggy mess. Would never buy again. I\u2019m purchasing some totes ASAP in his size!", "My son loves anything cozy and by his expert-4-year-old-opinion these are the best. If you have a child who loves cozy things then these will be winning pair of boots.", "Easy to put on and well made. This is actually the second pair I\u2019ve bought. Bought them last year and my child outgrew them. Loved them so much, I ordered the same sones, just the next size up this year.", "These boots are warm and comfortable, the only reason they get any stars. They are NOT waterproof by any means! Not what we expected on a snow trip.", "The product was great but the top of the boot is so wide open that snow will get inside. I bought a 5 for a foot size that is a 4 and they were a good fit. If the top was not so wide open I would have thought these were a keeper.", "Fuzzy warm food for small feat my son explains they are comfortable and he wants to wear them every day could not ask for a better boot feet stay dry and warm", "These were great. Fit true to size for both my boys and they complained that their feet were hot/sweaty. So definitely kept them warm in the snow.", "Ordered for my son for the upcoming winter. Easy for him to put on and take off. He has worn them quite a bit and has never complained about cold feet. Haven\u2019t used them too much in snow yet but we will see.", "My son loves these boots. Only thing we would change is the ice gripper on the bottom. We RARELY flip it out to use it on the ice but even with it tucked into the boot it makes a clicking noise with each step he takes on hard floors (like in school). Oh well. Not a huge issue.", "Very comfortable, but too large. Think they sent the wrong size or they're just not true to fit", "My 4 year old tested these boots out today in about a foot of snow. Kept his feet dry and he didnt complain about his feet being cold like he did with other boots. Super easy to put a kid.", "I ordered a size 10 and they were so narrow and my toddler could not get his foot in there. I recommend going up a size or two larger. Boot was nice but we couldn't use since they were so small. They almost fit like a girls narrow 10.", "We use them everyday and we live in Las Vegas. He wears them to ride his motorcycle and to watch his brothers swim outdoors every night.", "My kid wears them, they\u2019re waterproof and warm. Is there anything else??!! Figured it was a crap shoot buying boots online. At four, kid can put them on and off by self. They\u2019re soft inside. Mom\u2019s dream!", "These boots are true to size in length but are very narrow. They look very warm but I doubt they're waterproof. I'll be returning them.", "Boots were a lil bigger than expected but did the job. Snow/ rain boots for my 7 year old and he loved how easy to put on it is.", "These boots are true to size, and warm, but they\u2019re kind of short and wide. There is a lot of room on the shins in between the boot, and the legs, so snow can get it easily. You can\u2019t adjust them to be tight enough.", "These were fantastic quality. I love how soft and snug the inside is, keeping her feet dry and warm. The velcro made them super easy to get off and on. Our favorite snow boots!", "Great for snow!!!! My child enjoy them So much on his trip to New York, price is good and good quality boots.", "My son loves these and is always excited to put them on, they have kept his feet dry and warm in our heavy snow winters here in SD. Would definitely buy again and recommend to friends. Lots of compliments on these.", "Soft inside and warm. My 7 year old wants to wear them all the time even if there is no snow. Easy to put on and take off.", "Order up a size runs short in the length from toe to heel. Otherwise nice boots.", "Bought two sets for my boys & both fit perfect. Because I read other reviews & all said order half to a full size larger than their feet are. They were correct! They are of good quality, near as we can tell, no snow yet.", "My toddler was able to put shoes on and off with ease and loves it. It is very warm inside the shoes.", "Good price shoddy quality. But two pairs of these boots one was good but the other one fell apart as soon as I used it. The velcro on the boot that's used to fasten peeled right off the boot after first Contact not impressed", "I bought the boots for my toddler grandson and my daughter says they are not only adorable but fit him well! She loves them, he likes wearing them (and playing with them) so everyone is happy! Good price for the product.", "Great winter shoes. My son loves them. If you are looking for cold weather snow boots this is a great find. Good price too. Fits true to the size. My son has a wide foot so this was lucky,- good shoes.", "My 9 year old son loves these boots. He wants to wear them even when it\u2019s not snowing because he loves how comfortable they are. He wears a 4.5 and they fit great!", "These boots are excellent! The Velcro makes it very easy to slip on a squirmy toddler. The inside is lined with faux fur which is so cozy and warm! The boots have sneaker like bottoms which makes for excellent traction. Look no further and get these boots! Can\u2019t beat the price!", "These boots are the best! This is the second pair we got my son. They are warm, sturdy, and grip well on ice! Also they are ready to get on!", "My kid wears a 13.5 I ordered a size 1 and it is to small. I will be ordering a bigger size", "There\u2019s really no way to tighten the boot around the ankle. Those buckles are just for looks, they don\u2019t actually tighten. These boots are super cute, but unfortunately they\u2019re going back today.", "My son wears them to school almost every day in the winter, they\u2019ve held up well and he can get them on and off himself.", "They were the cutest little boots on my granddaughter! Her three brothers each got new boots and so did she! She is a busy toddler keeping up with her older brothers!", "Perfect!! Warm and nice quality! They keep his feet warm and dry in the snow and rain! Great looking too so I would definitely buy again and I would recommend!!", "Great shoes, at the bottom has metal things to pull out so the child doesn\u2019t fall on ice or snow. Overall good quality, water proof. Very easy to clean/wash. Nice colors and priced reasonably. Has a warm fur inside. My kids and I loved these shoes.", "He says his feet are really warm in snow. He walks about 1/4 of a mile to and from school.", "They are so perfect. I love them, my son love them, they are cozy and comfortable.", "Ski trip and kids are growing so had to get a new pair. They love it very comfortable and warm. Great price.", "That are warren ave good quality. They have been rubbing just a little in my . But in told him to tuck his pants in and they have been good since.", "Bought for my 12 year old son. They fit as expected. Super warm and soft inside.", "These are extremely nice boots and there is a feature that my great nephew found immediately on the bottom of the boot - a little switch that brings out an ice \"thingy\" that makes them an ice snow boot. Really different. He really liked that. I initially bought the wrong size and that was my error. I ordered the right size and it fit perfectly.", "I recommend buying one size bigger. Very snug, warm, waterproof. Missing the metal piece for ice/snow. Very cute and perfect for Colorado.", "Warm and cozy boots! Son loves them. I sized up one from what he wears.", "Grear snow boot for kids. They are not only durable, but provide excellent protection from the snow. My son loves wearing these which is a plus!", "Bought these for my grandson and he went out and played in the snow for about an hour. Came back in and had to strip his socks off his feet were very warm", "These \"winter\" boots are useless, water attracting sponges. Worthless in snow.", "The shoes fit as expected and are very soft on the inside. They hold up to the snow and keep my 8 year old son's feet warm. I highly recommend these boots!", "Not bad for the price and my kids grow out of them so fast they work fine", "I bought these for my grandson for the snow. My daughter loves these and they fit really nice. I recommend these boot.", "Not quite what we expected. Are NOT water proof, my daughter has to bring extra socks to school as her feet get soaked from the snow.

Will be returning.", "My almost 4 year old loves these boots! He can easily put them on himself with the side velcro. Perfect fit!", "My son is hard on apparel, but these boots are holding up really well to him! I am happy with them. He says they are really warm as well.", "the velco makes it easy to slide off and on my boy's foot walking through slush and the inside stayed fully dry best thing though is ice cleats on the bottom! This part alone makes them a must buy i kinda wish i had a pair lol", "Ordered size toddler 8 for my 3.5 year old, fit like all his other 8s. Did not have ice cleats built in as some reviews mentioned. Easy on and off.", "My son loves the fit and warmth of these boots. He liked that they had a furry lining. Good boots for the price.", "Did not come with ice cleats.. that's the reason why I purchased", "I got these for my grandson, I like how they go on very easy.", "My son loves this boots. I bought them for a trip to Colorado and they are very comfortable and warm. My son even uses them in Texas. They are very cool boots.", "My son loved the style and functionality of the boots. The retractable cleat on the bottom was a very nice addition for ice sidewalks and walkways, and well as playing in the snow. They did fit as expected. One downfall was after only a few uses, one boot did have some water leakage into the boot. My son is pretty rough on his shoes, so I can't say for certain if it was the quality, or my son! haha!", "They feel like great sturdy shoes. My son loves them so much. We will see how they do in the snow on vacation this week! But so far we are very happy with them.", "Super cute, good fit, warm, comfortable. Not waterproof.

He loves how warm they were.", "Grandson loves these boots ..this is the 3rd pair I purchased, every winter I order him another pair", "Really cute, nice fit, but zero ability to feet from getting soaked.

Feet got wet and cold immediately.", "The chikd i purchased these for was very excited to get these!", "Very warm and comfortable snow boots, my son really likes them. We bought the black/gray ones with Velcro closure and they didn\u2019t have the cleats in the heels.", "The inside is very soft and warm, more so than snow boots with removable liners.

We're very happy.", "After playing in a melted snow puddle, my sons feet were soaking wet through the boot. He had snow pants on that were able to be both tucked into the boot and over the side of the boot, so I know the issue was with the shoes. The water leaked into the side at the site of the straps.", "They are nice boots but way too big for a 2 year old", "Fit my son just fine and he said they were comfy. Only thing I was looking forward to that wasn\u2019t included was the metal cleat on the bottom like the other models.", "My little guy looks he\u2019s these boots!

These boots run about a half size small", "These boots are great. My sons feet are warm and dry. True to size. My only complaint is the Velcro closure is very strong. My almost 7 year old has trouble doing by himself.", "These boots look nice & have a warm lining, only thing is they run a bit on the small side, maybe by half a size.", "I bought these for my 5 year old. They look great, but 15 minutes in the snow and his feet were cold and wet. Very disappointed!", "The boots are nice and warm... but not good for the snow.

Light on the feet, warm,comfortable, easy for kids on the spectrum who prefer velcro.", "So, my son wears a size 4, however I bought these boots in size 5.5.

Size wise it was true to size and I ordered size 3, but the fit on the feet itself was very weird being too wide at the top.

They should not be called snow boots by any means. My 5-yr old\u2019s socks and feet were freezing after playing outside for just one hour. I wish I could return them but he\u2019s worn them outside 2x and both time the material was saturated through to the fur.

My son was really excited for these boots, however, I had to return both pairs since the inner foot liner was too short for the boot. My son's toes hang off the edge of the foot liner and bothers him - it really is quite bizarre. I was hoping after the first pair, that it was just a mistake, but the next pair came the same way.

I normally wear a 7 in Crocs.", "I was really happy with my purchase- I needed these boots for an outside event I went to and rain was in the forecast. It was super muddy/wet and these boots kept my feet dry! I read the reviews about them being smaller than expected and I bought them because of that. It\u2019s hard for me to find boots that fit my legs- these were perfect! They were not too tight and did what I needed them to do. They were also great for the price!", "These boots are great. I ordered these for myself as a guy but bought the size 11 as it\u2019d fit a men\u2019s 9. I received the bow string and they look like anybody\u2019s boots. I love how light they are and they slip on and off pretty easily. The crocs material is well known and very sturdy. If your a guy wanting croc boots you\u2019ll like these. I am going to email the company and ask them to do a men\u2019s line because why not? They\u2019re good and near,y indestructible.. I still have my originals and in years have not broken the black tabs off the sides.

Could use a bit more flexibility in the ankle but that may adjust over time ... ... Thank you!", "I ordered these for work and I will never order crocs online again. They were too small and not what I expected. When I returned them I was charged a restocking fee and also charged because the tags were off. Well guess what, the tags weren\u2019t on them when they arrived and I didn\u2019t know I was gonna be charged for trying these on. Lesson learned!", "I am a loyal Crocs wearer, and I love these boots! I wear a 7 in other Crocs shoes (and other brands) and that's what I needed with these. I wore these to my daughter's field trip. It was muddy and we went through a creek as well. A very dirty creek, but they came out just fine and didn't stain at all. Very impressed. The fit is comfortable, as well. Other moms were complaining of blisters from their boots, but I didn't have that problem. They were also cute, probably too cute to wade through a creek, but they were fun and I got compliments on them. Would definitely recommend. I bought the flame colored ones.", "I thought they might become less stiff with use, but no. Walking, and particularly trying to take the stairs with them on, is super awkward not being able to bend your foot without slipping the boots half off. This was my first experience with crocs material-- it's like a hard plastic. They're at least water proof.", "I effing love these boots. I spend most of my days hiking and during the winter it is a muddy mess. These boots keep my feet warm and dry and I can stomp through all manner of horrors along the trail no problem. Everyone I run into asks me about them. And the color is so fun! I have skinny calves so these are perfect. Most rain boots are so wide, rain just falls into them which makes them useless. Sturdy too, I\u2019ve been wearing them nearly every day for a couple of months and they\u2019re only getting more comfortable. It did take a few days to break them in.", "I took these boots with me to Ecuador, where I hiked in a swamp (paramo), the jungle (tiputini) and the Galapagos islands. They were SO comfy and light. I also used them that fall when I worked as an ostrich keeper. I mixed and poured cement in them too and it washed off real quick. They're waterproof, comfortable, and have a spring to the sole that i love. I don't like pointy boots or heavy boots so i really hit the jackpot with these. I honestly love them. They make a little crease when you start wearing them but otherwise that's it.", "So, I wear a 9.5 in 90% of brands. I don't own anything in a 10, but do have a handful of size 9's. So when this (brown color) wasn't available in a 10, I got a 9.... And am super bummed because they are just a bit too small to wear comfortably. They're so cute though! The calf opening fits perfectly, the bows are really cute and they are overall very comfortable & durable. And sooooo lightweight. Really wish I could return them and get a bigger size. But theyre amazing rain boots.", "I got compliments on the color. It looks like an original yellow rain-boot. Very light weight and difficult to get dirty! On the bottom of the foot barley gets dirty, I think it is from the material. Sometimes it makes my feet cold. The fit was perfect and i fit a 7 women.", "Virtual Exchanges is a complete rip-off. Purchased a pair of these Crocs Freesail rain boots. Returned them due to not fitting properly around the calf. The return amount was deducted by over 60% just for trying them on because they consider that \u201c worn once \u201c. Who doesn\u2019t try something on when they purchase? Will definitely never purchase from Virtual Exchanges again and strongly urge anyone else does the same!", "These are simple and look fine, my feet don\u2019t hurt from wearing them. They seem to be functional but after a couple of months I\u2019ve noticed that they are really stiff to walk in. They\u2019re also a little difficult to drive in because the plastic-y material doesn\u2019t have much give. They\u2019re getting visible creases at the top of the foot where you bend your ankles to walk. Overall, okay value for the money because they\u2019re relatively inexpensive, but I would recommend a more traditional rubbery rain boot with a little more give.", "For my outdoor rainy day adventures, these boots are great. I added shoe inserts which made them a tad tighter but they mold to my feet. I wear a size 7 shoe and ordered a size 7 here. If I wanted a bit more wiggle room, the next size up would have worked too. The best thing about these boots is that they are latex free and I am allergic to latex. I have no reactions in these rain boots and stay dry.", "I bought these boots for my Coraline costume for Halloween. I followed everyone's suggestion and ordered a size down. It was a perfect fit! They are comfortable and I had no issues with the calf fit, however, I am a petite person. They do get scuffed easily. I'm not sure how in one night they received scuffs all over.. but I'm sure I can wipe them off quickly.", "LOVE THESE BOOTS!!! I work outdoors, needed something sturdy, comfortable, but cute, of course, these rain boots fit all 3 requirements. They do take some breaking in, like any shoes, but after that they're great, I got a lot of compliments. I would definitely recommend these, and buy them again, absolutely love the price, color, style, and comfort all while keeping my feet dry.", "The shaft of the boot is totally rigid, so bending your ankle if very difficult. It's a shame, because it is a super cute boot!", "I really like these rainboots! I\u2019ve worn them this week and I have had zero issues with water getting in. My issue is that it is hard to walk up or down stairs in them as they do not bend like traditional rain boots do since it is made from croc\u2019s material. Another issue is the sole is not comfortable. After a while walking, feet felt sore despite the comfort sole inside. Overall, it\u2019s a great product!", "I always admired crocs on others until I purchased these boots. Although they are for gardening they are uncomfortable. This material is not soft nor flexible and it hurts my instep. I am hoping it will give after using for a while. For the price I guess you get what you pay for. I will keep it but never again.", "These are Crocs and since I've owned Crocs I had a good idea how these would fit and wear. I do a lot of hiking in the woods and certain times of the year the mud is miserable. I wore these on my last hike since we've had so much rain and they were very comfortable. I have really good hiking boots but wanted to wear something higher that I can walk through some major puddles in - and these were perfect. I have no complaints but for my own purposes I wish they were a little better suited for cold weather.", "I bought these at the same time I bought a pair of black mules. Sadly the width and comfort I've experienced with other Crocs hasn't happened. They're ok - but I don't think that they'll hold up given the amount of walking I do outside. Noting the size differences in terms of width would really help!", "These are a little stiff but serve it\u2019s purpose. I bought them for dog poop duty in the winter. They do the job, have great traction and with crocs you can expect them to last for ever. I also like that they have plenty of room in the calf.", "I ordered these for a specific event I was working in the rain and they held up great. They fit well enough that I could actually drive in them, they fit with socks and my wider calf. They did not leak and my feet were actually pretty warm. And the price on these was fantastic. Very please with this purchase.", "These boots does block out water or rain but it is so stiff. Its hard to walk in! It is also a hazard to drive with bc it does not push the brake or gas pedals well. ZERO stars", "My daughter needed a black pair of rubber boots for a college, but of course it is hard to find cute black rubber boots. We found these and she loves them. They also do not hurt her feet like the other rubber boots.", "Please read the reviews before you purchace this product. All in all it seemed like a nice study shoe. However, once on and you try to walk the rubber is so thick that it doesn't really bend. Ye feet hurt so so bad after these. I did send them back in for a refund. The tie at the top is also just fir looks it doesnt tighten or loosen anything.", "Love the color. The fit is great. The bow adds a cute detail. I do not like the 'popping' of the calf portion against my leg when I walk. The top of the boots, at the calf, are fairly wide in comparison to my other rain boots and they smack my leg when I walk and it makes a popping noise. I'm hoping a different material pan will help or maybe some wearing them with wear them in. Otherwise, they seem to be great.", "These are like trying to wear metal stovepipes, the plastic material does not bend or yield in any way. I was shocked and disappointed, as my last Croc rain boots (the knee high ones) were very comfortable, bendable plastic.", "I was excited whenever these boots were delivered to me. I have been looking for a good rain boot for years and these rain boots by Croc have ended my search. These boots fit perfectly, though it is a little awkward to walk in them at first. The awkwardness of walking in them goes away after you become accustomed to the boots. These boots fit perfectly and I love them!", "Very nice. I had a pair of Crocs rain boots that lasted much longer than more expensive rain boots and I wanted to replace them with another pair of Crocs. These are a different style than my previous pair but fit just as well and I'm hoping they last just as long. These are a cuter style and color.", "Have had these before and was happy to find on Amazon and they fit as expected. I ordered a size up from what I normally wear.", "I got my true size and they fit great. I ordered these because the reviews mentioned they were tighter around the calves. I have pretty small calves and there is still a few extra inches, but they are better than most boots that I have tried. They don't leak and are perfect for what I needed them for....And cute too!", "Loved the boots but they were to tight on my calves. My calves are not huge but obviously they are larger than what crocs thinks they should be. they are light weight and not to clunky. unfortunately i had to return them.", "Webpage advice was since these don't run in 1/2 size, then go down a size. I wear 5 1/2, so chose size 5. It was too small. I could get the boots on - tight fit; but had to get help to take them off!!! Very disappointed; but size 6 should work. Now I will find the process for exchange. . .", "Love these, wore them 3 days in a row on vacation in March in Portland Oregon. I have a high instep and was worried that they would hurt but they did not at all. They are tall enough to offer great protection but not so high that they cut into the back of my knees while sitting!", "I like the rain boot, it keeps your feet dry but I don't like the sound it make when I walk. The upper part of the boot makes a LOUD FIP FLOP noise. Everyone can hear you coming!", "These are super comfy and cute rain boots. If you are a 1/2 size I recommend going to the size below as they run a little big. I am a 7 1/2 normally and the 7 fits perfect.", "The boot was very narrow and I read the others reviews saying that it was nice and squishy and felt good I thought it needed more cushion on the heel it wasn\u2019t that comfortable I returned it", "What everyone is saying about the tops of the boots being too small for the calves are right. Although for me is wasnt a big deal. Theyre just a tad too small but doable. However if you have more muscular or just bigger calves in general, i'd recommend a different pair of boots. Theyre also not that flexable but are pretty lightweight and do seem to be of good quality. But i think if I wear them enough, theyll be just fine.", "Kind of stiff but consider the source. Perfect for mucking about in the chicken coop or muddy garden", "Great boots! Fit perfectly, completely waterproof. The best thing is that I stand for hours a day, and these never hurt my feet. Super happy with this purchase! I get SO many compliments on this cool green color!", "Too wide just wide if you have large ankles Something you might like- but I have narrow & regular size thighs, it didn't flatter me", "tight around calf with absolutly no give. These are very stiff. i sent them back", "They were very cute. I wore these 4 times and every time they got wet they shrunk. I had to donate them because they no longer fit. Do not buy.", "I bought this a 1/2 size above my size and the calf area and instep of this boot is still a bit tight. I would have liked some room in there but otherwise, they are completely lightweight and waterproof.", "So far good! Normally wear a Women\u2019s size 81/2, this was a size 9, fits perfectly with a pair of socks! Calf not a problem with an inch to spare, very comfortable!", "Perfect for what I needed (lightweight, comfortable rain boots). I don't have large calves, I'm sure it's a matter of them either totally fitting you or totally not fitting you and you just have to try them.", "Wished they came in half sizes....liking them. Went to the Oregon coast for the weekend got these boots for walking on the beach", "Just wore my new boots on a walk with my dog. My feet stayed warm & dry, but the boots rubbed & dug into my shins & ankles whenever I took a step. They are just too stiff with no flexibility. And it is not a matter of breaking them in- they will most likely stay stiff & uncomfortable because of the thick sturdy plastic they are made of. I think I will return for a neoprene style boot that hopefully will have some give to the material.", "I love them!!! So darn cute and fit with or without socks. Exactly what I wanted and clean off so nicely. Very happy!", "I like the boot, it keeps my feet dry. Although when I\u2019m walking up and down the stairs it cuts into the top of my foot.", "It looks really beautiful but tight at the heel.All my rainboot have ever had is size 9 and i dont have a problem of taking them off.This is tight at the heel i struggle to take them off,maybe should have bought a size bigger .I wore them same day i recieved them cos my previous one was leaking and due to my kind of work but turns out that one of the legs was leaking", "They fit bit you better wear socks or you need someone to help you take them off", "Really cute color. Comes up only an inch or two higher than mid calf. Strange height. Also, is stiff around the ankle, so when I walk they crease and push on my ankle. Hopefully will 'break in' and stop doing that. Cute and waterproof.", "Awesome for all weather but they do run a bit small and no half size options. They take a long time to \u201cbreak in\u201d I\u2019d give them 5 stars but they can be very difficult to get off and on.", "Love these, but they are a little tight in the calves, however I do have thick calves", "Fits pretty well.

Can't wait.", "they run a little big and they\u2019re super stiff so going up and down stairs actually hurts", "A bit of a tight fit, but that was to be expected since I'm a size 4.5 but bought a 4 since they dont stock half sizes. Other than that, the quality was as expected. Would buy again", "9 1/2, would order a size 9. Great fit, very comfortable. Very light weight!", "I love these! I bought them to wear to Alaska for when I go on an Alaskan cruise in May. I tried them on and they fit great! The only problem that I see is that they are rather stiff at first, but I am sure that will subside with regular wear.", "Got these for my wife, and she loves them. She's an 8.5 and the size 9 fits great. She says they are very comfortable and feel very soft inside despite not having a luxurious lining. Also seemed to be a good value and a brand with a good reputation.", "My husband bought these for me as a gift, thinking they were rain boots. They could be used for rainy days, but more appropriate for gardening or barn work!", "Fits tight, I wear an 8 boot. But not flexible, my calves are not big, but these fit too snug over leggings. The string is not adjustable.", "They are VERY stiff unlike the Crocs Classic Clogs. When I tried them on and walked inside of my house, they were already hurting my ankles. I don't want to wear extra socks to protect my ankles every time I wear them, so I decided to return them.", "I have narrow feet so I didn\u2019t think they were tight around my calfs at all. I own a pair of hunter boots and people always complement me when I were these instead. Super comfy!!!", "Great boots - lightweight - easy to put on and take off - the bow adds stylishness. I wear shoe size 8 or 8.5. Bought the size 8 boots - fits perfectly. Highly recommend.", "Fits really awkward. The material isn\u2019t flexible so it pinches your ankle when you bend down. I just bought these for my chicken pen because they\u2019re only one piece they\u2019re really easy to clean.", "Somehow the water gets inside of the boot, I realize that after wearing the boots my socks were wet and I checked inside the boot and it was wet.", "Light weight stiff plastic, feels like walking in ski or snowboarding boots. Hard to drive in.", "Wear these everyday, and no one can tell they're crocs. They do make a clap sound against my calves, but they're very comfortable and waterproof, so I don't mind.", "One my foot is in the boot it is not too small, but the opening by the ankle is too small and my socks get pulled super tight making my toes uncomfortable. I would recommend going up 1 size from what you wear. Rain boots are often worn when it is a little chilly in the fall or spring so you want room for warm socks since there is no soft inside lining.", "A little too big looking in general, very wide on my calves.", "Loved these rain boots! They are so light compared to others Ive had in the past, which REALLY helps with the clunkiness of wearing rain boots. They are so cute and the material is awesome.", "Foot bed part of the boots fit was fine. Calf fit was too narrow, no way to tuck the pants inside the boots, and since the shaft is rigid material it made them uncomfortable in the calf when walking. Had to return them. Too bad, they are cute.", "I'm 6.5 and order 7 since half sizes are not available, but it still manages to fit alright. These boots are light as air! I wear them to work at animal sanctuaries and they are perfect! As others have mentioned, it's a bit stiff where your foot and leg meets to bend but it got better after I broke them in a bit.

You all have to do better!", "These boots were SO STINKING CUTE! I bought them for my 16yo neice and she loved them!!!", "I absolute LOVE these boots!!!! I\u2019ve bought so many other brands and could never find the right fit, until now! Love them!", "Run small, go a size up. Very comfortable. I absolutely love them!", "Bought these for my daughter to use for playing outside in the mud. They really held their own today in the Alabama \"Snowpocalypse!\" DW", "These are good boots that will last for a while.", "My wife purchased this and she is very happy with it. She gets compliments everywhere she goes. It's very light weight and non-slip. The fit is true to size.", "It's okay. Not the most comfortable, even for short periods of time, but it serves it's purpose as a rain book.", "I have wide calves and they fit very tight. Wish the specification explained in detail how these boots were.", "Love these and the fit was perfect ! Also they r tight at the calves which is good in my case no water gets in !", "I absolutely love the way they look. I also love the fact that they are very light. I had Kamik rainboots a few years ago, but those were too stiff and heavy, I had to throw them away. As for the Crocs rainboots, I wish they were more flexible, but I guess this is how flexible rainboots can get. All in all, it was a good purchase.", "Love the boots, Purchased to work in garden. Really cute. Want another pair for rainy days.", "TOO STIFF, you can barely walk. I literally could not walk up the stairs in these boots.", "After about an hour of wearing these, they will blister your feet.", "They work great just if you wear them like me all day long look at some gel inserts they have padding just not enough to get you through a whole work shift", "I love these rain boots, a little stiff at first but they need to be worn in, really comfortable & warm, received alot of compliments on the different color :)", "these boots are very nice, but they hurt by the ankles..too much of a hassle to return, so i'm keeping them", "These are great boots.Easy to put on. I wear a 8.5-9 i got the 9 and love them. completely water resistant.

I bought another pair online and gave it back after tried crocs.", "I LOVE this rain boots! I use them for gardening and I couldn't be happier.", "So comfy and cute!! The more you wear them the comfier they get. I wear mine everyday to walk the dog and get compliments all the time :)", "These boots hold up well.

However, they are not comfortable as expected. I am a huge Croc fan but the rain boots do not compare to the other shoes. They are very flat and after hours of standing become very uncomfortable.", "So far they haven\u2019t creased in the back above the heel like all the other mud boots we have tried.", "I typically wear 7.5 and ordered these large for thick socks, but they aren't quite as roomy as I expected. They still fit fine and seem to be solid.", "these are a great shell to work with. I ordered them big so I could put in insulating layer and gel insoles.", "I usually wear 7.5 bought the 7s, they fit great", "These boots came in today and I can\u2019t wait for it to rain. They are so cute and were a really great price. The bows add something extra to them. I like how these boots aren\u2019t too wide in the calf area so I don\u2019t feel clunky. I have thin calves anyways though.", "The rain boots were perfect. They are lightweight and comfortable. Exactly what I wanted. I was not disappointed.", "They creased on my first wear and not because they were to big", "Definitely size up for this rainboot. It is very thight around my ankle. I was only able to wear them once. I wear a size 10 and that is the size I purchased.", "The boots are super cute, however, as someone with bigger calves, I had a hard time getting them to fit..I guess it just means I had to lose a few pounds!", "I liked these boots better than most. Very lightweight and I loved the cute bow on the front. I am returning them because I do not like how rigid they are. I opted for a packable option from a different brand to get what I wanted. They seemed comfortable and consistent with the cross brand. Just not my style.", "The boots are comfortable on the foot, but too tight around the calf.", "OH MY GOODNESS! I actually want it to rain so that I can wear these. I'm in northern California, so it's not too cold here. My other waterproof boots are all lined and way too warm for the weather here. These crocs, however, are perfect. They go on well, even with my thick calves. I just wear regular socks inside. These keep my feet nice and dry even in huge puddles. Oh... and I like that it's one solid piece of construction (like most crocs), so I'm not concerned about soles peeling apart or the such, especially because these boots will only be used a few times per year. Oh... and they look adorable with leggings or skinny pants.", "Love! Love! Very comfortable and easy to get off and on.", "Boots do not provide much flexibility when walking causing soreness on top of foot.", "Are use issues on my home farm with chickens goats horses dogs and they are excellent", "The boots look cute, but they are wide and a little floppy.

Had to cut them a little to make wider at the top.", "Boots started to fall apart after about two weeks of use Bottom of boots peeled off", "These are a little stiffer than I thought they'd be, but overall I really like them.", "Excellent rainboot or quick dash out to the mailbox when snowing", "It fit as expected but must say it is so hot, that most of the times my pants get wet inside the boots.", "Love these for gardening! They are bulky or somewhat \"clown like\" as some suggest, but I didn't buy them for fashion I bought them for gardening and an extreamly muddy back yard in the spring. They are cute with the tie; however it is for looks and doesn't have a purpose. They do make a weird clapping noise when I walk as others have noted. I also get very sweaty feet in these when the weather is nicer. I bought size 7 and normally wear size 7. They fit well.", "I like these boots because they're so lightweight. Based on other reviews I ordered a 6, though I'm usually a 6.5. They fit, but I would have like them a little roomier. I can't quite just step into them -- they do require a little tug. They are also a little stiff where the foot meets the ankle, but I suspect they will loosen up in time. If they don't, these boots will lose a star for comfort.", "It looks great. The only thing is that I am not too sure if they are still very new, but at the end of the day, I am in pain with my feet. New, massaging insoles might help though", "The boots are great, and the company has excellent customer service.", "I love these rain boots. Great price, fit as expected, and great color just as the picture of the product. I would recommend this product.", "This came in very handy during the rainy days in SoCal. I think you have to wear this with really sweat pants, a little loose around the calves area.", "Love the boot but my normal size was too short. My toes touched the inside toe of the boot, so I returned it for a Size fits perfect. Much easier to get in and out of the boot and is comfortable all day if I necessary, especially with a gel liner. May get another pair, slightly shorter for street ware. I should note that I have a very narrow foot and I'd say this boot, compared to others I've tried, is still comfortable, not sloppy on my feet.", "Great boots. I normally wear a 7 or 7 1/2 but decided to order an 8. They might be a tiny bit big, but I think a 7 would have been too small. Because there is no lining inside (which is great for keeping clean) I wear thick socks. They are also a bit stiff, but I could easily walk and drive in them. Comfortable with enough padding under my feet. Happy with my purchase.", "I had bought these for my work boots. I love them. They fit great and are very lite to walk in. Would definitely buy another pair", "The calf is a little tight and my calves are a muscular 14\". Like them overall though.", "I work full-time at a grooming salon so I purchased these for bathing dogs and I love them! They were a little bit stiff at first but after a few wears they became more flexible. I wear them all day and they are super comfortable and light. I would definitely recommend them.", "I really like these boots. They are light weight. They don't come up to high. They keep my feet dry.", "Love my rain boots. Just on time for the rainy season", "These are sturdy and durable, but I should have ordered down. Even with a sock my heels slip inside them. I ordered my normal size 7. I like them and got a good deal, so I will simply wear thick socks with them. But if you have narrow feet, consider sizing down.", "i LOVE these boots! they are fashionable and keep my socks dry!", "I loved everything about the boots except for the bottom of them. It was very very rigid to the point where it almost made it hard to walk. I sadly had to send them back. I normally wear an 8-1/2 shoe and I ordered a 9 and they were roomy, I would have had to wear thick socks with them.", "I have been wearing mine for approximately 5 months now. I work at a plant nursery in Washington state, so it gets very wet outside with lots of puddles and humidity. These boots keep me dry. My only qualm with them is that the little bows keep untying themselves even though I tie and double tie them over and over.", "I'm a 9-91/2 and ordered the 9s and they fit perfectly. They're a little stiff the first couple times you wear them but they loosen up and are super comfortable. The best part about them is they are so light. Some rain boots can be so heavy but these are great! They keep out the rain perfectly too", "Cute and lightweight. I keep these by the door and wear them to do outside chores.", "I was so excited about the boots, but I could not put them over my calf. So unless you are thin don't order these", "They will definitely keep my feet dry BUT they have no lining inside to keep your feet warm or keep them from overheating or sweating. I\u2019m not happy because now I have to buy boot liners. You get what you pay for", "These are comfy, as all Crocs are. The only thing I didn't like was that the front bottom part near the ankle would bend in every time I would go down the stairs and it would hurt.", "Love them! They are very lightweight - so lightweight that when I first picked up the box, I thought the box was empty. They are cute and fits true to size.", "They keep the rain out but they are VERY stiff. Hard to drive in.", "I think these boots are hideous by my 14 year old digs them. She's worn them every day since Christmas...even when it's sunny outside!", "They don't fit as expected. I have normal sized calves, and these didn't fit around them on the top. So if your calves are very thin, you will benefit from these.", "Its somewhat small. I bought a size 9. Should've got a 10. Just have to wear thin socks with it.", "I love them, they are lightweight and flexible. The have a good amount of toe room but aren't too big. Great buy", "I've worn these once so far so take it with a grain of salt, but I'm very happy with these boots. They're extremely lightweight, my former boots were rubber and very heavy. The style is cute with the bow and they're SUPER comfortable. I'd say on a calf size scale of 1-3 I'm a 2 and these are perfect. There's room for pants and to have no trouble putting them on but they're not so wide that rain will get inside. I don't need to pull them on with leggings I can step right in them if that helps illustrate. Best feature is the light weight though I wasn't expecting that.", "I got compliments all day, but my feet also felt suffocated. When I sit on the bus, my feet don't quite touch the floor, so they dangle. It worsened the suffocation of my feet and it felt as it was a noose. I quickly walked home from the bus stop and proceeded to throw them off. When I took off my socks, I felt a sense of relief, and saw the red imprint the boot left. I ordered a size up, too. I don't know if this is common for rain boots and they just have to be at a 90 degree angle and must be touching the ground at all times, or the boots design is flawed.", "These are the best!

I also ride my motorcycle with these when I know im going to have to ride in bad weather and I know my feet will always be try. I wish they had a high boot version of these.", "I was a little reluctant to buy these online. I never bought Merrell shoes before and wasn't familiar with their sizing. I initially thought I should go a half size up to account for any feet swelling or bulky thermal socks. But I went ahead and bought my exact size. Turned out to be a good decision. They fit very much like athletic shoes. A little stiffer of course. But not too stiff. I didn't even have to break them in. Very comfortable. Right amount of cushioning and support. And my feet never felt cramped even after spending an entire day in them.", "I have worn on approx 5 training hikes of about 2.5 mi each now in preparation for half dome on 7/28. They feel fantastic!

In general, I like them very much. However, these are NOT waterproof. Simply walking through damp grass is enough to thoroughly saturate the entire front half of the boot and my foot. I am very disappointed by this. I feel like I must be doing something wrong as so many others are reporting that the boots are indeed waterproof. If anyone has any thoughts on this, I'd love to hear them. At this point, I will probably return them as the waterproof claim was a primary consideration in my choice to buy them.", "UPDATE: End of life update: 6 months nearly to the day. Sole wear was as expected. Sole compaction over time was significant. I am a fat bassturd though. Daily worn boot but probably the least severe duty my boots have seen in many years. I dont expect my boots to last more than 6-8 months. It made it but just. It appears the glue problem with the sole was stopped by additional layers of glue further down. If you dont mind looking like your shoe is falling apart that'd be fine. ___________________________ 2 Months and the sole is already separating from the boot. Not very happy with these overall and definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend them.", "I read the online reviews, which were great, and excitedly purchased these boots. They fit great; felt great. I then took them to Nepal to hike the trail from Lukla to Everest Base Camp at the tail end of the rainy season. Unfortunately the boots were no match for the Nepalese Monsoon season. After one hike, I had a pool of water in each boot, and I was wearing gaiters at the time to make sure water didn't come in from the top. These are nice boots, and feel great, but they don't perform well in wet weather.", "Not sure what is going on with Merrill sizes, Been wearing them for many, many years, this is the 3rd pair that is slightly under my size. The next size up does not fit as I have tried that at local shoe store and they are just too big. :~( Quality is going downhill as well, pair before this one coming apart after 6 months. These are supposed to be a hiker style and they don't last on cement?? So what are Rocks going to do to them?", "I love Merrell shoes. These are perfect! I'm a woman with foot issues. I bought these for work because of the color, and I own another pair of these same shoes that are brown. You can tell those are men's shoes. These...not so much. My other pair has lasted me longer than any other pair of shoes I've ever worn, and I love long hikes and spend my entire day at work on my feet.", "The boot itself was well made and did not require any break in. They did not cut off circulation or dig into the top of my feet. However, there were severe pressure points where the arch of my foot joins my heel. I inspected the shoe and found that the outermost lug on the outside is actually angled, and when bent, puts pressure on the exact part of my where the pain was located. I included a photo with the lug in question circled. If it wasn't for this issue I would have gladly given it 5 stars. But, because I had to return them for being unwearable, can not give a positive review.", "I've been wearing Merrell shoes for several years, and they have always fit well. These shoes are no different. They are comfortable for all-day wear, but sturdy and waterproof for my rainy NW walking commute. They don't overheat my feet and, even the hightops, and have good arch support. I'm really pleased with my purchase. Why not five stars? Because one of the top lace loops was not secured. I had to sew it down myself. Minus a star for small quality oversight (first time with a Merrell product). Still a great shoe that I definitely recommend.", "Product I received was likely counterfeit. Instead of the \"M Dry Select\" metal gem that should've been sewn into each boot, it only said \"waterproof\". I called Merrell customer support upon seeing this, and they confirmed that their waterproof shoes should always have \"M Dry Select\" stitched to the product. I returned the product immediately and purchased direct from Merrell.", "4th pair of these. Hiking 3 times/week in Hawaii is murder on boots. Since they fixed the glue problem on the sole, I think this is my 3rd or 4th year on the ones these replaced. 15-20 miles/week on wet Volcanic trails. NOT WATERPROOF, what a ridiculous claim, but they are DUST PROOF, which is actually more important. Good sole life, actually the sides have worn out not the sole. To much falling into Volcanic rock. I\u2019ve been using \u201cHead Gasket Sealer\u201d to patch my old ones up. Much better than anything else.", "I have been wearing NOTHING but Merrell boots for 5 years. I still wear my first 2 pairs! The 5 year old pair have a worn spot from over 40k miles of my motorcycle shifter on the left toe but are still going strong! The last 2 pairs I have bought fell apart in less than a year!! (mostly sole separation) I wish I could still buy more of the 5 year old pair. If anyone from Merrell reads this, PLEASE stop focusing on quick profits by cutting quality.. You will lose many customers like myself in the long term!!", "I bought the boots as I was going to be in Ireland on vacation in the spring and knew I was going to have my share of rainy weather. The boot worked well and kept my feet dry. I wear them on rainy days, which aren't all that often for me here in So Cal, but they are nice enough for my \"business casual\" attire. They are boots, so they are heavy, probably a bit more heavy than I would like, and by the end of the vacation I was wishing I had something lighter even though I appreciated them more than once hiking up some trails.", "Boots fit great and are very comfortable. Unfortunately they just didn't last very well. Waterproofing died within 6 months of occasional use, so my feet got wet walking through wet grass. Sole began separating from the uppers shortly afterwards, so I retired them. It's pretty disappointing since I only hiked in them a few times. I wore them mostly just to and from work (where I change shoes).", "As for crossing streams in knee deep water, nothing will be waterproof when the water goes in the top. Hiked for an hour with cool water trapped inside and it was actually refreshing with no blisters. Great ankle support. I have high arches and these fit fine. Got a 9E and the toe box is really wide with no pressure on the sides of my feet which I appreciated during long hikes in Wyoming recently. *After they filled with water crossing streams I dumped them out and put them back on and stood in a few inches of water over the toe box to test and they are not waterproof, more like water-resistant. Really comfortable.", "I broke these bad boys out the box yesterday, laced up and put them to the test! Fresh out the box I felt like I was walking on clouds, extremely light weight with great traction. Grabbed my turtle shell aka \"Backpack\" and my 3 year old pitbull, hopped in the car and drove to the woods. We walked through the woods for a couple hours, across fallen trees, through the streams (not rock hopping strait puddle stompin), up and down big hills! The water wasn't higher than the laces however no moisture in the boots when I was done! No sweat or creek water! I love these boots! Keep up the good work Merrell!", "I\u2019ve had these for about a week now and they\u2019re worth every penny. They fit perfectly and feel very solid. I take my dog out a lot in the early morning hours when the grass is wet and 1 one my biggest problems is finding a boot that will keep my socks dry. So far so good. I\u2019m not splashing around in 6 inch puddles but for normal trail type walking in grass I have yet to come home with wet socks.", "If your using these for hiking they will be last longer and thats how they designed for anyways, but i use them as a work boots for my landscaping job and they are done so no good for working. Also debris goes inside of the boots all the time thats very annoying.and and laces are untied all the time thats also a big negative so not buying another ine and not recommending them . Ill be going back to Timberlands they are much better.", "I love my old Merrell Moab boots. They are comfortable and reliable. They have taken me far and wide and lasted many years. When replacing them with the same size boot, the new boots were tight. I laid the soles of the new and old boots together and noticed that the new boots were at least 1/4\" narrower. Mine are going back.", "I ordered two different pairs of the same color (green) but neither were green. Sent one back and decided to keep the second one because I gave up and figured no matter how many times I returned and re-ordered it would be the same problem (NOT SOLVED). They are excellent hiking sneaks and it is very hard for me to find shoes that fit my extra wide (5E) feet. I have had five foot surgeries and it is important for me to have good comfortable support to avoid surgery # six. The only reason they did not get five stars is because of the color discrepancy but they are definitely five star quality.", "These fit smaller than you expect! They are really tight on my feet! I bought what size I normally wear, which is what was recommended... after getting them, I could barely put them on... I do still wear them for yard work , but I don\u2019t think I would wear them out hiking...", "I am not a regular hard core hiker, but I have been over some moderately rough trails with plenty of rocks, inclines, and roots. These boots were very comfortable, gave good support for my high arches, and gave good traction. I don\u2019t know how they would hold up over hundreds of miles of the Appalachian Trail, but I don\u2019t know they wouldn\u2019t either. I would not have been happy with a cheap boot, but I doubt a $300+ pair would have been any better for me. These are perfect for the occasional hiker over any terrain. They were just what I was hoping they would be.", "I'd rate these a four considering they are not top flight hiking boots and don't pretend to be. Decent mid range boots. I knocked off a star because they are not water proof as they claim to be. They aren't even water resistant. I walk a mile and a half through my mowed field every morning when there is dew on the grass. I don't want soaking wet socks when I'm done with my walk. With these my feet are soaked. I'll still use them for my afternoon walk or when I hike in the desert but I bought them for my morning walk to keep me feet dry. In that they fail.", "Like theses boots light weight and comfortable. They have great ankle support. No real break in period wore right out the box for over 12 hours. Might be a little hot for some people bu that does not bother me. Ordered 1/2 size larger than normal shoes to allow for feet swelling at end of the day. Anyone that has ever been in Military ad road marched knows what I am talking tonight.", "I'm not impressed. I don't know what Merrell is doing, or has changed, but this being my 10th/12th pair, the quality has gone down. I bought the waterproof version because I need waterproof shoes. If you sell something as waterproof, I expect AT MINIMUM a year out of them - especially for a $100+ shoe. I got 2 and a half months out of these, and I don't do anything extraordinary aside from hose off the bottom of the sole and avoid the leather. Anytime they get wet now, it's right through. Get your manufacturing process together, Merrell. Super disappointed.", "I got this boots in the summer, used them to hike through dry conditions with the occasional stream. No problems on 9 mile hikes, although at time I wish the soles were stiffer on rocky terrain. If it's not too hot out, they breathe ok, but not great. Took them on a 8 mile mountain hike through the snow, with light crampons and gaiters, and they fared well again. They stayed dry from the outside but my feet were slightly damp at the end from sweat. No deal breakers, especially for the price, and they seem to hold up pretty well.", "The first time I wear the boots i get hit by a sprinkler and my feet get socked by just a quick spray from a sprinkler. In no way are the boots waterproof or even water resistant. other then the fact that they are not waterproof (which is the reason i got them) i worked a 8 hour shift and strait out of the box they were comfortable until my feet got socked.", "This is my second pair of the same color and model of the same boot \ud83e\udd7e; I like it that much. The previous pair has been worn daily for over a year and still is used when I\u2019m not wanting to worry about it getting a bit dirty; that is, the original shoe still has most of its sole left, and the uppers are not breaking down at all, just a bit \u2018used\u2019. If you don\u2019t love these, I would really be surprised. Use something taller when the job requires it or if the job requires a steel toe, which these don\u2019t have. Otherwise, stick your feet in a pair of sox, these shoes, and walk most anywhere.", "Cabela's discontinued the hiking shoe I loved (New Balance 974) so I had to shop for a replacement. My neighbor recommended the Merrell Moab mid hiking boot. I actually tried on a pair of Moab's at Cabela's but they only had the waterproof in brown. I found the grey color I wanted for the same price at Amazon. So far I like the Moab's better than my old 974's. The Moab has better traction with the heel and the insert that comes with the shoe gives great support. The 974 inserts were crap so I would have to buy expensive arch support inserts. The Moab's are good to go out of the box.", "I have had these boots for several months now and hiked a far amount in them. I love the way they fit and feel and they are now my go to boots. However they are not water proof or even water resistant. Just walking on wet mowed grass trails will result in my toes getting wet after a short period of time. Which is why I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5. These boots use the M-dry waterproof membrane instead of the Gore-Tex one perhaps that is the problem or perhaps these waterproof membranes really need full leather boots to work well. In any event I would not expect them to keep your feet dry in wet conditions.", "These shoes are absolutely wonderful. I don't think I'll ever buy a different brand. The fit is perfect. The support in the arch is amazing. The first pair of shoes I've had that held the arch in my foot so well. Also, from looking at the shoes you wouldn't think they were 100% water-proof, but I have tested them and they are definitely water-proof. My feet have never been so happy in a pair of shoes/boots. The tread is great on the soles as well. I haven't been hiking in them yet but I plan on doing some hiking soon. But from what I can tell so far, they won't have any issues in the field.", "I have had a number of hiking boots over the years and have heard rally good things about Merrells, so I decided to try a pair. These have been the shortest surviving shoes I have ever owned. I have had them less than a year and the upper is already separating from the outer midsole on one of the shoes. With Asolos or Danners I have always been able to go years before a failure. I have only engaged in \"light\" use of these boots (daily wear around town), so I would not have expected this type of an issue.", "Left toe box has caused my big toenail to turn black which is unusual because my right foot is a bit larger than my left. However, the right shoe fits fine. I\u2019m on a three month trek throughout Southeast Asia and I\u2019ll see how they perform otherwise. UPDATED REVIEW: Upgraded from four stars. The initial tightness went away after a few days and then they molded to my feet very nicely. I wore them daily for almost three months on the rough streets of Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam with absolutely no problems. I've destroyed many pairs of hiking boots on my trips and these are the best I've found.", "I ordered my usual size, and they fit great. I've worn them a couple of times now including camping in a wet, grassy field, and my socks stayed dry. Did some light hiking which went great, but longer hikes with a heavy load remain to be seen - but so far I'm very satisfied, no regrets. I switch between pairs of Merrell Moab 2 Ventilators every other day (I will never wear the same pair two days in a row), and those have been great, too. It's nice to see the same quality throughout their product line.", "Very supportive, cushy. I'm 5'11\" and 300Lbs with pain on the balls of my feet. These babies feel like little men supporting my ankles, and my feet wrapped with puppies. After 5 day break in, I hiked 18mi over a weekend with near no foot pain. Soles have give, but do not conform too much to the terrain. Rocky trails feel like walking on pavement with sure, flat footing instead of dropping between or bending and flexing over rocks. Climbing rocky hillsides - the big tow portion has perfect tread, allowing you to turn your feet out and dig in for great traction. Hand down the best hikers I have ever had!!", "These are the most comfortable boots I own. I am an avid hiker/ backpacker and these boots have never let me down. They provide great support, especially as I have ankle issues, and they are solid and sturdy enough to.handle any terrain. Very light, and breathable, while still being essentially waterproof (I wouldn't submerge them, but morning dew, wet grass, puddles, etc are handled with ease and keep my feet nice and dry). These feel like a comfortable pair of tennis shoes even after miles and miles. There are more expensive boots our there, but the just aren't worth the extra money. These will do for anyone e but the most extreme outdoor type.", "Shoes were very small and tight in the toe box. Another problem is the laces are so short they appear to be for another shoe. The shoes appeared to have been returned already and now I got them. I have had a pair of Merrell boots for about ten years and they were all leather. These are only half leather and the price is the same. Too bad a good product has been altered.", "I have the women's and my husband has the men's Merells .... we wore them right out of the box with no issues -- put quite a few miles hiking in GNP this past summer. I use them anytime we will be outside in the wet -- on trails. I love the high ankle support -- I have weak ankles and these are excellent. This style was recommended to me by a friend who takes LONG hikes all over the world -- I recommend them for anyone wanting a light weight good support walking/hiking shoe. I think they run true to size.", "These boots fit very well and wear extremely long. I have had a pair for over 2 years and wear them every day. The only reason for a new pair is they look a little worn for wearing as a casual shoe. The soles have a very aggressive tread which comes in great for those demanding hikes and walks in the woods. I am an avid hunter and the traction is amazing especially when having to drag a large buck up hill. I will and have recommended these boots to my friends and well lets say they have not been disappointed with their purchase. Don't hesitate and hit the buy now button.", "If you've purchased Merrell's before, you know what to expect. My last pair lasted 3 years of daily use, and was starting to show some wear, but totally serviceable .. they were passed on. Now my previous model number was too old to be found, so I bought the closest equivalent, except the higher version. This gives me more ankle support, especially gong downhill on loose gravel. The higher ankle, especially with new shoes, may incline you to use a shoehorn .. for me .. incredibly helpful and not really an option, and certainly worth the extra effort to afford such an enhancement in stability. Five Stars.", "Bought this for my local hikes. I live in the Pacific NW so it tends to get a little wet at times throughout the year. I have the ow cut version of this same shoe but although waterproof, the low cut did not provide the protection from the water that I was looking for. This shoe fit the bill and is extremely comfortable anf keeps my feet dry. I would recommend that you spray with a water repellent for added protection but not really necessary.", "Some of the most comfortable boots I've ever hiked in, but 8 days into my 2 week trip to Ireland the left boot stitching started falling apart. I bought these in hopes of putting many miles on them,but due to the poor construction I would not trust them for any trips longer than a weekend.", "I have worn a size 10 for decades, but my toes are touching the ends of these. Have ordered a size 10.5 and will update later. Looking forward to waterproof and Vibram soles! Update: Alas, these boots and I weren't meant to be. My feet felt like they were bound with rags in the 10.5. Going back with old, disappointing Timberland Pros.", "So I did the Amazon Prime Wardrobe thing. I ordered 5 pairs of hiking / trail running shoes. All major name brands! THIS WAS THE CLEAR WINNER. There were cheaper WELL KNOWN brands that failed miserably. These shoes fit perfectly from day one - no inserts, no special socks, no NOTHING! They were the most expensive. They were the best rated. And they absolutely were the best fitting, most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. PERIOD!. BUY 'EM!", "These are great boots. Waterproof in a downpour for several miles. They breathe reasonably well, though certainly not as well as vented shoes. If you plan to wear boot socks with them, definitely order at least 1/2 size larger than normal. I also found that the heel was molded a little oddly oh, and so I shaved it down a little bit to be more in line with the rest of the footbed.", "I've been wearing these for about 7 months, hiking 3-4 times a week, 2-5 miles at a time. So far they have been the best hiking boot I've ever owned. I've had plantar fasciitis in the past, with these it has completely gone away. The waterproofing is adequate for a boot with mesh panels in it. I have broken off a few lugs on the soles, but I am hiking in Northern AZ where there is a lot of sharp volcanic rock. I was a Keene boot guy in the past, but these have made me rethink that.", "What can I add to the other 500+ reviews other than I am completely satisfied with these boots. They fit perfectly right-off-the-bat. There truly is no break in period. My previous pair of Columbia boots were great, but I'm so glad I read the wirecutter recommendation for the Moab. I've used these on 3 hikes so far -- each about 6-7 miles over rocks -- and used them as my basic camp shoe. So comfortable and a such a perfect fit. Pros: * Amazingly comfortable from first wear * Good support when hiking over rocks * Seems to be an excellent value Cons * None so far", "These boots will make your foot issues much worse if you use them all day every day. My last pair went down on me in 7 weeks and that is intolerable! They were once a decent boot, but seem to be be more Chinese each time I order them. They will give you no cushion, no support and they are rigid. The strings will tighten up as the day goes on, giving your feet the feeling of being strangled. Not to worry Merrell, I will never be ordering another pair!", "I figure with the Merrell name they would be awesome. Well the fit is good the feel great I do alot of time on my feet at work. They dont do well with moisture or dirt. Constantly get pebbles in them. After 2 1/2 months my feet now hurt all the time.", "After 50 years of abuse my feet are ruined and it has forced me to retire. These are the only shoes I wear unless I have to dress formal or dig dirt in the garden. I do put new heavy duty boot insoles in, the stock one are still not enough, but I have three active pairs of these and plan to get another for dress down days at work. My wife has a pair for her job as a florist and with boot insoles she's happier than she was.", "Width is too narrow. Foot cramping. I was going to return the boots for a wider width. However, to do that, ( the same boot) I was going to be charged a much higher price, $ 20.00. That to me was improper sales expoltation. I just used a boot streacher and helped the width issue. The chain stores don't work on those type of practices with exchanges.", "My feet are made for Merrell shoes as this is 3rd pair and this time with waterproof for our Patagonia trip. First pair in different style went to Machu Pichu... These are Very comfortable, waterproof and held up well in mud, sand, rocky hiking...Love these and my same version in the low style also as good. My wife had these and returned, as Merrill is not for her - Vasque were here dream for that journey. I love Merrell", "The first pair of Merrell\u2019s I ever owned was way back when the company was in the US. They lasted more than 20 years which included tramping around in the jungles of Central America. The inside finally rotted out. They\u2019ve received a lot of bad press since then regarding shoddy construction. I don\u2019t travel anymore and haven\u2019t put very many miles on these but so far so good. I\u2019ll update in another six months.", "Excellent value. Amazon return policy outstanding as I had to order two different sizes as my foot has an unusual shape. Kudos to each vendor. Very comfortable even at end of long day. Have worn when not even raining as they keep my feet warm. I'll leave the top eyelets un-laced and have even greater comfort when I'm not worried about getting my feet wet. For my foot \"configuration\" I'd purchase these again as needed.", "These boots fits well and have great support BUT...... BEWARE.. Purchased two different styles, and had issues with the lace retention loop breaking within a year. Purchase boots in October of 2019 and loops broke in August of 2020. Have contacted and sent pictures to company as instructed, but no response since......and no replacement boots. I will NOT purchase any from this manufacture again.", "I really like this shoe/boot. It really wears like a shoe. I've noticed that the heal seems a bit more raised that the shoe version of this same line of shoes (Moab). At first it was uncomfortable, but soon became very comfortable. Perhaps it was just breaking in. Can't comment on the waterproof-ness of the boot, but I can say that there is something that sounds like paper inside. When I put my foot in the ankle portion is when I notice the sound. Perhaps a Tyvek style waterproofing instead of goretex?", "I've had a pair of Merrell boots for years now and they have been great. They are just getting old like me. The Moab two is a great replacement and fits just right. They are comfortable right out of the Box. I do some hiking around Florida where there are no mountains but sometimes some rough terrain. As far is being waterproof I do not know but the front mesh gets wet pretty quick. I have not immersed my foot in water to check it out yet.", "This is my third pair of Merrell footwear and my second pair of Moabs. I love the support that they give - not just in the arch but also the heel. The heal is soft enough that it does not feel like a hiker, but firm enough to support you wherever you go. I have unique feet and these wrap around my feet so comfortably. I was a real Keen fan, but the Merrell products are still more comfortable and, honestly, in my experience longer lasting.", "Really like the styling of these shoes and think I would have liked how they felt if they had not been smaller than expected for the size I ordered. Shipping was very prompt! I did not attempt to return the shoes because I had already worn them about 20 miles before determining that they were too small. Yep, that's on me.", "Right out of the box these boots were comfortable. I usually use simple Nike\u2019s when going on my hikes but figured I would purchase a nice boot since this would be a challenging multiple day endeavor. Wore them randomly for about 2 weeks before hiking across Catalina. No blisters no ankle pain no pressure on toes when going down hill. I would definitely re purchase. My only con is my next purchase would be the non waterproof as these do get a bit warm. I knew they didn\u2019t breath as well as the ventilated so that was a mistake on my part.", "I bought this for my husband before our trip to Tetons. He used it for 2 short (under 5 miles hikes) before we left. He absolutely loved it. Didn\u2019t cause him blisters and was comfortable. He said it felt like it was already broken in. He used it with Balega thick socks and with smart wool socks. Enjoyed it with both. We did close to 30 miles on tightly packed snow, dirt, rocks and gravel in one week and he reported that he didn\u2019t feel that it was unstable. Not sure about durability yet since it\u2019s still somewhat new with only 50 miles on it.", "Garbage! Lasted 64 days from time of purchase. Sole has started peeling off on outside of shoe. Merrell support is impossible to get a hold of, always busy signal. Very unhappy spending this much money for shoes that last such a short time As others stated, these have almost no grip. I've slipped and nearly fallen several times. Tread runs from toe to heal... hows that supposed to help slipping forward or backwards?", "UPDATE: Well its been more than a year and my Moabs are still holding up for everyday wear and tear. Im not a wilderness hiiker. I wear them in the winter months every day for warmth and to keep my feet dry. They do a nice job. IMPORTANT NOTE: They seem to be getting smaller????My other shoes dont have this problem so I dont think it me. They seem to be a 1/2 size smaller than last year. They are still water resistant, good grips, good looking, not heavy or lightweight. They are too warm for all seasons.", "Probably the most comfortable boots to wear at my job. I do a moderate amount of walking, climbing in and out of ditches and this is the 4th pair of these I\u2019ve purchased. They last approximately a year in these dry/wet conditions. Definitely will continue to use these!", "This particular Merrill hiking boot, I use primarily for all of my recreational hiking (approximately 10 miles weekly). However, I also took a pair during my recent deployment to Afghanistan. Given the mileage I put on them over six months, and the demanding (rocky, harsh) terrain in which they were used, they held up exceptionally well! In fact, the majority of my fellow deployers all wear Merrill, because they are a quality product that stands up to the most rigorous demands!", "I needed some sturdier shoes for a trip to colder climates. As it turned out it was wasn't much colder there than it was in Houston when I left. Nevertheless these shoes are quite comfortable and relatively light considering how thick the soles appear to be. Time will tell how well they hold up but they seem well made and I'm looking forward to years of service.", "I purchased these for hiking in Maui and I am glad that I got them. They are holding up well so far and have excellent grip on the rocky terrain. I am also happy to report that they are waterproof. I went through around 3 inches of water and my feet stayed dry. I have not had any issues with blisters. These are very comfortable hiking boots. It is hard to say this early on if they are durable but so far so good. I will update if things change.", "Just got them, so first impressions are that they fit perfectly and were comfortable right out of the box, no break-in required. The soles are actually extra quiet as I walk. I walked a quick 3 miles, and have only one concern, the boots are little difficult to tighten at the top. The lacing system is such that it is a little difficult to keep the laces snug at the top of the boots. Other than that the fit and feel are exceptional. I will update if any issues arise, but I looked a long time before pulling the trigger on these over other brands. I think I have a winner.", "This is my fourth pair of Merrell\u2019s, but the first as a full boot . These waterproof hikers were comfortable right out of the box and a six mile hike in snow, ice and mud showed they were better than anything I\u2019d previously worn. As long as they keep making these I\u2019ll be buying them. Very rugged, well made and clean up easily.", "I wrote a review for these by accident on the Timberland Ledge which were returned and refunded but showed up for my review I assumed I was talking about this pair of Merrell Moab of which I love they look and feel like they were custom made just for me. I normally wear a mens 10.5 wide I ordered the size11 ee and viola a Perfect fit! No issues I can now stand my ground on steep wet grassy hills while working out with my over zealous German Shepherd.", "I purchased these shoes for my new job. I started a job in solar and spend 6-7 hours a day on a roof. The fellas at work all said to buy this brand shoe. I took their advice and ordered a half size smaller and the shoe is perfect. Great traction, very comfortable. Flexes in the right way and very durable. To be honest, it\u2019s one of the best shoes I\u2019ve ever bought and worn. These will be my go to shoe for work from here on out.", "1. They fit. Beautifully. 2. Wide range of colors...for those who want to play matchy-matchy. 3. Great traction on slippery surfaces. 4. Cool and comfortable on my old dawgs - even in triple-digit Texas! 5. For Merrell - Don't ever stop or change this line...you'll never match them again.", "Very pleased Bought these because I have a pair of similar footwear by Merrill and they have been comfortable These are even better. Wore them straight out of the box and they feel great Have worn them on several short hikes and like their width and stability on rough trails Gave 4 stars because I haven\u2019t had chance to try them in wet conditions yet", "I own 2 pairs of the Merrell Moab Ventilators and I figured I'd give the waterproof ones a try - while they're a comfortable, sturdy \"hiker\" ( I work for Fedex and wear these on colder wetter days and they work good ), it's the same problem with anything \"waterproof \" ... you sweat and your feet get wet I've been wearing these driving, hiking, working and running a couple days a week since Dec 2018 and they're a bit heavy but keeps the cold water out and the warm sweat in Buy them on sale ... the Beluga color is real nice", "Pros: A lot of value for your money. You don't need to break-in any of their boots. True to size and size is consistent between styles and from year to year. Quality is excellent. Waterproof is actually waterproof. Comfortable for all-day wear. Cons: none that I could find. Price is very competitive and you can find them on sale a couple times a year.", "great boot, but for me it needed to be 1/2 size larger. also the dusty olive, a favorite of mine, is not available in the this shoe from Merrill any more. so it was great to be able to get it from Amazon in the size I needed. will probably order another pair to have ready when needed. Delivery was one day early! great boot and very comfortable", "I have been buying these for about 6 years now as work and everyday wear. They are very comfortable and hold up to my work environment which is extremely harsh. Those work conditions included a steel boat deck that is regularly above 165\u00b0 F, oil, diesel, gas, water (immersion and splash), fiberglass marina decking, salt, ice, snow, sun, sand and assorted bodily fluids/by products. Most shoes I buy don't even hold up to 2 months. They either lose the sole, rip in the side or the back blows out. These are by far the best shoes and boots I have found. I highly recommend these boots.", "I shopped around a lot before deciding on this shoe. I wear a 4e in tennis shoes and I got the wide with in this shoe. I think that because it is a hiking shoe it was wider to begin with so a wide fit well. I tried other shoes and they were too skinny and some of the other wide ones jammed your toes into the toe box when you walked. So over all this is a great shoe and worth the purchase.", "I would give this a 4.5 the only bad thing I have to say about this is the goot pad that comes with it. It didn't offer much comfort, so I had to buy a different kind. Other then that the boot worked great for me for my 3 day expedition. They are not water proof but they do offer some resistance to water. Good grip, and support. Didn't wear and tear. And I abused them alittle bit by using them for rock climbing. And the best part I didn't get any blisters using them. So I enjoyed them and think it was worth the money.", "I am hard on shoes and usually blow out the sides in less than 3 months (I have wide feet). This is my 4th pair of Merrell Moab shoes in 4 years, one pair per year. I am a farmer and ware these shoes 12 - 16 hours per day. These shoes are tuff, solid, great arches, come in wide sizes. I keep buying them as they are the best I have ever had.", "Great fit, superb traction even on wet rocks, but not waterproof. I was actually very disappointed that my right sock kept on getting soaked in the light rain we experienced. Maybe some QC issues since my left sock was dry?", "Have worn Merrell's for years, however this is my first mid-boot pair. Same great quality and fit. Merrell's 2E width is a true wide width that provides room, comfort, and support.", "This is the first pair of hiking boots I've purchased in 30 years. Having kept my previous pair for that long, you really had to live up to greatness. The Merrell Moab 2 Mid is well worth every penny. They were comfortable out of the box and they keep getting better. I can't imagine any other hiking boots fitting any better. I made my selection using the Prime Wardrobe service to try on several pairs and brands and it was flawless too. Overall I am extremely satisfied!", "This is exactly what i needed for my long hikes in Yosemite park and King canyon. Quite comfortable, fairly light and quite protective. They are not 100% waterproof, but at the same time protected me very well on the wet ground and in small (not too deep) creeks. But again, only rubber boots could be 100% waterproof. Thus, i would consider them partially waterproof and enough for hiking in the normal weather condition.", "First... I\u2019m 5\u20198 and 287 pounds. Definitely not a \u2018toned hiker\u2019. I needed a boot that would allow me to hike long distance with good support. Sunday- hiked 5.5 miles Monday- hiked 17 miles in 13 hours These boots are the best pair I have ever owned- period. Very strong support on bottom and ankle support. I haven\u2019t hiked more than 10 miles in one day since 2000 when I was in the Army (19 years ago and 100 pounds ago). These boots are AMAZING.", "I got these to hike in Iceland. They were awesome. They gripped the ground and rocks. Wet rocks too that I thought would be slippery. Not with these shoes. I never once came close to slipping. I walked miles in these and they were extremely comfortable. I even walked through shallow water areas and never felt my feet getting wet. I also hiked a glacier and lava tube in them. They look and feel good. Great shoes.", "This is my 2nd pair of Moab hiking boots. The Moab 2 fit better and were more comfortable than the 1st pair of Moab Hiking boots I owned. But, until Moab 2, I was completely satisfied with. The Moab 2 is everything I wanted in a hiking boot and more. I have not utilized the waterproof feature in this pair, but based on the original Moab I had, I expect it will give me at least the same high quality of the first pair.", "Good looking footwear and as expected quality for the Merrell brand. I replaced the insoles for more foot arch support as needed. I work in a variety of terrains, from urban to open fields or woodland environments, and in unpredictable north eastern weather. Having to be on my feet sometimes up to 18 hr shifts, these mid ankle waterproof boots are reliable and so far manageable with keeping my feet dry and breathable enough that my feet are less fatigued and not overheated. The insoles that ship with the boots would be sufficient enough for normal recreational day hikers.", "Threw away my uncomfortable, no support Solomon hiking boots for these boots and i cant believe i waited this long, the Merrell hiker is fantastic!!! I bought them because they had such a high rating and I wasnt disappointed, i love them! They were delivered Friday , took a 7.50 mile hike Saturday (Red River Gorge) and needed ZERO \u201cbreaking in\u201d time. Toe box had plenty of room, nice arch support and plenty of cushion.", "There are a lot of things to love about these boots. I put almost 100 miles on them over the last 2 weeks and these have kept me safe and comfortable. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I felt the inside of the boot was too tall, I have insoles in there and they are still too spacious vertically. I have to really cinch the laces down to get them snug and I've never had that issue before. Like I said, it hasn't been an issue and they've been great, maybe just a personal preference.", "Wanted to wait sometime before giving a review. Last brand name hiking boots I had close to a year. Hiking over same rocks one day and my foot got a sharp pain. The sole of these boots were flexible to a point that it felt like I could stick my finger through it. With the currant hiking boots. They are a world of difference. Much better quality, made , comfort. Hiking same rocks even more secure and don\u2019t even feel the rocks as much as the first few times with the other brand name boots.", "I'm more of a tennis shoe guy, but these have become my every day footwear. They are comfortable, and I don't have to worry about them getting wet, etc. For me, my tennis shoe sizing was spot on for these as well. I have no idea how long they will last since I don't really abuse them, but so far, they are great!", "The only thing that's bad on these shoes is the shoe laces....they will not stay tied unless hard knots are tied....this is about the 9 th or 10 th pair....they are all same....the laces toward toe always tighten up quickly and squeeze toes together.....good shoes but could be a lot better with small changes....", "I had a pair of Merrell shoes and for some reason they are a 10.5 reg. They weren't real comfortable - my doing not correct size. I usually wear a 10 wide. I guess I ordered a 10.5 reg. b/c 10 wide wasn't available. Anyway saw these new Merrell hikers in 10 wide. I got 'em and man, are they comfortable! Great hiking boot.", "I'm on my third pair of these boots. I wear them a lot, and I hike in them a lot. I find that for me, they last about 14-16 months before I need to buy a new pair. Given how much I use them, I think that's more than fair. I'm very satisfied, and I'll continue to purchase these boots, and recommend them. They're super comfortable right out of the box, too.", "These boots are beyond comfortable and provide so much support and traction for a big man like myself, I can cross over rocks and push up and down hills and even wet rocks it no issue, pair these with some hiking poles and you\u2019ll never have any discomfort hiking, and these babies are waterproof I\u2019ve crossed streams ankle deep with my feet dry afterwords.", "These are nice hiking shoes/boots. Last week I went for a walk in the neighborhood and wore them. My wife asked why wasn't I wearing my running/walking shoes. These were just fine, a bit heavier than a running shoe, but about the same as general purpose sneaker. Oh, and they worked great for the hills in Costa Rica too.", "I got the wide size after trying on a non-wide pair. I usually don\u2019t get wide shoes, but these are great for me in wide. I also use shoe inserts with moderate arch support, but would have chosen these even if I didn\u2019t use support. Good traction. Have not tested the water proof qualifies yet. I would recommend.", "This is my 2nd pair. Got the 1st pair for hiking and then used them as a work boot for the comfort and light weight. They've been great for both uses. Not waterproof(have vents), but unless you're standing in water or pouring rain, your feet will stay dry. Traction great for lawn work and hiking. Happy with them.", "These perform consistently with other Merrell products so far. No quality complaints. Note that for safety you *must* use the speed-lacing hooks (and tuck shoelaces), or pinch them closed with needle-nose pliers, otherwise they can catch on things and present a serious trip hazard as they will not break away.", "I work on Highrise building in NYC. As they go up, I meet all kinds of conditions that can destroy my feet. Rebar, water that sometimes puddles 3 inches or more deep, ice, concrete dust, sheetrock dust, nails/screws, holes/chunks of concrete sticking up. These boots hold up to the conditions really well. They are pretty good at keeping my feet dry and warm. I have been wearing Merrells for years and will continue to do so.", "I read some of the reviews and i was skeptical. But honestly, they were great. I think most expect to go on a crazy huge/long hike with them. But these feel like more of a short mountain hike on Saturday kind of boots. I used them for a hike in Sedona and they were perfect. Nothing to complain about.", "I really like the lightweight of this hiking boot. Obviously...with very lightweight materials the long term durability is suspect....but....I will not know that for some time. I found that for me...these boots size just a bit smaller than similar Garmont or Salomon hiking boots. I ordered this one in an 11. I will keep it as they will stretch a bit....but if I ordered again I would go with an 11.5", "This is my all purpose hiking and every day shoe. I have owned five pairs over the years and presently own two. I generally don't buy shoes online, but since I was wearing the same shoe when I ordered these, it was simply a matter ordering the same exact size and width. Its my favorite!", "I am giving it 2 stars because the manufacturer/seller are knowingly lying when they describe it in the title as waterproof. It is not even water-resistant. Water touches the top of the shoes and instantly you feel it on your toes. Many of the products sold here are advertised using a bunch of lies. Amazon should crack down on false advertisement.", "These are really comfy hiking boots. I normally need 4E wide shoes, and the wides here are perfect. The soles take a bit of breaking in but that only took a week of walking around to do that. They are waterproof at least for the bit of wading I did in them. Feet were dry afterwards, and they are easy to hose clean. Very nice!", "These boots are very comfortable and very well made. This pair is my first Merrell purchase but I know it will not be my last. For me, they feel as if they were made just for my feet. Very happy with my choice. Positive reviews about Merrell products encouraged me to purchase these boots. Thx!", "I've owned many Merrell hiking boots in the past. All fit. This pair was so tight in the toe width and because I trust this company, I wore them for four months and caused quite a lot of damage to my feet before figuring out it was these boots. They were the same size as any other I have purchased so I don't know what went wrong. I'm now only purchasing these in person.", "I was planning a Lassen Peak hike and only had some cross trainer shoes that I use for day hikes. Reading about snow and the lava rock, I purchased a pair of these Merrell Moab 2. They arrived 5 days before my hike so I wore them for a 5 mile hike in Annadel Park to test them. No problems at all. No blisters or toe pain. They felt like trainers. Four days later, we did the Lassen hike and they were great. No foot pain, no wet feet when crossing some snow pack. I am very pleased with these boots. I wear 11 in Nike shoes and an 11 with the Moab 2.", "My last beloved pair finally wore out after seven years and I knew I needed a new good pair of boots for the winter so I went looking for another pair or Merrells. These fit great, look great and were comfortable out of the box, just like my last pair were. I'm looking forward to years of enjoying the Moab 2s!", "I've been getting into hiking this year and decided to buy a pair of nice hiking boots. After some research I ended up going with Merrells. I really love these boots! They fit very well. Nice a supportive and not too tight. I wore these daily for a few weeks to break them in. After which we went to Scotland for vacation. I did a few shorter hikes and one all day hike wearing my new boots. My feet stayed dry and felt great all day. Very happy with my purchase!", "Comfortable boot but don\u2019t expect them to last. I don\u2019t think you could actually call these waterproof, maybe splash proof, but what got me was the life span. 4 months and the sole started separating footbed was shot and water resistance was nonexistent. For what they cost a big disappointment.", "I have owned several pairs of merrell hiking boots and they are hands down the best! There is really not even a break in period. They fit like tennis shoes but they feel very sturdy/substantial/supportive while being light weight on the trail. I have plantar fasciitis and the arch support in these boots is so good I don't need the insert I wear in other boots. They are waterproof and the sole has excellent traction. Regardless of the reasonable price I don't know why anyone would choose any other brand over these boots.", "I do a LOT of hiking. I need a pair that will hold up to rugged terrain. The First pair lasted two years. I thought maybe six months or a year tops. So, now I\u2019m on ghe second pair. They are SLIGHTLY heavy but my expierence with lighter wt is they fall apart or hurt my feet - sometimes both!", "I have been buying Hi Tec hiking boots for years that I wear for work. The boots have been adaquate for work use as a truck driver. This is the first time I have purchased Merrell boots and I have been wearing them for one week now. WOW what a difference in boots. The Merrill boots have more support for my feet and the arch has much better support. The only negative I would give the Merrill boots is that they are about one half size too small. My toes aren't being squeezed but they aren't a perfect fit for me.", "These boots fit perfect right out of the box. Went on a short one mile hike and had no issues with the fit. Nothing rubbed or caused any hot spots. Only issue is that there is little cushion in the insole. I recommend buying after market insole for more comfort on long hikes.", "Not \u201cwaterproof\u201d. I was satisfied w/ my purchase upon receipt, but after going through a real test these boots failed. I had to field outdoors in the rainstorms that Hurricane Florence brought into the Carolina\u2019s. The hours of rain & wet grass left my boots soaked, from the surface to the the insoles. The inner padding was drenched. My feet were pruned from being inside of wet socks and boots all day. I left the boots outdoors to dry & it took days for them. The smell left inside of them is funky that shoe freshener didn\u2019t help. If waterproof boot is what you\u2019re in need of, pass on these. They\u2019re a good boot if you simply need a boot.", "I have other pairs of Merrell shoes for running. They have been on the smallish side. They do break in though. These boots fit perfectly with standard socks (one pair). If you wear thick Merino socks or two layers of socks for hiking, or if your feet swell when hiking, you may want to go up a half a size. I have been wearing them pretty much non-stop since they showed up and they feel great! I haven't been on a long hike with them yet, but I presume that they will be excellent.", "One of favorite hiking boots to date. I do 2-3 weeks a year at a national park and take dozens of weekend trips to the Badlands or state parks with 10 hour drives of MN. I came from Solomon Ultra 2 GTX's, and the MOAB's have surpassed them leaps and bounds. I was blown away by the comfort and reliability of these boots throughout my last 3 trips. I highly recommend these for anyone interested of a cost effective, high caliber hiking boots.", "Nice boot, fit well, comfortable but not in the slightest are they waterproof. I walk several miles a night at work on a horse farm and I can't even walk through the dew covered grass without my feet being completely soaked.", "I sent these back since they were just too big, I did order the wide size. They did not seem as comfortable as Keen boots to me and rubbed on my ankle.", "I I bought this shoe many times, usually about 2 pairs a year. The quality has been dropping. The shoes are now falling apart faster, they don't seem to be as made as well as they used to. Originally started purchasing these shoes because they matched my rugged lifestyle and they actually stand up to the abuse that I put them through. Generally it's been reasonable to expect between 6 and 8 months of life from the shoes, now I'm not sure if these shoes will even last three to four months", "I have fussy feet, long and narrow with large toes and high arches, and these sz 11 M\u2019s are about as good a fit as one can get without having boots custom made: wide in the toe, padded tongue, arch support, waterproof, well constructed, excellent sole, not too hot or heavy - what\u2019s not to love? Best low-top work and walking boot i\u2019ve ever owned.", "This is my fourth pair of the Moab's, but my first pair of the Moab 2. If there is one thing I don't like about these it is the laces are shorter than the originals. That's the only thing. I am a person who always double knots my laces and these are just long enough to do that with no extra length. I like the color also. Beluga is basically slate grey, but on the darker side. Super comfortable as I am on my feet all day. Just great boots.", "While I do not use for traditional hiking, these are good hiking books for moderate to heavy yard work. They provide good support, ankle stability and better foot protection than tennis shows (while not being a steel / reinforced toe boot) while still being fairly light weight. Fit is true to size", "i wear these shoes on hikes all the time they have survived old settlers trail in the smokies (all 19 miles in snow) charleys bunion well a whole lot of trails about 400 miles worth they are still going strong ( the tread is a bit worn) to be expected ) if I could get another pair exact to what I have now I would buy 2 pair", "Arrived on time and as expected. First time trying this brand and they are the most comfy boots I've ever worn, and I don't think they need a break in period. I have no idea how long they will last, and I didn't test for water resistance, but frankly even if they weren't waterproof out of the box as others have complained about I would scotch guard them rather returning them, they're that comfy!", "I really like the feel and the way the boot holds steady on rocks while hiking. My first boot I put on many miles before they wore out on the toe. If I had one complaint it would be my feet get hot on some hikes. Might be only due to my feet. I really enjoy these boots though.", "I had high hopes for these boots. They looked great and the Merrill brand is known for quality. They sat in a box for a month and a half and I missed the return window for Amazon. I wear a size 11 and these in 11 ran small. I\u2019d love to exchange them for a larger size, but because I missed the window, I think I\u2019m stuck with them. Bottom line: order a 1/2 size larger.", "Took the shoes out of the box, put them on, then walked 1/2 mile. No need to break in, extremely comfortable, and no tight spots. Will work well on my trip to Iceland in a few months. Especially important is the waterproof shoe. It is recommended to have such on the trip.", "As of owning these for 2 weeks and using them twice: The first time I got a blister on my ankle, used better socks and problem solved. The second time was working on a farm and they performed well. Was worried about mud mainly, but they protected my feet. I didn't lace them up all the way, because when I did that they seemed too constrictive on my ankles so kept them one notch below. I really like these shoes and am looking forward to taking them on an actual hike. If anything changes about my opinion of these, I'll update this. Other than that, for the price, I'd recommend these for comfort, protection and versatility.", "Perfect for my hike up Mt. Kilimanjaro. Worked extremely well. Nicely weather resistant. Only a minimal amount of dirt got inside my boots when descending, but that's very common since it's all loose dirt on the descent. But otherwise, it kept everything out! I didn't even wear gaiters. They felt very comfortable almost the entire time (minus the descent, but any shoes are uncomfortable during that misery). Overall these were great.", "I've only owned these for a couple of months, but they're the best walking and hiking footwear I've owned in a while. I fined them to be properly firm and lightweight, and they stand up to the beatings I tend to give my shoes.", "My feet have never been happier! A wide boot that's actually wide. I have 4e feet and these are the closest thing I can find to a wide boot. Many companies advertise wider wid th but it's nothing really wide wide! The ankle support is nice and keeps out all the trail rocks.", "Excellent shoe with Vibram soles. Great traction while hiking and walking around in light snow and rain. Kept my feet warm and dry with just one pair of socks on. They do get a little warm if you are wearing these in warmer temperatures. Would buy the shoes again for sure. I usually wear a 10.5-11 men\u2019s, I ordered an 11 and had no issue with fit. My feet do not slide around in boot and I didn\u2019t get any blisters", "I had already bought a pair at a local outdoor retailer, when I saw these at HALF the price. I normally bought Hi Tec's, but after a trio of problems, I started looking elsewhere. I've been happy with the Merrill brand so far. I would recommend them.", "Merrell boots are great... 20 years ago they were even better....(I wish merrel would bring back those 1990 models with the same construction these boots last a good long time and I work construction... I get at least 1 year out of a pair of MOAB..the soles usually separate after 1 year...like most boots now a days I bought SOLOMAN boots but the soles broke within 3 months---they are not as good as Merrell...", "Purchased for a trip to Scandinavia. Expected cold weather and however it was the warmest season on record. The shoe is heaver than a standard walking shoe but does provide good arch and ankle support. I will see how it performs in wet weather condition in the future and update this review.", "I walk 10 miles or more a day for work and these are holding up amazingly well. Waterproofing is still working but I expect like my Redwings that will go away in another month or so. Super comfortable and did not hurt breaking in (Very rare in my experience)", "This is a light weight strong hiking boot that stabilizes your feet, there is no slippage or rubbing. I like them so much that I purchased a second pair in order to rotate them. I am in my seventies and the quality of this boot allows me to walk without pain.", "I like that they have a good heal. So many hiking type boots these days have a fake heal. In which your heal is only like a 1/4\" inch from the ground. These have a heal that your foot sits on, not in. These lose their waterproofness pretty fast though.", "Bought them and returned them the same day. They were way too small for their marked size. They were quite boxy and overall quality seemed to be just ok. Overly puffy tongue I thought, too.", "While Merrell boots fit and wear well as with all \"waterproof\" boots it's wide open to interpretation as what degree they are \"waterproof\". That being said, they do dry quickly, very little break in was required and OR gaiters work well with these boots.", "i usually wear an 11 1/2 - went with a 12 to give my foot a bit extra room ( thick socks ). with the 12 i did get extra length, the width seemed a bit narrow, for me. the sole color is different than those I've had previously - . i like the look. JDS /CT 8-2019", "The boots arrived on the expected day & are great. They fit perfect & are very comfortable, barely had to 'break them in'. Haven't had a chance to try them out in the wet yet, but as they are waterproof, I expect them to be perfect for the outdoor work I often do. Would buy from this seller again!", "Love my new shoes. Came quick and in prefect condition. I\u2019ve put about 20 miles on them now, and they feel great. I can already see wear and tear on them which is lame. I doubt these will last me more than a year -year and a half but we shall see. I\u2019ll update if these come up", "Very comfortable after breaking in. Initially they were very tight and I was worried I'd picked the wrong size, but some lacing adjustments and a week of break-in and they're great. Look nice too. I vary between a size 12 and 13 depending on brand. About 60-70% of the time I'm a size 13. I bought 12 with these and got the right fit, so if you're considering 2 sizes, I'd go with the lower one.", "Awesome boots. Super comfortable, look good, and fit right. Traction is decent (comparable to most other hiking boots). Bought these after trying Columbia but having to return them because they were horribly loose and uncomfortable. These are the comfiest pair of boots I've owned.", "Ordered these for my husband for a backpacking trip after trying them on in Academy Sports ($20 cheaper on amazon) He wore them basically right out of the box and hiked 22 miles in a weekend and it was pouring down rain the whole time. He said his feet never got wet. He also is extremely flat footed and these are probably the 1st pair of boots/shoes he has never complained about. He loves them!", "Very nice. I wish it vented a bit better. But I found a sock on Amazon with amazing moisture wicking. This solved the sweaty feet issue, which I assume was a function of the waterproof design. These aren't the best cold season hikers I've ever owned, but were priced right and look like a they'll hold up.", "I love these boots so much that I haven\u2019t even worn out the ones that I\u2019m wearing yet, and even though they are over a hundred bucks, I already have two new pairs in the closet ready to go for when I need them. I like to be ready like that.", "Comfortable boots, but tread could be better. I have used these MOAB 2's on hikes that I did with my steel toed work boots (which I bought these to replace as hikers) and have found myself slipping more in these than I have in my work boots. As for comfort, these beat my work boots hands down! My feet are so much happier in these. I just wish the soles of these boots gripped the trail a bit better.", "I am a female, but always buy men's boots because they have a larger toe box and I never have issues. This is the first time I have ordered boots online and I was very nervous about it. I had my first hike in them this Monday and they were awesome (9 miles). The boot had everything I need: Vibram sole, arch support, water-proof and rugged enough for rocky irregular terrain. My initial response is 5 stars. I will let you know later how they hold up and adjust that rating if necessary. .", "Right out of the box I hiked about 10 miles in Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks and they were very comfortable. Good traction and support, didn\u2019t get wet so can\u2019t comment regarding ability to keep feet dry. I ordered 1/2 size larger than my normal shoe and the fit was great.", "The supplied insole is not ideal for people with large feet or people who need a lot of arch support. I wear a 12 EE and my heel sits too far forward with the standard insole. Not a ton of support around the ankles, but they are well made and pretty grippy on the ground. I replaced the Merrell insole with the Kenetrek Support insole after trying some Smart feet. The Kenetreks seemed to have solved the problem of support & of heel placement.", "Didn't last long...one of the loops that holds the laces ripped off after 3 months... only 60 day warranty update .. after about 3 more weeks the same loop ripped off on the other shoe. Had to pay to have them sewn back on by local shop. had them upgrade the factory stitching and now they seem to be holding up", "I took these straight out of the box and went on several tough hikes in Northern New England including a hike up Mt. Washington. No break in needed. Felt really good and supportive on my feet. These hikes were mostly dry with some mud and wet rocks and traction was not an issue. I wear a size 9 sneaker and size 9 was a good fit.", "Great shoe. I wore these on a week long elk hunt in Colorado and they preformed excellent, not 1 blister. We hiked up and down the mountains averaging 6 or 7 miles a day. The one complaint i have is that they are not completely waterproof. Walking through the heavy dew, or in the rain, my socks did get wet when water seeped through the fabric. I plan on treating several times with a water repellent and wearing them again next year. Pros: Lightweight comfortable Cons: not completely waterproof", "These looked and felt rugged enough for what I needed them for. Fall and winter hiking. Tried these on at a big box store and they fit great. Bought these on amazon cause they were $25 cheaper and they were to small for me wearing thin socks. Wouldn\u2019t have worked at all with thicker wool socks. Returned for a refund. If you buy these get a half size or full size larger.", "Have tried to use these for work and hiking over the past year and the right boot is defective, hurts my arch, i have another pair of Moabs, same size and everything and they work fine, i went in, tried them on bought them directly from a store. will never buy shoes online again as i believe a lot of what is being sold are factory irregulars at lower prices and they are not worth taking a risk on", "I wanted to like these boots. They look great and I\u2019ve tried to \u201cbreak them in.\u201d There is something wrong with the construction of the area under the heel. The rise in the arch hits mid heel and makes them uncomfortable to wear. This problem is in both shoes so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a defect. I\u2019ve owned four different types of Merrell shoes and boots and I\u2019ve always been satisfied. This pair is poorly designed and causes pain if worn for any length of time.", "Very comfortable with fairly good ankle support - nice for the Loyalsock. Not as waterproof as expected, but then again I've had a lot of hiking boots and none really are (only my hunting boots are truly waterproof -but too heavy for hiking).", "Boot seems like a good hiking boot so far but far snugger than expected. Not sure if this is because I am used to combat boots without the padding, if it needs to break in, or if I am just getting older and fatter, but wish i had bought a half size larger.", "Repeat Merrill wearer. Quality materials, great, comfortable, accurate fit, straight out of the box. Used to hike around PNW and Alaska last Summer, (Pre-C19). No blisters, good grip on wide variety of terrain. Would buy again!", "My husband purchased these for work. He is on his feet for 12 hours straight and these have held up decent. He says the fit is great. However they did start wearing on the soles a lot quicker than expected so they won\u2019t last him as long as we had hoped.", "I have a neuroma in one foot, and over the years my feet have gotten wider (now a men's 10.5 EEEE) and I have an orthotic that takes up some space. I bought a black RedWing boot that has a huge and very solid toe cap, and it's great. However, this one is far better for me - it fits almost perfectly (just a wee close on the big toe), the inside is nice and soft, it doesn't weigh too much, and it's very solid - and waterproof. My new favorite boot!", "These boots were advertised as waterproof. I got them for an elk hunting trip in Idaho. I new it would be raining and have a lot of dew on the ground. I ended up having wet feet for 12 days. On a positive note, they fit perfectly and were comfortable out of the box. To were when it is not wet they would be great.", "I was replacing an older worn-out pair of size 12 Merrells. This pair of Merrells is just a bit snug, should have ordered 12.5 instead. Why the heck does the same style boot from the same manufacturer differ in size?", "used these on my trip to up state NY. they are incredibly comfortable. i had an infection on the heel of my foot and the comfort of the shoe helped me be able to get out and still do some light hiking! i heard they were good, read some reviews and obviously there are always karen\u2019s who have something to complain about but those people are crazy. this shoe is legit!", "I love these hikers. They were comfortable from Day 1, and I have a wide foot for a woman. That\u2019s why I tend to get Men\u2019s Hikers. The arch support, which I need badly and is also important to me, is just right as well, not too much & not too little. They have worn well through rain and snow while I hike moderate hills. I recommend these highly!!!", "Tried them on in store before ordering online. The online version is apparently 1/2 smaller or so than the in store version. And yes I was trying to make sure I had wiggle room on the front end for hiking downhill,", "This was advertised as new but was clearly a B product with a strange hump in the upper front of each shoe.", "The laces come undone all the time and I get stuff stuck in them all the time, but these are kind of to be expected. They really are waterproof up to the top which really blew my mind. Never owned boots like this before. Good grip.", "WOW. These are SO comfortable. Probably the most comfortable shoe I have every worn. I haven't done any long hikes yet - only about 3 miles maximum, but they were great.", "It's always a gamble buying shoes online because the true description doesn't always match the product. With this seller, everything I hoped for was spot on. My shoes look amazing, fit absolutely perfect and feel awesome on my feet. Bravo Zulu guys/gals", "Very comfortable right out of the box, looking forward to hiking half dome later in June to put them to the real test, but very impressed by the fit and feel as soon as I put them on, I would definitely buy another pair of Merrell boots in the future.", "I took off one star due to any time i wear these my feet just sweat really badly. It just might be me, so i wasn't too aggressive w/ the rating. Overall i like these boots and have last two years in ohio's winter. Ive wore these on two hikes, i dont suggest it..", "These are fantastic boots! Kept me dry and comfortable on my first hike with them. Only about 4 miles but they held up great!", "Craftsmanship, stitching, overall finish is very good. Surprisingly light. Very happy! I didn't rate arch support. I take them out and use Powerstep Pinnacle Maxx. I do this to all my shoes, so my fit rating is consistent with other shoes.", "I VERY RARELY buy footwear online as I find it rare to have a shoe in my size actually be comfortable for my feet. I was very surprised when I first put these on - they felt comfortable from the start. I've put a few miles on them and they seem to just get better and better, which is good because I'm breaking them in for some mountain climbing this coming summer.", "These are fairly comfortable but only one shoe was waterproof. I don't wear these often (like 15 times) so wear didn't turn these into junk, and the left shoe leaks. These are now worthless. Who want's a pair of hot hiking boots? I probably move on to another brand now that I have to buy a new pair of waterproof shoes. Two bad Merrell purchases in a row. Maybe it's time to try something else. $130 thrown away.", "I've always liked Merrell but they tended to run on the narrow in fit. I've put on around a couple hundred miles on the wide fit boots now and really like the fit. In fact I bought a second pair and will relegate my first pair to yard work;-)", "I had to get a half size bigger than I normally wear but once you get the correct size these boots feel GREAT. The boot cups your heel and makes you feel confident in your foot wear when your hiking.", "These are hands down the most comfortable shoes/boots I've ever worn in my entire life. I bought these with the intention of using them for hiking but now I'm looking to get a similar pair for everyday use. My only complaint is that they are not very breathable (but they're waterproof so it's one or the other).", "I was able to wear these shoes for about a week before they were put to the water proof test. We had a major thaw that required me to shovel a path of snow for the water to drain away from the house. Multiple times I stepped in water that would completely cover the shoe or go over my ankle. Once completed, my feet were still dry and comfortable. Very impressed!", "Probably the most comfortable boot I have had for work, On my feet all day, HVAC mech at a University and these boots helped my feet a lot. I'm 6'4\" 265 lbs and they are holding up well. Would buy again.", "I wish I could say that they fit great out of the box like the last ones I bought but they did not. I am hoping they will stretch as I go along. My feet are hard to fit, but not that hard. When they say 3 wide you should not worry that is what you are getting. It is sad to say now a days you should worry. Good luck on your order. I do not know if Merrell has stop caring about their customers or profit is their goal?", "I love them! I have only walked in them, no hiking because our trip was cancelled due to COVID-19. The shoes have been great so far! No fatigue and very comfortable. I have high arches and this shoe provides nice support! PS - I\u2019ve maybe walked 100 miles in them so far, still comfortable.", "I like the fit and support of these hiking boots. However, 'M Select Dry' is definitely not waterproof or even water resistant! When walking on a wet trail or in wet grass, my forefoot gets wet almost immediately! Go for GoreTex next time!", "I bought these brand new for a hiking trip and if you're going to call your product waterproof it better be waterproof. Walking in wet grass and shallow puddles for an hour or so I could feel the damp cold water coming in and soaking my socks. They are comfortable in cold weather a bit to warm for over 50\u00b0f I wear these daily and work outdoors, they go on the boot drier every night.", "I love this boot. I had an earlier version of the boots years ago and ordered this one to replace it. It came as expected, but there is a minor bit of trim on the inside that would cut into my leg. After using it for work for a few weeks (While it cut up my ankle) I returned the boot to Merrell and the replaced it for free. Love these boots.", "Couldn\u2019t get any help .. the show are only a couple months old bought them in May now split in Aug", "Took me awhile to figure out to run a search on hiking boots in wide size. I do it with running shoes all the time. Anyway it fits great! True to size, well consistent with the size i always wear. I wear a 9.5 Extra wide usually and that's what I ordered. The only thing I was skeptical about was it being water proof even though it's mesh and not full leather. I'll put it to the test and if it's not, so be it. I can use them in warm weather and get the full waterproof leathers later.", "This was the first time buying shoes online, I was concerned about how hard it would be to return them, they fit perfectly so there was no need. I'm very happy because the shoe store in my town had the same shoe but as always not the size or color I wanted.", "Only caveat is the room in toe box. Seems just a tad tight. Hopefully it\u2019ll stretch out over time. Have only them a short while but so far so good. Will have to write an updated review after seeing wear over time.", "This is comfortable and attractive walking / hiking shoe, and I wear it a lot. However, the top loop has twice fallen out. It wasn't stitched well to the shoe. The first time, I called the company and they sent a new pair of shoes. This time, I will try to repair it myself. Absence of the loop doesn't make the show unwearable, but the quality should be better than this.", "I have been wearing Merrell boots for many years. I always considered them the most comfortable and well made boot that I have owned and I worked construction for many years. But this pair of boots was pathetic from a comfort point of view. I don't see how anyone could wear these hiking. I couldn't get out of the living room without removing these shoes. What happened to Merrell. Never again.", "Nice and light with good ankle protection. I have only put 10 or so miles on them so far but no blisters and they feel quite good. Several of those miles were on loose ankle twisting rocks and the boots provided good traction and protection for my ankles. I would recommend them.", "These are good quality shoes and very warm. However I need to wear light socks with the shoes. If I wear heavy socks, shoes are a little tight and my feet get very hot. This is not a complaint but, my own reality. I\u2019m Six months into them and very pleased with them.", "I've worn Merrell footwear for several years. The quality is consistently high. These waterproof hiking boots are a bit tighter than my breathable Moab hiking shoes, both in length and width, but not uncomfortably so. If you are borderline on length or width you might want to go a half size longer or the w width, respectively. Overall, my satisfaction with Merrell remains constant: high quality, great value.", "WOWED BY THIS BOOT!! I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s a great comfortable fit!! I\u2019m really impressed by the out of the box comfort as I don\u2019t want to take them off.", "Every couple of years I replace my husband's boots. They change the style a little but the fit, comfort a wear stay the same. He loves them (trust me, he would tell me if he didn't!!)", "My biggest concern going from trail sneakers to hiking boots was the weight, but these do not weigh that much more and I haven't had a problem. They fit well, they are waterproof so far as I've tested them (shallow creeks, puddles, mud), and they are comfortable. They stay tight, I haven't had to re-tie them ever on a hike and they stay tight on my foot so I don't have any rubbing or abrasions. They are stiff, but give enough to be comfortable, they have good grip and all the seams appear tight and professional. Loving them.", "Solid, grippy outsole. Laces snug and comfortable out of the box. Sturdy but light enough to not wear you down (It feels like I could go running in these without much of an issue). Insole has solid arch support and enough room to add your own custom insoles if you\u2019d like. Have not tested the waterproofing too much as of yet, but they\u2019ve stayed dry through rain and puddles. My only complaint is the lack of a rock plate in the sole - you can definitely feel what\u2019s underfoot - otherwise these would be perfect hikers.", "This is my first pair of Merrill shoes, but I can see adding more to the collection. Only had them for a few weeks and they are perfect for my everyday use when weather calls for it.", "love these boots. had another pair many years ago and they are comfortable and VERY durable. my wife just ordered a new pair for me for my birthday and I'm very excited to replace my cheap walmart boots that I've been using more recently.", "I\u2019ve never owned Merrill\u2019s before, but had to find a sub since Timberland\u2019s products are not what they used to be. These boots fit like a glove and required no break or n period. A great boot for the price, or so it seems initially.", "I wear these primarily for fishing in temps over 45 degrees. They are waterproof even if I step in the lake trailering or launching my boat, or if it rains all day while I am in the boat.", "Been wearing it for about a month to test and ready them for the trails. So far, very comfortable even with regular socks, no liner or cushion wool socks for the time. Impressed with the fit.", "These hiking boots fit good but the fact that they are waterproof poses a problem with sweating feet. I bought a second pair which were not waterproof and like them much better and they had a lower price.", "I have wide feet so I ordered the wide size. They fit great. Feel awesome and seem rugged so far. These are my first high top Merrells but they are just as comfortable as the lows on my ankles.", "Very comfortable right out the box. No break-in required. Wore my usual wool hiking socks and kept my feet dry. The boots look bigger than expected when I opened the box but feel light and fit as expected. I was not able to test water-proof performance since the trail is dry. Traction on the downhill trail was good. My left foot lost footing on the downhill but ankle support prevented twisting my ankle.", "The best boots ever. My sons second pair. They have such great support. He loves them. Waterproofing is the best and they don't hurt his feet. He has no arches and his feet hurt all the time but not when he wears these boots. They are his favorite. They really have great tread perfect for work and for the outdoors.", "This is my third pair of essentially the same type of boot from Merrell. Just plain wore out the previous ones and needed replacement. Note this wearout did not happen quickly, but after long service life. Guess I'm a fan if I'm sticking with these so long. The only thing that wore out on these is the tread on the soles. Can't wear slicks in upper midwest ice and snow in the winters!", "I wear these boots everyday. They fit great and are very comfortable. I've only had them for a little bit over a month, so I can't really rate durability yet. I would recommend these boots based on the way they have worked out for me so far.", "I really love these shoes. They are great for hiking, working in the yard, or just wearing as normal shoes. Keep my feet nice and dry. The sole is thick and sturdy and the grip is very good. They took around 2 long hikes to break in, but now they are fantastic. Had them for around 6 months and no sign of wear and tear yet (and I wear them a lot).", "Did a search for hiking boots, and this was one of the brands that came up. I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. They are sturdy, offer good ankle support, and have great traction. Many hiking boots I've seen in the past were not much to look at, but these look great, which is an added bonus!", "These are just great shoes. My husband is on about his 5th pair over the years. Tried a pair of Keens a few months ago & returned and while nice enough, the fit just wasn't the same.", "These boots fit perfectly right out of the box. The first time I used them was two weeks ago on a moderately strenuous hike in the Eastern Sierra, in the Little Lakes Valley. Twelve miles and perhaps a thousand or so vertical feet later, the boots were still comfortable. Notably, the waterproof aspect is excellent. A couple of creek crossings required hiking through running water, and not a drop got inside these boots. I could see the water roll right off the Merrells when I pulled them out of the creeks. I can't wait to hike in them again!", "These boots are superb. they fit as expected and actually keep my feet warm (which is usually hard to do). This is my second pair just like these. NOTHING wrong with the first pair..still wearing daily. These bought just in case they stop making this style so I would have another pair available! Love them, love the brand", "Several years ago I was gifted a pair of Merrell hiking shoes and I haven't felt the need to buy another brand since. They are the only pair of shoes I've found with both a wide enough base to properly support my feet and sturdy enough material to prevent frequent wear and tear, especially since my feet tend to roll outwards. The price may seem steep, but the shoes last for years. Well worth it.", "Wore these on 2,300 Km hike. Had blisters and lost two toenails. Never could get shoes to feel right. I gave them plenty of time to break in and it still did not help. Shoe expert later told me Merrell hiking boots are not good for long hikes.", "I had carpal tunnel years ago and Merrell's were the only shoe that left me able to walk at the end of the day. Jump 10 years forward to today and they're what I wear on a day to day basis. My last pair lasted 2 years, so I was happy to get another. These ones seemed like they fit even better, look great and I look forward to spending time in them on the trail and in the office.", "Ordered the Moab 2 in a men\u2019s 9 medium . I already have a pair of Moab 2 purchased about a year and a half ago that fit great. The new ones are noticeably smaller even though the same size. Unfortunately since they were the same size as the pair I already have I went ahead and wore them on a hike getting them dirty and now I assume they are not returnable. Disappointed with Merrill .", "Out of the box perfect fit. First 6 mile hike at 9000ft no problem. Hike with my GSD through a stream and mud, forget about it. Fibram soles for grip on the rocks and scree great. Just buy them already.", "These boots are incredibly comfortable. Only boot I wear. Do yourself a favor and take out the insoles they come with, and replace them with the grey work insoles from Walmart", "I walk 10-12 miles per day, extremely comfortable comfortable boot. If you're planning on wearing an extra heavy sock, probably a good idea to go a half size up. Waterproofing definitely has a life, i recommend getting a Waterproofing spray.", "Fantastic boots. Worn these in very austere environments, through all sorts of weather, heat, hard rain, snow... they\u2019ve never let me down. I own two pairs and would highly recommend these boots to anyone looking for a very versatile, durable, and comfortable pair of boots.", "Bought a 9.5 wide. Fit great for old feet. Plenty of toe room. Was able to use thick socks and still felt good. Very light. I have had 9.5 Keene's that were to tight to wear with normal socks. Had to wear thin nylon and trim the front of the insole to get toe room. Didn't have to do anything with these Merrell's. They are just right.", "I buy these shoes as a daily wear item. The soles do wear down but I am in them anywhere from 10 to 12 hours a day, and I may travel over all kinds of surfaces (gravel, asphalt, steel, carpet, wood, etc.) I with they would last longer, but a year of constant use and wear is about par for me with any shoes, and some have not made it that long.", "These are great for light/medium duty work boots. I have owned Merrell shoes/boots for 20 plus years and have yet to legitimately wear a pair out. They are EXCELLENT quality, no matter what you buy.", "After a month of wear, the boots are taking on water. They\u2019re still comfortable, but I spent a little extra money versus the Mid Vent version and now they\u2019re not waterproof at all.", "I love the shoes! I bought a size 10, but the toe box was too small and cramped my toes, so I bought another pair at 10.5 and they fit just fine. My girlfriend had the same occurrence with her Moabs in size 5.5 and had to go with size 6. Buy a half size larger for great comfort in a well made hiker.", "Great boots and comfortable out of the box. Ordered size 11.5 but it was too small. Returned for a size 12 and they fit great with room for thick socks. I suggest 1/2 size larger than normal shoe size. Very warm gortex boot. May not be the best for summer use if you have hot sweaty feet. Will test how waterproof they are soon.", "Narrow toe box. A warm-weather shoe with vents down to the top of the sole, which could be susceptible to cactus spines. I bought this in 13EE at the same time as a Targhee II in 14M. The soles are the exact same length and have the same width at mid-sole. The toe box on the Targhee is quite a bit wider and more comfortable. This one is going back.", "Perfect fit order 10.5 wide. Extremely comfortable no break in needed.", "I am a size 12-12.5\". These are size 12. These boots are nice, but I should have gone the next size up. Quality construction and not too heavy. Live in Chicago area and they keep me plenty warm.", "So comfortable that I want to wear them when I\u2019m not hiking or trekking.", "Think I may have bought a bit wide, but snitched up they are excellent and stylish. And where I live and work, everyone wears Merrells. Now I know why.", "They fit well, they're comfortable, and most surprisingly, they're truly waterproof. I've walked through many streams in these with water coming up to just below the tops of the boots, and my feet have always stayed completely dry. Great boots.", "I tried around 6 other pairs of boots, but these were definitely the most versatile. They didnt make my feet appear to be canoes, so my maneuverability is fine. They are *mostly* waterproof, and very comfortable. I use these all the time now.", "Seems like it would have been a decent boot, but it is too small. I've worn 10.5 since I was a teen, all my footwear is currently 10.5, but these my to was touching the nose of the boot and it seemed narrow, I don't have a wide foot at all.", "My son loves these. I got them as a recommendation from a long time shoe salesman. I don\u2019t regret it one bit. My son has begun wearing these as his everyday shoe! I will be ordering again! Please MERRILL don\u2019t stop making these!", "the toebox is severely restricted. Much too small. This is the replacement for the J24749 style but does not match the quality.", "Bought these for hiking. Last weekend went up to 2000 m on a weather around freezing. Kept my feet dry, even if snow was melting and dripping from trees. Warmth was not a problem with regular compression socks but I had a pair of wool socks handy just in case. These run a bit small but after a few weeks are ok. Next time probably I will go half size up. Note for Merrel: Toebox can be improved for comfort with some padding.", "Great shoes for the price. I bought the same pair more than 10 years ago and now it was time to replace them. No need to look for something different. They are what I need: comfortable, durable, and stylish. I will buy them again!", "I wear a mens 8.5 for all boots. These 8.5's were far too tight. Amazon was efficient and fast with my refund and I am now very impressed with these size 9 boots. However, they ARE NOT waterproof. Water resistant at the most :)", "Perfect fit and still supportive beneath my feet and around my ankles. Haven't hiked on anything near deadly, but I've put them through rain and snow, and these boots have proved durable and look nearly as good as when I got them. My only quibble is the rate at which the boots sometime take in water or snow. Just waterproof enough to give me some time to escape, but could be better. Edit [18 Feb 2020]: Still wear these boots regularly, and they're still very comfortable. Hardly any damage despite me wearing them through two winters here in Aomori Japan. If you see me in the snow, I'm definitely wearing these boots.", "2 days after the end of the return date, and after my 6th time wearing them, the top lace came off... Getting a replacement is ridiculously aggravating ... Especially when they don't answer tour emails !!", "The fit is somewhat smashed on the toe angle, ankle support is good though. Not too much to complain about, haven\u2019t had to walk through too much water yet, so no opinion on the water proofing.", "Good looking hiking shoes that are waterproof, comfortable, and solid traction. This is my second set of Merrell boots. I, also, have the Moad 2 Airvent which are lighter and comfortable for summer hiking. With these being waterproof they are excellent for cooler wet weather hikes.", "the first couple hours these boots were comfortable, as the day went on, I had sore feet.", "I like these, they provide a great grip on the ground, and they are a stable platform when hiking over rocks and tree limbs. However they are noticeably heavy and take a LONG time to wear in. I cannot walk more than 3 miles in these still. Wear them around the house for a good long time before taking them on the trail.", "Warm, comfortable. Wear it as fall/winter/spring street boots. Bought these to replace older MOABs - one concern I have is whether these will develop a hole on the inside back wall like my MOABs did, but I am trying to prevent by putting these on carefully and not just yanking them on.", "Hubby has very wide foot. Usually needs a hard to find 3E or 4E 8.5. Thought we\u2019d give these a try since the Merrell boots I wear have a nice roomy toe box in just a regular width. Hubby loves them! They fit perfect!", "Look great, feel great, and perform great! This is the only brand of hiking shoes/boots I've work for over 10 years now...no reason to switch.", "This is my 2nd pair of these. I bought them as a replacement for the 1st pair when they finally wear out. I'm still hiking in the 1st pair. One issue: the sole very recently began to separate on both sides of the toe box on both shoes. This isn't terribly odd on glued soles. I'm pretty hard on hiking boots. I bought a can of BARGE cement to repair this and its held without failing. Link to the cement:", "These are just what i wanted. FIt and support. Supposedly water proof. I'm glad i bought them. Since my feet are hard to fit shoes and boots, I am thinking of buying another pair.", "Nice lightweight, durable and comfortable. Waterproofing could have been better but overall great hiking boots to hike in the Rocky Mountains.", "Color was supposed to be a light tan. Instead it was sort of silver. The upper sides come to the middle of my ankle which is uncomfortable. Also, the shoe strings aren't long enough.", "These shoes are extremely comfortable and fit as expected. I have purchased these in several colors and boot and shoe style. Have enjoyed them and will order more as needed. I am on my feet a lot and these are my favorite.", "These shoes are comfortable and correctly sized. I have been through several pairs of merrell boots before and felt comfortable ordering them online. I haven't gotten the high tops before but these seem ok. They do not last very long anymore but that has been my experience with most shoes. The only one's that last longer are red wings. They're 3 years old and haven't even broken in yet.", "My husband loves these. His go to shoes are New Balance sneakers so he has to be reminded that he has these. He loves wearing them. Great for snow and hiking.", "Sometimes I find the Merrill products to run a bit small but these were spot on straight out of the box. I love that they feel broken in almost immediately. I love these boots.", "I ordered a half size bigger to for a long hiking trip so my feet would have room per a friend that\u2019s said to because your feet will swell Only thing they get hot but I\u2019m in Texas probably better in winter. I shall see", "Great boot. Used to hike in Monument Valley, Antelope Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and Zion. Didn\u2019t have to break them in. No foot problems. Definitely waterproof. Fits great. I have a wider foot and can\u2019t wear Nikes, but these fit awesome. Recommend getting some elastic laces to go with. The laces with these are long.", "I ordered a half size up from my usual size and they fit perfectly. Maybe my feet grew. I have only worn them around local to break in, planning a hike soon, that will be test.", "Like all the reviewers are saying these shoes are not what they used to be. The souls are starting to fall off these boots already in less then a week...Iv worn them arnd the house and played one round golf in them. Returning them", "Perfect fit. Tried on same size but standard width in store. They didn\u2019t carry the wide. Ordered these and saved $45 over store price.", "Very comfortable. After a couple of miles hikes I noticed that the sole was coming off. I contacted the seller which they emailed me a form to fill out along with pictures and they replaced them within a week. New boots came and I have had no problems with new ones. Great boots and even better customer service.", "These are the perfect mix of support and comfort. They are very capable hikers, but in addition, they've become my go-to for stuff like running out to the store. Absolutely worth the money.", "I bought these for my husband for a hiking trip to Colorado. They came about two weeks before we left and as soon as he put them on he said, \"These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned!\" He wears them everyday now. I will definitely be buying him another pair whenever he wears these out.", "These are the Best I have ever had since I gave up on my Justin Boots after 30 years hard to find a Great shoe in today's world. You hardly tell you have any shoes on Great fit and looks for any Occasion. I now have several pairs, To work in, Fish and Hunt in, And go out in. Not to mention the knees and back dont ache as much These Days", "Great look and feel...at first. Are NOT waterproof as advertised. Wore them for three days while pressure washing and they killed my feet and soaked them to the bone! Now they\u2019re just sitting in my closet collecting DUST! VERY EXPENSIVE PAPER WEIGHT!", "The boot has a nice fit, and I like the looks of it, seems very functional. The one problem I had was it was hot on my feet. Only after wearing them for 5-10 minutes in the house, my feet were burning up. This would be good in cold weather, but I'm wearing them inside more as a work boot.", "I purchased these boots specifically for a 10 day trip to Iceland. I wore them for about 12 hours each day during the entire trip, and they were more comfortable than my regular tennis shoes. I can't speak to the long-term durability or waterproof performance of these boots. I can say that I was completely pleased with their performance and was very happy with my decision to purchase this specific boot.", "The shoe that arrived is different from the picture. The tab on the shoe in the picture is labeled Mdry. The tab on the shoe that arrived is labeled waterproof. Also, the color in the picture is different from the shoe that arrived.", "I've been using Merrell shoes for several years - on my fourth pair. Started going on Winter hikes this year, and needed something comfortable and waterproof in a high top. Tried these out on a five mile hike yesterday, and they were great on a strenuous trail. Very study and comfortable. Love the way the boot top is slanted to the back - makes it easier to put on.", "Bought this for my husband\u2019s trip to rainy Alaska. He said it was tight for the first couple of days but a couple of weeks he likes the boots.", "I've had these shoes for a month and wear them most days on my hikes. The left shoe is great but the sole of the right shoe has issues. I feel bumps even when standing on flat ground.", "I bought these boots after reading the solid reviews for a 4 day trek in the Inca trail in Peru. I was so busy before the trip I didn't have a chance to break them in so I was a bit worried it'd be an issue. Very quickly I realized it would be no problem. They were so comfortable I nearly forgot they were brand new. I used Merino wool socks for the entire journey so that may have played a role. Regardless I am fully confident that they'll perform like champs on my upcoming 14 day trek to Nepal.", "Very comfortable and seems to be well built. My only caution is that these are made to be waterproof, therefore they don\u2019t breathe. Expect hot and sweaty feet if you wear them indoors.", "Bought these for my son who was working in landscaping. He loved them because they kept his feet dry when it was wet and warm when it was cold. He said they were the most comfortable shoe for working outside.", "This is my second pair of these boots and needless to say but the first pair was so good I purchased the same boot again...", "Very comfortable and warm hikers. Good traction and flexibilityUse for walking the dog on various surfaces from snow covered to pavement. Would have given 5 stars, but laces keep coming untied unless double knotted.", "Pros: survived lot of difficult and long hikes in last 15 days. Stayed waterproof until the water was below the top of the show. Good grip on snow as well. Did not get any blisters even on an 8 mile difficult (rated by alltrails) hike. Because it is waterproof, it becomes hot though you might not wanna wear it on a normal day.", "My first pair had a bit over 900 miles ! I love my new ones I fast walk an average of 3 miles per Day ! Very comfortable ! ... O", "These boots are made solid, has great arch support, and super light weight. I'm expecting to have these for a long time.", "Full disclosure: I have yet to actually \"hike\" in these shoes, but I have worn them around at work and just going about. They are extremely comfortable; more so than any other shoe I've ever worn.", "Two weeks after getting these I went hiking in the mountains of Colorado. A few weeks after that hiking through mud puddles in a forest during a torrential downpour. They live up to their name.", "Was a gift. Bought 2 different pair of Merrels. He says this Moab was so comfortable, it felt like it was \"worn in\" already. Loved them. It's the 3rd pair of this brand. Happy!", "I had to return and get a half size bigger (bigger than Nike,vans, and dockers). Super comfortable biggest hike has been 10 miles with 3k in elevation. About 60 miles on them and I\u2019m very happy", "I wore these all over Iceland and they did a great job. I used them to climb (very lightly) on lava rock, climbing wet stairs and walking some very long distances. They kept my feet cool, always had a good grip. Even when I scuffed them over rocks, they never kept a mark on the shoe. Great shoe, and I will likely buy it again.", "you can buy these cheep made shoes any were for 30 bucks they run 1/2 size too small and will hurt your feet and im not on my feet all day! junk! dont waste your money! yuk!", "I wear orthotics and finding the right shoe is always a challenge. I have worn New Balance 9 1/2 EE for years, this 9 1/2 wide by Merrell is perfect! No breaking in time either, just comfortable from day one", "This is the fourth pair of these boots I have bought. I work in construction and I\u2019m on the move all day. Out of the box fit no break in required. My feet stay dry and comfortable all day. They last me around 8-12 months before the wear out. Highly recommended if you want a comfortable boot that will hold up to everyday wear and tear", "I love these boots. The were comfortable right out of the box, and I've been wearing them everywhere, not just hiking. I haven't REALLY tested their waterproofness, but I've walked a mile or so in the rain, and my feet were still dry at the end.", "I specifically sought out Merrell Moab 2 footwear to replace my last pair that had a lot of miles on them. I was hoping for comfort and was not disappointed. I love the earth tone look and the fit is right on. My feet were so comfortable I had to double check to make sure but \u201cThose aren\u2019t pillows!\u201d", "My favorite go to shoe for most any occasion. Supportive for your ankles, i suffer from plantar fasciitis ao i had to add a insert for arch support. Best shoe for the money", "Used these shoes to traverse Japan for a Month which of course include some mountain climbing. They are very comfortable, and I found them to be quite durable. The only fault that occurred with them was the blister that formed on my right lateral side of the foot which made wearing them a bit more difficult. Good shoes for longer hikes, but not perfect.", "All good. I have always had merrells. Super happy with them in general. However, this is absolutely NOT waterproof. My toes were wet walking over grass with dew on them. I plan to spray water repellant on it.", "Order a size larger if you have a wide foot. Water proof and very comfortable. I walk 12-15 miles in a shift as a K9 handler for a Carferry and they are awesome.", "Bought these prior to a trip to Colorado. Only wore them one day before the trip to break them in a little, but man, they were so comfortable. We probably hiked over 40 miles and my feet were fine. Highly recommended!", "Absolutely love these! Super comfy, can't wait to hit the trails. Great for walking about town to, would highly recommend to anyone!", "I got the grey us9.5 men\u2019s version. Very comfortable hiking mid hi boot. Lots of toe room and bit feels light as a feather. Tread held up good in the mud. Decent ankle support. My entire foot feels supported and it doesn\u2019t allow my foot to slide which would cause blisters. I have a high arch, and somewhat wide foot. This hiking boot fits amazingly well.", "This is my 2nd pair of these. Very durable. No problems with stitching or adhesives after 6 months of heavy use (abuse) on the 1st pair. They\u2019re just not as pretty now, lol, and have lost waterproofness. Very comfortable right out of the box, with excellent support.", "Bought these for my husband who wears an 8.5, they fit him perfectly. He loves this style of Merrell's and they give him great support for his high arches. This is his second pair of Merrell's in this style hiking boot.", "If I could rate these 6 stars I would. These are the best boots I've ever owned. I'll come home from work and change out of my work shoes into these boots before I take my dog for a walk. They are great for hiking and are more comfortable than my running shoes. Would buy again.", "Went for a few 10+ mile hikes with no issues, the waterproofing is incredible and has made walking through streams great!", "They are excellent boots, I love them, but be aware of the fact that they run small. I had to return them twice to accommodate my feet to the right size; try with a whole number larger than the one you normally wear,for instance if you wear 10 buy an 11 instead of a 10.5. Overall opinion: they are very good and very comfortable boots.", "I bought these as a replacement to some Vasque boots I purchased that were just too narrow and uncomfortable. So far these fit well and are very warm. I have not had a chance yet to test their waterproof-ness.", "This boot was very comfortable right out of the box. So for I am very happy with the purchase and the value.", "The boots look really good. It feels like the arch support is further back than it should be. I just got them today. I'm gonna wear them around the house for a few days and see how they feel. The size is right on. They feel good other than the weird arch support position.", "I've had Merrel's before and was extremely satisfied. I bought this pair to replace them but was disappointed as soon as I stepped in a puddle. My feet were immediately wet. The shoes fit well enough and are comfortable, but they are definitely not waterproof. A short walk through the morning dew is enough to get your feet wet. I use them now for work boots around the yard or short hikes on a dry trail.", "Despite the heat build up, I'd still buy these again. However, the price has me searching for alternatives.", "To date I have 12 pair of various Merrill shoes and boots. Some are over 20 yrs old. I love em, I need em, I will own em!", "I bought these for a trip to Zion NP and they were exactly what I needed. I used these in the most strenuous hikes (Observation Point and The Subway) and they were perfect. My feet felt supported and comfortable despite the fact that I wore them for at least eight hours each day. I would highly recommend them.", "Merrell\u2019s are one of the most comfortable boots out of the box I have ever worn. I think that is why I keep buying them. Also they are very durable and cool to wear.", "The good thing is they have wide sizes and they are waterproof/water resistant. I've only worn these boots for a few months and one of the loops have already ripped off. Not sure if other people ran into this issue or not but I expected them to last longer than 6 month before something went wrong with them.", "I've been buying Merrells for years now and have always been happy with their shoes. These Moab 2 Mid are great, I have to always get a wide size to be comfortable and some styles don't come in wide. I would recommend these shoes to any one who has to have a wide size. Comfortable right out of the box.", "I just wrote a negative review concerning my MOAB 2 mid hiking boot; however, I just spoke with representative and they have a new pair of boots on the way. As stated, I have owned several pair of these boots and never had a problem with sole coming apart. I still have problem with toe cap; however, with the amount of crawling I do, I cannot expect toe cap to stay on much longer than the 8 months I referenced.", "Great boots! I wore them for the first time just yesterday on a hike in the North Georgia mountains. I completely forgot that I was supposed to be breaking in new boots. It felt like I had been wearing them for years. I recommend going up a half size from what you wear in a tennis shoe to account for thick hiking socks.", "Worn daily for 5 months 8 to 10 hours a day. Worn in wet/cold/dry/hot conditions here's what I've found: Waterproofing is fine, unless you submerse the boot - go figure. Fit is narrow. I have narrow feet which would have been otherwise perfect, however the toe space is very tight and therefore my feet hurt and I can no longer wear the boots. Found them to be light weight and fairly durable - some stitching on one boot -about an inch- just behind the rubber toe guard on the on the outside of the boot, came unraveled at 4 months.", "Just breaking them in now. Fit very well and look sturdy. Last pair of Merrill boots lasted my sixteen years so I expect good things from this pair.", "Good price. They fit well. Break in was fairly quick. On my second walk around our neighborhood they seemed very comfortable.", "I give these one star as they are 6 months old and leak. Waterproof to me means just that. They have begun leaking were the sole attaches to the upper. I like Merrells but don\u2019t buy these! I use them for daily walks", "These shoes work good hiking with light to moderate loads. Good support and one of the few pairs of shoes that have fit my 3E feet.", "Great shoes and support. I have the low cut version too. When I will be on my feet all day, I like the added ankle support.", "These boots feel great, but they are not water proof at all. This morning I walked through short grass with dew on it. The grass was just tall enough to get the toe wet, yet the water went straight through to soak my socks on both feet.", "These shoes are very comfortable and seem to be good quality. The toe box was a bit narrow, and I would say arch support is slightly below average.", "Ordered my regular size 10.5 and had to return and replaced with Size 11. These Merrill\u2019s are awesome. I\u2019ve been wearing Merrell\u2019s for many years because they are very comfortable and last.", "I bought these and went hiking in Colorado. They were warm and kept my feet dry all day. True to Merrell's reputation.", "I bought these to replace a similar pair. The only issue I have is that the soles are slippery on some (smooth) surfaces - compared to my older ones, which were not slippery.", "Great shoe. Good quality. I'm still wearing the pair I bought 3 years ago. I wear it every day. Just starting to show wear so decided to get another.", "Fits great in the wide width I got. The shoe is sturdy yet very light. I am very happy with the quality of the shoe. I have worn it in snow, walking through water and in summer treks. The shoe doesn't get wet (I didn't plunge my foot in deep water but just walking through puddles and slushy snow) yet it also breathes well so your foot doesn't sweat in hot weather.", "Great fitting boot, however there are quality control issues. Right boot laces are longer that the left boot... i didn't notice it until a few days later. Annoying that these are brand new and came like this. Tried to call customer service, was on hold for over 30 min, waste of time", "Hike National Parks every year over some very rugged terrain. I am on my fourth pair of Merrells, and they all are still in service. I'm sure there are other good hikers out there, but why try something else when I know how good the Moabs are, and the fit on them is perfect everytime. Highly recommended product.", "Made in Vietnam, another Communist sweat shop country where the big corporations can take advantage of poor people. I know these people because I was there many years ago. Certainly not worth $100.00. Had to replace the insoles out of the box. Won\u2019t stay tied, l might get a couple months out of them before the garbage man takes them away. Don\u2019t deserve one star !!\u2019", "Wore them right out of the box, had to size up half a size. But, then they were perfect! Ready for my Iceland trip.", "Snug fit with excellent support. I wish I would have gone with a half size larger. They are still doable.", "This was a replacement pair of boots because I wore holes in the previous pair. The sides on the previous pair almost came to the middle of the shoe. This time they are lower which makes the tongue more visible. Otherwise, this boot fits me like a glove. I will buy these again.", "These boots were $40 more at a major sports store. Literally the same exact boot. My fiance\u0301 loves this particular style. There\u2019s no reason to pay a higher price!", "Had been wearing these for a few weeks for work and hiked for a few times. It\u2019s really comfortable and fit just right with my feet. Works perfect and protects my ankle.", "Worst pair of hiking boots I've ever bought. Even after breaking them in still terrible. I rarely if ever write reviews for products, but for this one it deserves a warning for prospective buyers. DO NOT BUY THESE BOOTS!", "I bought the next size up after reading an answer to a question on here. At first I was afraid they were too big. However, they've been getting lots of use lately. I recently climbed a mountain (16 miles) and they were great. I'm still not sure if I would have been better off with a size smaller though. Otherwise, good hiking boots.", "Bought theses 10 months ago as a back up ( I love Merrell MOAB fit). Just broke them out a week ago, today I walked in heavy rain and toes leaked. Of course it's too late to return them.", "I have medium to slightly narrow feet and these boots were a great fit. I havent hiked yet but they are light weight and comfortable. I measure 81/2 and usualy wear size 9 in hiking boots and running shoes and these were spot on.", "Love them and they are used inside and outside everyday. I can't complain on concrete floors and in the dirt. My favorite hiking shoes! Keep up the Quality, and I will continue to buy the rest of my life!", "Comfortable! Seens like good qaulity so far. Really like them. To me it feels alittle tight. Won't be able to wear my thick socks in winter with these, like my other Merrell shoes.", "Do not buy these boots. They fell apart on me during the first hike. Poor support and grip on the sole as well. I enjoy Merrell typically so this was disappointing", "These shoes are incredible. Extremely comfortable, great ankle support, waterproof up to the top of the shoe, and great traction. They also look great. One thing I will mention is it you get in the water like I do while hiking, because of the waterproof design they retain water on the inside very well. Make sure you dry them really well on the inside as soon as you are done.", "I've always wanted a pair of these shoes. My feet don't allow me to purchase shoes on-line, however, I must admit, these fit my feet fine.", "Nice boot. Very light. When I picked up the box, I thought it might not be full! The boots look and feel great. If I would quibble, is that there was no \"extra-wide\" option. All-in-all, a great boot!", "They weren't as comfortable as I thought they would be, especially for the price. I ended up having to put insoles in the boot to make them more comfortable. I was a bit disappointed in them.", "When it comes to a solid; incredible comfortable hiking or work shoe/boot; Merrill is THE best I have owned", "I have been a Wolverine man for 30 years. Thus far, and it has only been a week, this is the best boot I have ever owned. Light and comfortable. I bought it based on its' reputation. Looks solid, but I am tough on boots. Hope it holds together. So far, so good", "Very satisfied. They are very light (not heavy) and comfortable (I have the wide nose type).", "Bought these boots for all around use. Spent a week walking around Disney parks in these and have had them in the woods and at work for a few months. They fit very well and are holding up to moderate abuse. My only complaint is that my feet sweat a little. But I\u2019ve yet to find waterproof boots that don\u2019t make me sweat. Overall they are very comfortable. I would definitely recommend them", "My husband plays disc golf which is a lot of hiking and walking. He said these shoes are ultra water proof. The only thing I dislike about them is that they're like cleats and seem to tracking so much dirt whenever he comes home from being outside all day. I mean, a crazy amount of dirt!", "I ordered my standard size I had with other Merrell products, these rubbed on the top of my foot behind my toes. Purchased these ahead of a trip I was going on and was disappointed with them. Purchased Merrell in the past and experienced great performance of products that have performed with great comfort and wear.", "I have wide feet. I\u2019ve been wearing Merrill\u2019s for a long time, this is my first higher riding. The arch support is better than the low cut ones and the shoe is of great quality for the price. I\u2019ll probably get these as long as they keep making them.", "They fit perfectly and are very comfortable for long hikes. They are breaking in nicely!", "Merrill makes a great boot. I haven't had them in any harsh conditions, but expect them to perform. So far lots of wear for walking and a little hiking and work perfect. They can get a little warm in hot weather so picking the right sock is important, but after all they are boots, not flip flops.", "My 2nd pair of these. I usually wear a 4e shoe and the width is perfect...love them.", "Product arrived quickly. Shoes were as advertised. Good quality build. I'm happy with this purchase.", "These are NOT waterproof. Toes get wet when walking dog in wet grass. Waste of money. Vasque Breeze for over ten years, read poor reviews and tried another brand. Oboz Bridger are waterproof. Not these boots.", "Love the look of these but they run too small. I take a 14 in most other shoes and these would kill my toes. I'm sad to return them because they don't come in a 15", "Most comfortable shoes ever. Will buy another pair soon\ud83d\ude09 Correction one month later heal is coming apart... Got a hold of customer service Mathieu took all my information told me he'd get right back via email .... Still waiting what a joke. I guess customer service is as good as the sole of your second rate shoe.... Sad I already purchased a pair for my wife.\ud83d\ude21", "Needed to add a separate soul support, but these are really comfortable wear.

Spoke with someone at Merrell shoes. They said that they would take care of the situation. Replace shoes with another pair. HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM MERREL SHOES AT ALL!!!!", "This is the 3rd pair of these I have bought. They last me about 5-6 years. Very good value.", "Two weeks with them. They feel like a pair of sneakers. Very light and comfortable from the box. No need to break them in. Time will tell about durability and how water proof they are. As it right now they are a great purchase for the money.", "Have been through 8 or 9 pairs of these shoes over the last 6 years. Was wearing Northface Storms and there is no comparison.", "My second pair of these after wearing out the first set, comfy, require very little break in, have not ventured out in heavy rain yet. Thanks Amazon for offering choice that we don't always get in Oz.", "I liked the ability to exchange a poor fitting shoe for a good fitting shoe size.", "Unfortunately the standard width is a little too narrow and the wide width is a little too wide, otherwise pretty good shoes.", "Just got a pair and they are about a half size too small. I have worn a size 9 US for decades. Got these in a 9 and my big toe bumps the end. Too tight for hiking for me. Based on only wearing them for a few minutes, they look and feel great. I have 5 stars but have little to go on beyond first impression. Just wanted to warn that they run small.", "I hike over some very rough terrain and these boots protect my feet really well.", "These boots are for my son and despite returning the first pair and now returning the second pair is not a reflection of the boot. They are a good boot and my son really likes the look, color and that fact that they are waterproof. My son is very picky so we are returning the second pair and I will turn around and order the 3rd pair this time in a wide. The seller has been very good about the returns and I always request an Amazon gift card when I know that we are re-ordering.", "The shoes exceeded my expectations for a good fit which is usually a problem for me. They were comfortable from the get go!", "Stylish design, and quality construction in a comfortable fit. Good traction on first trail use (dry conditions). Laces could be a few inches longer, however they may stretch over time. As they are, just long enough to double knot at the top lace hook. I expect these boots will last a long time with moderate use.", "Quality shoe but they run narrow. Wish I had ordered one size up from my normal shoe size.", "Merrell boots are pretty much all I wear for hiking. As a woman with a wide foot and high instep, I have order women\u2019s wide (rare in Merrell \u2018s) or their men\u2019s boots. So, again I am happy with this purchase. I haven\u2019t worn them yet to test waterproof, because the winter season is over here.", "Walked in them for a month in East Africa photoSafariing animals. No problems", "I own Merrell sandles and water shoes. So might as well get boots for hiking. They are the most comfortable hiking boots i have owned!", "Seems to perform OK, but I would advise that you order at least one size up.", "Gods gift to my feet. I have a bad ankle and other foot problems. While I only been wearing them for 24 hours I was able to take my brace off and my ankle feels amazing. I wear a size 12 EEEE and the size 12 EE fits well. I will update this if my opinion changes. So far they are awesome", "So disappointed in these boots. They are not waterproof at all. The 1st time we hiked and the grass was wet they soaked though. Would not recommend them", "The upper nylon shoe lace eyelet pulled loose after using the boot one time. It looks as if someone or something missed stitching that particular eyelet as I've had no problems with any of the other eyelets. This is otherwise a very nice boot. Very warm and comfortable. I would buy again, but would look at a different manufacturer if I encountered another problem the second time around.", "I ordered a size down. I am very pleased with this boot. It is literally more comfortable than ANY shoes I own. Just got them broken it. I did put Danner arch supports in.", "I had a pair of Merrill\u2019s that I\u2019ve worn for about 10 years and had finally worn out. Ordered these to replace them - great value, high quality, great fit. The only minor complaint is that the laces are a little short, probably end up picking up some slightly longer replacements at REi.", "Love Merrell and have 3 pair. These are a bit narrow for me but I have W feet. Wish they offered more W options because I love them. I'm going with a close competitor for my shoes only due to W issues. Love Merrell h and wish they catered to my wide foot", "Great boot a little tight but they break in quick love in AZ and seem to be a little warm we will see. Do allot of hiking and riding sxs's and so far better than average. Love them", "Very comfortable and light hiking boots! Might buy the low top version also!", "Hefty good winter boot. Fit was true. I ordered one size larger because I wear thick wool socks when steelhead fishing and hiking in snow. Love all the insulation around my ankles and the treads on the soles.", "I hike in these often. Seem very durable. Sizing runs small so go for at least a half size larger than normal.", "a good, light boot with great tread and fit like i like it. I have an extra wide foot and this boot is perfect. i get an extra sock on to fill a slight excess but otherwise it's warm and fits well.", "I\u2019ve always like these boots and now being able to order them online makes it even better!", "The shoes were fine but the insole was a size 10 whereas the size of the shoes was much smaller. The insole was forced into the smaller shoes. Planning to contact the seller regarding this issue.", "SIL loves these. Everything about them was perfect. It was a bday gift.", "1st pair was too small. Added next size up. Bought these for hiking. But I wear them daily. Returning and credit was as smooth as can be thanks to Amazon Prime!", "Great hiking boots! Fits true to size and were very comfortable. We have hiked one 14er with them straight out of the box and didn't receive any blisters. Fits great and love them!", "Great hiking boots. Not too heavy but good support. They run SMALL though. I am a size 12 and needed a 13 in this boot FYI", "As many reviews suggest, you need to go HALF (not a full size as some other reviews suggest) a sizer larger than your normal size. I am normally a 9.5 and got a 10. They fit perfectly (do they really though?).", "Good quality. My foot is not wide in any shoe, including Merrell\u2019s. I originally got a 10.5, my usual size, but it was too tight, small. Got 11, fits better, but still more tight in width than expected.", "Very comfortable all weather boot. Can easily wear these every day indoors and out.", "Hiked in very difficult terrain. My feet were so grateful for these boots. While others suffered, I felt great! I highly recommend these boots. Also, waterproof design worked perfectly. Many deep puddles were stepped in...but my socks and feet remained dry.", "like the look but there is little comfor t to speak of. Work plumbing construction and need a verstaile/comfortable shoe. if you're wearing thick socks, can help w comfort but wish there ws more built in, especially at toe box", "Very water resistant, almost waterproof. Keep my feet pretty dry except in the wettest conditions.", "Hiking Shoes are a bit undersized, but I knew that when ordering. I normally take a 9, but the 9 felt a bit tight, so I ordered 9 1/2 which are are roomy, but still comfortable. I need wide width and the wide size is perfect for me. Shoes were delivered to my neighbor by mistake, luckily he is honest and brought them to me.", "I thought Merrell had a good reputation for quality but I bought these boots in May and just yesterday, while lacing them up for a hike, the top lace loop pulled free from the shoe. The stitching gave way so I had to sew it back on and now wait to see if it works. Also, not waterproof as claimed. I advise avoiding these boots.", "These boots are high quality you get all the bang 4 ur buck 4 me I need 12.5 most of there boots are", "These replaced a heavily worn pair of the same. I got 4 years of hiking and frequent wear to work out of them.", "Ridiculous. I ordered a size 13. The box said size 13. In it was a size 10.5. I\u2019m not disappointed with the product.

These fit great, are comfortable and can support me all day with no issues", "I got a pair of these boots locally. I wear custom built orthotics that are rather thick and take up a lot of room in my shoes. The standard width works fine for me, so i don't know if it would be wide for the average user or not. I decided to buy another 'backup' pair and got them from Amazon and have been very happy.", "Like most Merrell hikers, fit great out of the box. Have hiked hundreds of miles in these boots, lightweight but sturdy enough.", "Used these for hunting in Wyoming. Tried them out ahead of time to make sure they felt right for my feet. No complaints. These are great boots.", "Shoes were for my husband Color and style great. Were comfortable right out of the box. He hard to fit feet so he tried on a pair of a similar style in a store. The shoes fit with hiking weight socks.", "Never had any problems with any Merrell that i have ever bought", "I do a lot of hiking in Oregon and these boots have excellent support and traction. The boot actually cradles my foot compared to others that I own. They are Merrell so I know they will not let me down and last for years.", "No surprise here; this is literally the 3rd exact pair purchased - model, size, and color. If it's not broke, don't fix it.", "I do alot of long distance hiking so you can imagine my shoes are one of my top priorities. Ive tried several other brands including name brand.

Have only worn 1 so hard to tell now.", "My husband loves Merrell Moab hikers. I buy him a new pair every year or two. They always fit the same and are super comfortable.

This is my second pair (original pair did not wear out. My feet went up a size)", "Lightweight durable hiking boot. Will give them the test in Kauai!", "The boats are great! I walk around the city a lot so i need comfortable boats I can walk in and that keep y feet dry. These boats are perfect for just that. The package came in very banged up.

So comfortable right out of the box. This is my third pair over the years.", "These are great shoes for backpacking. We backpacked 31 miles in two days and I had 0 blisters. I also accidentally dunked my feet up to the top laces while getting water and the inside of the shoes stayed completely dry. The boots don't breath as well as sneakers, but it was never unbearable, however, I did find I took them off any chance I had to dry and cool off my feet.", "regular was too right so I reordered wide, which seems too wide. I have a left foot that is fussy. But good feeling boot.", "As usual a great product. seems to do well it's my 2nd pair", "Little bit smaller than expected but great boots.

I have flat feet with some hardware in my feet from my time in the military and very picky with shoes but these work wonderfully.", "This is a great hiking shoe! We got the recommendation from my BIL who loves his pair. My husband just went for an overnight hike in them and he loves them. High weight but tons of traction for gripping the trail. Overall, I think he loved his birthday present \u2665\ufe0f", "Great. Logged many miles through mud and moist terrain without any complaints.", "These fit me great and are comfortable. I have not yet worn them on a hike, but they feel great on the walks I\u2019ve worn them on.", "I bought these to take to the snow. They kept my feet dry and protected. Traction is good on dirt and soft/loose snow. On hard ice they are a bit slippery, which was a given. Other than that I am satisfied with my new boots.", "Boots are great but they are hiking boots! Why would merrell design the shoelace loops to be flimsy fabric. You tighten the laces then after a couple months the fabrics lace holders always break!!! Horrible design", "Fake boots, Mdry emblem not present. I suspect that these boots are not even waterproof either.", "Been wearing every day since I received them just what", "Great boots, but if you have hot/sweating feet even in cold weather you may want to find something else. My feet sweat like they're in a sauna all day.", "I continue to buy and wear these shoes because they feel great and are good to go out the box. But they are NOT waterproof. Never have been, probably never will be. I will still keep buying them... and getting wet feet.", "These 11.5 wide merrells fit a little more snug than my previous set. Overall comfortable but maybe just need broke in. Old shoes lasted 3 years of use overseas in rough terrain.

Thanks for great service!", "I had to go a 1/2 size up, but after that I have to say this is the best boot I've ever had. Keeps your foot comfortable in both hot and cold external temps.

He always buys the same boots.", "First water in counter my feet were completely soaked. Keep in mind the shoes were still brand new about a few days new\ud83d\ude11 save your money.

The traction is also dramatically reduced on hard surfaces. The waterproofing has however held up wonderfully!", "Great fit and feel out of the box. Very good traction and stability on all terrain with decent waterproofing. On longer hikes especially on rocky terrain your feet will start to hurt due to a lack of cushioning in the sole. Also, the molding on mine started to come undone after just 10 hikes. If you are looking for more support and a more substantial boot I would suggest the Salomon Quest 4D, but if you want a super comfortable day hiking boot with a more sneaker like feel, the Merrel Moab II is a great option.", "Very nice boot for hiking. For some reason it pinches both my little toes.", "overall, I like these boots. I have hiked mountains and rough terrain, so far, have held up well.

There is fatigue that sets in over hours of walking. Taking the boots off for five minutes and changing socks helps. They are hot, and I will not wear them over the summer.", "my husband loves them! He has purchased several pairs of these for working as a mechanic", "Very comfortable and I am on my feet all day.", "This is my fourth pair of Merrill Moab Hikers in 6 years and they are just as reliable as the last 3 pairs. I wear them as a daily work shoe and they always perform as expected. They always keep my feet dry and provide comfort no matter the occasion.", "Just came back from a short hike with these boots and they were extremely comfortable. The only slight negative is the back of the boots are too firm out of the box, so they rub the top of my ankles. I'm sure after breaking in these boots, that won't be a problem.", "Love the shoe, runs small order a 1/2 size larger. Very comfortable.", "Great fit, all day, every day.

I returned the Mid Vent and ordered this Moab 2 and had the same problem, a large bulge in the toe of the right shoe, so had to also return it.

Gives great ankle support.", "The wide is a true wide. A no break in period. These boots are comfy right out of the box.", "I\u2019ve worn this brand,style and size for over 10 years. But they no longer fit me. I\u2019ll always try on in a store from now on.", "I have had an identical pair (except for color) for quite a few years and loved them. They were comfortable the first time I put them on my feet. When they wore out, I bought these.", "Just s little tight in the toe. Otherwise great boot", "I bought it for my son at first he said it felt tight but after he starts wamearing it it fits very good", "I bought these for a 3-day Grand Canyon hike, they were awesome. I bought a size bigger than I usually need, so I could wear a little thicker sock, and thicker inserts. Not one blister, not one complaint.", "So far love these shoes, fit just a bit tight, but not too bad as they will most likely stretch a bit after wearing for a while,better than being too large. Appear well made and very comfortable, no break in required. Good price on Amazon as well.", "I actually need to return these, as I tried them on for the first time today, and the rivet came out of the top lace hook, the first time they were laced up. Very disappointed, as I\u2019ve always had great luck with Merrell products.", "These are almost perfect. They are very hot and cause more sweat and heat than I've experienced with any other shoe. I was also hoping for a slightly taller heel, but they're still very good. Great traction on rocks and snow.

I would recommend a hiking shoe however unless you need the added ankle support or walking through tall grass.", "I have a pair of these that are about seven years old, best pair of shoes I\u2019ve ever had. These seem to be just as comfortable and as high quality as those.", "Fits well but not as comfortable on the bottom of my feet as the last pair of Murrells I had, which have been discontinued.", "Best pair of hiking shoes I ever purchased! Awesome service and product!", "Great fit.

Absolutely no complaints with these.", "Great boot and worked well in the heavy rains and some snow! Very comfortable.", "Great boot. Finally found a great supporting boot that my husband enjoys working in and the fit and support", "The MOAB II Waterproof is performing admirably. Excellent comfort out of the box.

Im in the construction field and these fit and feel perfect. I dont need special toed boots so Merrells are the best. Ill always buy the moab collection. Super comfortable and they are waterproof very well ventilated.", "Feet get hot and sweaty pretty fast. Grip isn't all that great. My feet kind of spin a little bit when I'm walking on wet pavement.

An updated version of Skechers' classic golf shoes that earns praise for reliable comfort, thanks to the responsive foam insole Fits true to size Somewhat warm on the feet Not quite as stylish as some costlier brands, but considering the price you may not mind", "source_documents": ["Let me start by saying I LOVED everything about this shoe....for 4 rounds of golf. Round number 5 was today and the love affair is over. The entire toe assembly came apart where the leather meets to sole. These are meant to be quality shoes and I have had other Skechers that have been fantastic (though this is my first pair for golf). Of course, now I've had them for a number of months I can't return them, so its frustrating. If I had played months of golf in them, fine, things wear out, but literally I played 5 rounds and rode in a golf cart the entire time.", "I was a little concerned that the heel was low, but once I started playing it was not a problem. The shoes grip the turf well during the swing, with the added bonus that there are not soft spikes that wear out in a matter of weeks. I found the shoes to be very comfortable, so much so that I would have walked a few more holes after the front nine if I wasn't pressed for time. My goal is to eventually walk 18 holes on our local championship course, and with these shoes I feel that will happen sooner rather than later. No foot fatigue at all.", "Excellent golf shoes. Tried them on a very wet day. Much rain before and course very soggy. Feet stayed dry. Comfortable . My second pair of skechers golf shoes. Price is right. Cannot see how the more expensive shoes could be any better.", "Extremely comfortable shoe. Walked 18 holes and they were great- provided more than adequate traction- much better than my previous cleat-less shoe. It was a warm, dry day- 85 deg, and I had on fairly heavy ankle socks. My feet were a little warm but not uncomfortable at the end of the round. Did not notice any of the \"squeaking\" that others have complained about. Bought these for those\"heavy dew\" early morning rounds and wet day golf- Will defiantly augment these shoes with a pair of non-waterproof Sketchers for those really hot days of golf!!", "I was looking for a comfy, casual, and lightweight shoe that is OK to wear at a country club without being too stodgy or over the top.. These fit the bill to a tee. (OK to groan) These fit me perfectly, (The Adipower S Boost were too narrow and no wider size was available) and I slid them on and played 18. A bit damp and chilly this AM, but the feet were dry and warm. No slips or slides. Very stable and I did not feel I was turning out of them at any time. If these Skechers are on your short list, do NOT hesitate to buy!", "When I first put these shoes on I thought I was wearing a pair of slippers. Wow, were they comfortable! However, after walking 18 hilly holes, my feet hurt like never before. It felt like I actually walked 6 hard miles in slippers. These shoes offer absolutely no support for your feet. The soles are way too flexible to take the stress of walking 18 holes. These are just $100 cheap sneakers. I am an avid tennis player and learned the hard way that you need a much firmer sole if you want to protect your feet. These are going back.", "When I first put on these shoes, I have a very comfortable feeling. The materials is so soft that makes you feel good. The first couple miles walk is good but after 4 miles the toes begin to hurt. Seems like all the pressure are put on the toes. For short walk, it is good but not long walk. I bought this for gold and these shoes torture me after 14 holes.", "5 stars for being the most comfortable walking shoe I have used to date. 3 stars for being a bit larger then normal for that size 3 stars for annoying creaking sounds from shoe while walking, but willing to put up with the sound as the shoe is so darn comfortable. 1 star for bottom of shoe falling apart after four months of use. (walking twice a week, golfing for 3 months) Hence the one star, overall, rating for lasting only 4 months.", "These shoes fit perfectly and were very comfortable on the course. They are definitely not waterproof though. Rated lower because after one year of wear approximately 2 to 3 times a week playing golf and everyday walking, the bottom sole of the right shoe has come loose at the toe extending back about 3 inches. Would have thought these could have stood up to more wear than what I'm getting. Will look elsewhere for my next pair of golf shoes.", "I had an old pair of Skechers that were very uncomfortable but I gave the brand another chance because I really like their everyday shoes. I was definitely rewarded for giving Skechers a second chance. These new Skecher Golf shoes are fantastic! Wish I could say the same for my golf game! Still couldn't break 100 on my last outing...maybe if I hit the range in MY NEW SKECHERS I'd have better results!", "Was looking for a comfortable shoe with a lot of cushioning for playing soccer (yes! soccer!). These work great when it's dry. If it's wet, the nubs don't cut it (maybe for golf, but not if you're sprinting, stopping, and cutting). The shoes are extremely comfortable and greatly reduce the impact felt in joints and Achilles tendon. Like night and day compared to my cleats. They're actually suitable for wearing around the house / neighborhood as well.", "I like the Skecher name and reputation for comfort. I purchased the Go Golf 2 shoes on sale in size 91/2 M. These are synthetic leather cheap shoes BUT they are very cushy and have great traction on the course. I just finished 2 days of 18 holes each day and shoes were good. I need a relaxed fit or maybe a size 10 as these shoes are a little narrow and the foot box could be slightly wider. I hope they stretch/relax a bit as time goes on. Easy to wipe off and cleats clean easily. Everyone should try a pair; maybe in relaxed fit. Great buy.", "Very comfortable right out of the box! Liked the first pair I bought at Dick's Sporting store so ordered these in black as a second pair. Have already recommended these to friends who are interested in spikeless shoes.", "Knowing from previous reviews that these shoes tend to run small, I reasoned it would be better to have them too tight than too loose so I ordered my normal size. I also expected the shoes to stretch a bit with wear. I've now played several rounds of golf wearing these shoes and they have not stretched as much as expected. They are still snug but I believe going a half size larger would have been too much. The better solution I have found is to wear a thinner sock than usual. Otherwise, these are extremely comfortable shoes and provide excellent support and traction.", "I wear a 14EEE shoes and sneakers. Its usually very hard to find my size for my wide feet. I came across these golf shoes and ordered them. Delivery was fast,, the golf shoes fit better than I expected.. These golf shoes are as comfortable as my normal every day sneakers. They also look fantastic.. I haven't been on the golf course yet, but I am sure they will be fine.. As always, Amazon is wonder to buy from..", "I tried to walk 18 with these and boy did my feet hurt. If you want sketchers that are for walking these aren't for you. The ones to get are the GO GOLF Max Fairway version that look like tennis shoes with the mesh on the toes.", "They advertise the shoes that you can golf 18 holes and you feel like golfing more in their advertisement but after nine holes my feet are dying and by the time I finish 18 holes they're dead very uncomfortable what they feel like is like they have water inside of the things squishy and just squishy feeling and they have no support I would not recommend buying these shoes", "The shoes fit very well and have a nice look and feel. The cushion insole is quite comfortable. I usually play early in the morning when there is heavy dew on the ground. I wore these twice over the weekend and my feet stayed dry. I ordered a half size larger than my sneakers so I can wear good socks and they fit well.", "This is my second pair of Skechers golf shoes. I had worn Footjoys for many years. I'm not a Matt Kuchar fan who hawks the Skechers, but I got over myself and tried a pair. They are terrifically comfortable. I normally walk 9 holes when I play. I feel no discomfort at the end of a round and can often wear them into the clubhouse without even thinking about it.", "By far the most comfortable golf shoes I ever owned and I have owned so many. I can't commend on durability yet as I have only owned it only for a month now. The shoes look great, too. It they last over 6 months, they should be truly 5-star golf shoes, but for comfort and look, I give it a 5-star rating.", "I am a sketchers faithfull these golf shoes fit and are as comfortable as any sketchers i have ever bought. The size is always the same no matter what kind of sketcher shoe i buy and we all know that's a big deal. If you wear size 9 order a size 9. The width you need is on you to order correctly. I have been buying sketcher shoes for at least 10yrs. Maybee even 15yrs.. I have a hard time trying anything else... I have never had a shoe from sketchers that wasn't a quality product.. they might cost a few more bucks than the cheaper brands, these are classic example of you get what you pay for... sincerely, 2doggs...", "THE most comfortable Golf shoes I have ever purchased. Playing lots of golf, this shoe was so comfortable that I walked around afterwards in them and wasn't in a rush to change to another shoe. You will quickly forget that you are even wearing a golf shoe. I will probably stop purchasing other brands after owning this pair seriously. 4-5 hours is a long time to be uncomfortable so you may want to take this review seriously.", "With 3 rounds in all is well. Durability is important to me. I clean my shoes after each round and apply a silicone polish so expect quality to last without sole separation that has occurred with other golf shoes. These are extremely comfortable and fit to size. A lightweight shoe with good support and comfortable cushioning. If these pass the test of time would purchase again in a heartbeat. And at a price point that shames other shoe makers.", "I have several pair of Skechers street shoes and they are all very comfortable, so I decided to try the golf shoe. I was not disappointed. They fit well and are very comfortable. Very nice looking also! I have a wide foot and have had trouble finding good golf shoes. This pair is wide and fit just right. Would not hesitate to buy them again.", "I have fairly wide feet and I was sure which size to get so I ordered a pair of EE and D widths. The length was perfect but the EE was a bit too wide. The D fit good so I kept them and sent the others back with the free returns. I like them so well I ordered two pair of similar Skechers walking shoes.", "I purchased both cleated and uncleated Skecher golf shoes, and well as normal a normal Skecher walking shoe. They are all significantly comfortable, especially on my wide feet. The only concern I have is with the cleated golf shoes. It appears that the cleats are soft and will wear down quickly over time.", "The Skechers are VERY comfortable. Perhaps the most comfortable golf shoe I have ever worn and I have tried a lost of them. I have problems with my feet (I often change shoes 3 times a day for relief). I almost never wear the same golf shoes two days in a row. I did so with the Skechers and had no problem. I thought it was a nice extra that the shoes came laced with the white laces in the picture but they included an extra set of blue laces in case they were preferred. I will buy Skechers golf shoes again, and probably some other day wear type shoes as well. They are COMFORTABLE.", "Ordered 1/2 size up and fit great. Played 81 holes in 3 days right out of the box and my feet were the only thing that didn't hurt. Love these shoes. Update 8/30/17. These are the most comfortable shoes. Played in a golf outing that I run for my sister's medical expenses and played 18 the day after walking Bethpage Black. So comfortable and stylish that I wore them all through the evening banquet as well.", "I had been interested in the Sketcher golf shoes and actually stopped at one of their outlets. They didn\u2019t sell them there but they told me to try on a different series of shoes to f8nd the correct fit. I ended up ordering a pair through Amazon and was blown away at how comfortable they are. I almost always walk when I golf and this is without a doubt the most comfortable pair of shoes I\u2019ve ever purchased. These are actually the second pair, I ordered this pair. after 2 rounds in the original so I could have a couple of color varieties. I\u2019ve played in dry and wet conditions with no traction issues and no wet feet.", "I\u2019ve been wearing Sketchers shoes for several years. I didn\u2019t want to spend a out of money on golf shoes. However, after order two other pairs of golf shoes and them not fitting I decided to not put a price tag on comfort. It\u2019s is hands down the most comfortable golf shoe I\u2019ve ever owned. I played this morning in wet conditions and didn\u2019t slip at all. I wear a wide shoe and Sketches know how a wide shoe should fit. Buy them, you\u2019ll love them!", "Shoes were narrower than expected, much narrower than other wide fit skecher shoes that I own. Also like many other customers have commented, shoes made irritating squeeky sound with each step. I ended up returning the item, and Amazon very promptly processed my return.", "I really liked the comfort of the shoe. It did make a little squeaking noises when walking but I did not mind it. The issue is with the sole of the shoe that is glued on the shoe. After about 5 rounds and some time at the range, the sole of the shoe came unglue and now the shoe is unwearable. Of course it is now out of Amazon's return policy and Skecher only warranty their products for 45 days. I really liked these shoes and would buy another pair if I had confidence that they would last more than 5 rounds.", "The good: Feels like walking on pillows, so comfortable with good grip. The Bad: the cushion material around the back heel came loose and sank to the bottom of the shoe, creating an annoying bump that you feel with every step. So after 1 year, i'm looking for new shoes.", "Since I received these shoes, I have worn them three time playing golf. They are very comfortable and fit very nice. I did notice as mentioned by others, that they had a tendency to squeak when walking. I took care of that. I took Mink Oil that I use on my hunting boots and applied a couple of thin coats to these shoes. No more squeaks. I would recommend these golf shoes.", "The golf shoe is really nice;, however, use a shoe horn as the first pair I had the interior lining of the heel between the inside and outside of the shoe broke down and made the shoe uncomfortable. I got a new pair, same style, and now use a shoe horn.", "This was my favorite pair of golf shoes until the heel half of one sole came completely detached. I\u2019m sure that I wore them 30 times in the 18 months that I have had them. I have numerous pairs of golf shoes so I seldom wear a pair more than every couple of weeks. Never saw this happen to a golf shoe before.", "These are probably the most comfortable golf shoe that I have ever worn. Having said that, they are probably the noisiest shoe, bar none, that I have ever worn. On balance, the fact that I am ordering the white version should tell you something.", "Shoes were just fine, but id not fit me well. The heels were not snug enough. With each step, my heel slipped up and down a bit. I'm sure these would be great for a person with a different foot/heel shape. I am in the process of an exchange for a different Sketchers golf shoe that is described as having a different structure in the heel. We'll see...", "I wear a 10W and ordered a 10W. The fit is perfect. They are extremely comfortable on the course and traction during my swing was excellent on dry fairways. I have yet to test them on wet fairways but I don't expect any problems. Really light comfortable shoe that I am hoping hold up for a year or more.", "I bought these for my husband. He loves them. They are so comfortable. I have to say they look very nice on the foot. He wears them everywhere. I definitely would recommend these shoes.", "They arrived on time, they fit just fine but for some reason they squeak when I walk. I've tried different laces but that made no difference. This is the 2nd pair I've ordered and the 1st pair were just fine, but not these? Tg", "Comfortable, good looking, fit great. Wore them to 5 rounds of golf at 3 day outing for first time. No breaking in, felt great, from start to finish and put up with rain on first day, no issues with water. Use Magic Eraser pads to clean off dirt, look like new again.", "I gave these four stars only because they are a bit hot and don't breath on a hot day. They are high quality and a great looking shoe. Fit was as expected. If you golf in 90 plus degree weather you might think about a more breathable shoe.", "I will say first of all, with nearly anything Sketchers, you need to order one size larger than you normally wear. But as for the product itself, I got these for my avid-golfing Father, and he knows everything golf gear. Not only does he absolutely love these, I even caught him wearing these as casual shoes. Needless to say, this is exactly what a golfer needs in his gear bag.", "Bought these for my husband for Christmas when I was at a complete loss about what to get him. He loves them. He says they are the most comfortable golf shoes he has ever worn. They are like a really comfortable tennis shoe. Five people asked him about them when he wore them last weekend. They look really nice too. He also said they fit true to size.", "This is the 2nd pair of these golf shoes I\u2019ve owned in the last 3 years. I purchased this pair as I learned unfortunately that this model was being discontinued. I love these shoes! Love the tread design and feel like I have adequate traction for my golf needs. The best part is the comfort of the shoes. I sometimes play 27 holes and my feet never hurt like my back! I remove the shoelaces when new and apply mink oil/silicone to the topside of the tongue and surrounding area. Let it dry overnight and reinstall laces. This eliminates the \u201csqueak\u201d that is common with this model. Really a great golf shoe for the price.", "Great golf shoe! Very comfortable and fit like a glove...However, after only 2+months of wear, one of my feet was soaking wet after playing golf simply from the grass being wet from morning dew. How's that possible??", "Golf shoes can be stiff and too dressy looking. These shoes feel like sneakers but look like golf wear. My husband can\u2019t wait to get out on the course and use them.", "Very comfortable, water resistant, grippy. Modern Sneaker style golf shoe. Tiny bit squeaky but glad I can wear normally and use for other than just golf.", "The shoes are light weight and comfortable. They weren\u2019t advertised as waterproof so I don\u2019t know the answer to that but I would definitely buy them again.", "These are the most comfortable golf shoes. I am 62 years old and walk 18 holes 3 days a week. These are like walking on air. I have had both my knees replaced and I love these shoes", "I have been wearing shoes not nearly as comfortable as these. With memory foam in the sole this shoe feels great walking on the golf course or on the cart path. I will be buying another pair when these wear out.", "I ordered these for a golf trip and haven't worn golf shoes in 3 years only tennis shoes because of my feet. I could wear these everyday, they are very comfortable and I am very pleased", "Nice looking and very comfortable golf shoe. Squeaks loudly while walking. Don't play golf on wet grass because these shoes are NOT water resistant. They fill up with water from under the soles and leak. Put your feet up and you will have a puddle of water pouring out by the cleats. Only recommend these for dry climates, no good for New England", "I wore the Sketchers Jan 7 in Michigan so the course was fairly wet but these shoes kept my feet totally dry and since I walked were very comfortable. They also came with a spare set of laces, which are gray and I used those instead of the white. Great shoe and easy clean-up since the \u201cspikes\u201d are molded into the sole bottom.", "My feet swell and shrink through out the day so I have to purchase shoe that have a lot of adjustability. I have only worn this once as the golf season just started in Michigan. so far they seem to work so far", "I am 69 and therefore very old school when it comes to golf shoes. I decided to give the new trend in spikeless golf shoes a go and settled on Sketchers because my wife has had several pair of various styled Sketchers and loves them. I am happy to say that I am very satisfied with the fit and performance of these shoes and do enjoy the fact that I don't have to change shoes when I get to the golf course. Very impressive.", "Very good quality and there is no slipping on the golf course.", "Played for the first time in these Skechers when conditions were hot and very wet. Fresh cut fairways still covered in loose wet grass. After the round my feet and socks were dry. These are advertised as somewhat water resistant, but they did a great job. Cleanup was a snap. Had no problems with slipping in wet grass. Great shoe for the money. Time will tell if they hold up.", "These shoes are so comfortable. They seem to hold out water so far and I like the look. I would certainly buy another when these wear out.", "I tried these on and they are way too big, especially in the toe area. I had to put insoles in them to fit better. They definitely fit way bigger than the size they are. I could have easily bought a size smaller. I hope I can get used to them? I'm not saying they are bad shoes, just that they were too big. But that's the risk I took by buying them without being able to try them on first.", "Seem to be good shoes, and the fit is \"almost\" what I need - but a bit narrow in the toe box. Also a little longer than other 10.5's. Ordered 10 in greyand I think the fit is going to be good. Updated... Used a stretcher to widen the toe box. That plus plenty of walking, they are now wide enough. I walk 9 holes several times per week (so maybe 40 times in the last 2 months) and the tread probably won't last the season.", "Very comfortable shoes. The toe box is a bit wider than say Nike's, that is why they are sooo comfortable. Yes they are water resistant. Played a few days ago early, the course was still wet from nightly showers and morning dew, my feet stayed dry. Great shoe!", "I haven't worn them on the course yet. I tried them on , they fit. I have five other pair of golf shoes so when these shoes fit my attire I will wear them. Until then any review would premature. They are attractive.", "I like Skechers regular and golf shoes, have about a dozen pairs all the way around. What else can be said? Look good, feel good.", "At first I was apprehensive about an online purchase for shoes. However, sketchers are true to form and I went for it. These shoes are great. They fit perfectly, are comfortable, priced right and a pleasure to wear on the golf course. I would recommend these shoes.", "Good shoe of Skecher quality except for the lacing process. Utilizes a loop of nylon(?) for the lace. One is already starting to unravel, don't know how long it will last. Will have to jerry rig a solution.", "I've been a loyal Footjoy customer, but decided to to try the skechers golf shoe. I'm disappointed in the shoe, it gave me blisters on the back of my foot, (above the heel). Never had a blister with footjoys..", "Very good golf shoes. Comfortable and fit as expected. First 18 hole round I played with these, it rained the whole time. Feet were slightly damp at end of round, so as advertised, these are water resistant, but not waterproof. Feet did not slip at all while playing in the rain. Have played a couple more rounds with these shoes and they play as expected, i.e. comfortable and no slipping. Overall, a very good golf shoe.", "One of the most comfortable pair of golf shoes I've ever owned. The memory foam inserts make all the difference. They run about a half size larger than other shoes but are very well made.", "Very comfortable golf shoes and they look great too. They are only water resistant though so if you are golfing in the rain or the course is soaked, your feet will get wet. I typically wear a size 10 and the size 10 in these shoes fit my feet perfectly.", "I wore these for the first time last week on league night. It was a cool damp drizzly day with a couple a of heavy rain spurts. At the end of the round my feet were dry and felt great! I would highly recommend these golf shoes!", "Fit was excellent and comfort Outstanding! However too plain in appearance and I changed out the white laces for corresponding blue laces to break-up the all white blah appearance. Very comfortable to play golf in especially if you are a walker like I am. Tip..get blue laces!!", "I have been buying Skechers golf shoes for several years. This style is his favorite. He wore them once and can't quit talking about how comfortable they are. In fact he had me order another pair for backup. He bragged about them so much two of his golf buddies have ordered Skechers and they're happy, too.", "Bought these golf shoes since Skechers have the reputation of being a comfortable shoe. I am not disappointed at all. Very comfortable and have had no problems since my purchase.", "Very soft and non removable insole leads to a shoe that doesn\u2019t give lateral support. Comfortable for a round of riding but wouldn\u2019t like to walk 18 holes on anything but flat ground. Look great..", "Had to return my 11.5 and order a size down, but the fit and comfort are great after about 6 rounds already. I am really satisfied with the look too. Black is not my favorite shoe color bit looks really nice with the light details. The soft spikes give plenty of grip and seem more durable than I expected.", "I had a pair of sketchers shoes before and bought the same size in the golf shoes. So they fit as expected and grip well. They also look nice.", "A nice product for a good price. My brother was very pleased with his gift. He has very sensitive feet and suffers from gout but these felt good to him.", "I like the comfort so much I wear them around the house! Where can you buy a comfortable good looking pair of golf shoes for $50? Highly recommended", "I like these golf shoes quite a bit. I've only worn them a couple of times so far, but they are very comfortable and provide good support. They're \"cushier\" than others that I've been wearing, but that seems to be a good thing.", "This is the most comfortable golf shoe I have ever owned. It also keeps my feet dry even I was caught in a heavy down pour.", "As other folks have mentioned these shoes are a little noisy when you first get them. They squeak and they knock. However, there aren't many shoes you can pull out of the box and walk 18 holes and be comfortable the first time. These are great shoes once you get past all the additional noise that they create.", "I've worn these a few times now. The fit is good and they are comfortable on the course. Time will tell how well they hold up but so far, no complains at all.", "The only issue is the shoe base gave way and i need to use super glue to sticked it back. Didn't expect such quality shoes from Skechers though as normally it's has a stronghold base. Nevertheless it is the most comfortable golf shoes i ever had.", "Been looking for some Skechers for a long time as they are my go to leisure shoes. Found this awesome deal and made the purchase my favorite way (one click). The shoes arrived quickly and fit perfectly. Now if I could only order a decent golf swing....lol", "Would be a good shoe except for the squeaking sound they make when you walk. I was hoping the noise would go away after a few rounds, but after 10 rounds they are as noisy as ever. Great traction for a spikeless shoe. Insole has too much cushioning unless you have a foot problem, then I'm sure the excessive padding would be appreciated. Just too soft to really use ground forces.", "very comfortable right off the bat and I like the looks. two minor problems: seems hot (but I have yet to find a shoe that doesn't) and they squeak. The squeaking is in the tongue but I haven't been able to get rid of it w/talcum powder. Open to other suggestions.....", "I am so pleased with these shoes. I have wide feet and golf several times a week. Was hesitant to spend this much, I am cheap, on these shoes but after wearing them the other day I immediately noticed how comfortable and yet provided solid footing on a damp day. I understand why Matt Kuchar smiles so much now!", "Love these golf shoes! They are light and comfortable; the most comfortable I've ever worn. Some people don't like the style, but I don't mind it. The grey leather uppers are well made and look great to me. Mine came with two pair of shoelaces, white and grey.", "Perfect fit. Ordered 10.5 wide. Incredibly comfortable. I tried on a number last years models of shoes looking for better prices but nothing felt quite as comfortable as this.", "Having worn the old fashioned leather shoes with \"nails\" I was loathe to try these, but comfort won out....these are fantastic and so comfortable and light. I'm a believer!", "Just had one problem. The shoe rubbed a blister on my right ankle bone. Other than that it's a good shoe.", "Nice shoe and comfortable. It is sized too large or my pair was just labeled incorrectly. I had to return because of size. I wear a 13 2E. I have ordered 3 pair of sketchers this year in that size and all fit great. This pair was a full size too large. I would try this shoe again if available one size smaller.", "It's hard to find really wide shoes that perform well and don't look like mittens. These achieve that in a very soft surprisingly stable platform which can go directly from the course to the street and back. Excellent concept and well executed", "OMG!! My feet are sooooo happy in these. Can walk and walk and walk. Don\u2019t get tired or sore feet. Sketchers rock!!!", "These shoes are perfect for me. Wide and high for a big guy. The shoes are well made with comfort taking precedent over \"new wave design\". In other words, they are comfortable shoes that look like comfortable shoes.", "Fantastic golf shoe I have two of this same type in white with the blue trim and another in charcoal.", "My dad loved these shoes. He said they felt wonderful. His feet are really wide and he plays golf a lot. I have even seen him wearing them when he wasn't playing golf, just like tennis shoes.", "The shoes are very comfortable. I had to order 1/2 size larger to get the correct fit. I was surprised to see that they carry a two year waterproof warranty.", "These shoes are nice looking, comfortable, and definitely affordable. I own, or have owned all of the top-selling brands of golf shoes, and these are as good or better than any I've owned. I will definitely be ordering additional pairs.", "Love these shoes. VERY cushioned and well made. While my knees ache, at least I can walk a full 18 holes without my feet hurting. I bought another pair before I even need them just in case they stop manufacture of this model.", "Walked 18 in a very wet course and my feet were dry and very comfortable. These may be the most comfortable golf shoes I have ever owned", "These shoes are extremely comfortable and will be just fine for golf come spring. I decided to become more involved with golf and needed a pair of durable, comfortable shoes. These fit that bill and more. The price was excellent and the color and feel are great. I would recommend that anyone looking for golf wear take a look at these when deciding about a purchase.", "Incredibly comfortable and good fit! Went to play early one morning to find out they aren't waterproof. I didn't realize until 2 days after my return window closed. My own fault.", "Worst fitting shoe I have purchased on Amazon. I ordered and received my exact size, but the Sketcher I received had to be at least 1 to 1.5 larger. Unfortunately, I went ahead and wore them twice (though I should have returned them immediately) so I assume I am now stuck with them. Though my feet moved around a lot when playing, at least my feet didn't hurt much (which is why I bought them). These shoes are also ugly and clunky. Reminds me of my old Chuck Taylors of years gone by.", "Really made well. looks great and real comfortable. The bad news it didn't improve my golf game but you can't have everything", "Without a doubt, absolutely the most comfortable golf shoes I have ever owned. I currently own Adidas Traxion and Footjoy Superlites and the Sketchers are wayyyyy more comfortable. I bought 2e, because I have a fat foot and could have easily done with standard width. I have probably played 30 rounds in these kicks and they have little to no wear.", "I bought these for my husband and he loves them. He says they are the best golf shoes he has every had. They are light weight, comfortable, true to size, and looks like a tennis shoe (which is the look he wanted).", "Nice looking shoe. Waterproof. But it doesn't breathe at all--get ready for hot, sweaty feet. It also lacks any arch support, as you might find in a better shoe. It is OK, but an example of getting what you pay for.", "Out of all my shoes, this is by far my most comfortable one and it's a golf shoe. I need this in a regular shoe please. Con: Very squeaky.", "Absolutely love this golf shoe. Comfort is exceptional, stability great, traction perfect. Sick of paying >$100 for golf shoes. The dogs are usually barking after 18 holes. With these I'm not dying to get them off.", "I play in a mixed league and everybody walks. When I finished my first round with them I hated to take them off. They were much more conformable than my old shoes. I wear orthopedics inserts so I really can't answer the arch support question, I bought wide shoes to fit my inserts. There was a lot of dew on the grass but, my feet stayed dry.", "Are use this to play golf after the first couple of weeks the soul started to come apart I tried to glue the first pair and didn\u2019t work so I ordered another pair and then sent back the first one so now the second pair is Also coming apartThe rubber soul kept coming apart and the left shoe when playing golf Can you send me another pair or refund me please", "The back of one of the shoes had the padding squished down. I can't fix it. I couldn't locate the seller even though I purchased thru Amazon. Over time it is less noticeable. These are great shoes, I have other sketchers. but again, this one was faulty and I could not resolve it thru Amazon, couldn't even find out who in came from.", "Ordered a wide and they sent a double wide. The shoe itself was of really good quality and if they sent the right size I would have kept them.", "My first pair of Skechers golf shoes and I can say so comfortable cushioned feel. Also they looked really nice and hold on so no slipping during your swing. First of many to come.", "Love the shoes. Have worn Footjoys for years, and these Sketchers are totally superior.", "Fit was excellent. Ordered half size large 2W. Played 18 holes and wore them home they were so comfortable. Ordered another color the next day to use as casual shoes. Shoes are not as soft as those Kuchar advertises.", "I was concerned about buying shoes on line. Not a problem here. These fit perfectly as if I bought them at a store. They also came with extra grey laces. I put the grey laces in and saved the white for emergency need in my golf bag. Excellent shoe, very comfortable.", "These shoes are not water resistant, waterproof and shouldn\u2019t be near any kind of water. My socks and feet were soaked in a matter of 30 minutes, and I was walking on a fairway with dew. It was my intention to give them a try based on a recommendation, and by my own fault I\u2019m 2 days past the return period. Buy something other than these!!", "Just purchased these shoes a week ago and played 7 rounds of golf. The shoes are very light weight compared to regular leather golf shoes and the gripping surface is just as good. Therefore I do recommend these shoes.", "Can't say yet how they will be until I get a chance to wear them at the golf course. I will have to wait until warmer weather. As of now, they seem very comfortable, looking forward to trying them out.", "Double wide was perfect for comfort. Glad for that option. Well made. Arrived as promised.", "Perfect fit. I was surprised that a label on the box read extra wide despite reading that wide was only available. Tried them on and they fit perfectly. Not Extra wide but wide as ordered.great", "While these are comfortable they are terrible in any kind of moisture. They are not stable.", "These are the best golf shoes I have owned. Might be the most comfortable shoes I own, period. They seem to repel water nicely as well. I ordered a second pair so when the first pair wears out I will have another pair at the ready. Highly recommended.", "These are very comfortable to wear. They are stable for golfing and provide good traction. These are not very good at keeping your feet dry in heavy dew or wet courses.", "Shoes were okay...but they are squeaky. I see others with this same comment. Skechers is my favorite shoe BUT they could have done better with this golf shoe. Is there a remedy for getting rid of the sqeaky.", "Wonderful golf shoes. Very light yet durable. Bought it because I like my shoes to be wide, and they are Very comfortable. Highly recommended!!!!!", "I sometimes wear a 9.5 or a 10...I ordered a 10 in this shoe and it fit perfectly.

Also looks good and keeps feet dry in rain. Highly recommend these shoes for the everyday golfer.", "Been golfing for 28 years, never owned a golf shoe as comfortable as this. Great performance too. Highly recommend.", "CAN LIVE WITH THE SIZE ISSUE, BUT THE SQUEEKING IS JUST TOO MUCH.. WENT BACK TO MY OLD SHOES..", "Very comfortable shoe and looks good. Originally ordered 10.5 W, but as opposed to Adidas, this is seriously wide! Ordered the normal width and it was perfect.", "Too small and narrow. I wear a 9. Bought a 9.5 and they fit way too tight especially the front near the toes. Overall the look was nice. It's tough to buy shoes online", "Very comfortable and no squeaking for me. The size 9 Wide fits perfectly.", "The most comfortable golf shoes I\u2019ve ever worn. I walked the course the day after I bought them. When I got back in my truck following the round I forgot to take them off. They do have an unusual groinking sound at times but it just reminds me frogs in the water hazards. Good grip, super comfortable. I recommend them.", "Great fit and very comfortable. The only dislike (shoes are hot to your feet). Need to be able to breathe better for cooler wear.", "After two rounds of golf, they still look nice. I have to wear thinner socks as this is just slightly narrower in the toes and I was feeling it by the 9th hole.", "These Skechers golf shoes are so comfortable! I have bragged to my golf buddies, and two more in my group have purchased a pair. Good look, comfortable, great price, super fit--I highly recommend this golf shoe.", "No complaints.

I use them in competitive shooting and they work great!", "The shoe fits well and very comfortable. Sketchers make shoes that are comfy. Love them", "I am hoping that these will loosen up around the balls of my feet. Other than that, theses shoes are very comfortable with great support. I am looking forward to \"breaking them in\" with several more rounds of golf in a relatively short time.", "Extremely comfortable, yet stable.

I am very happy.", "Great shoes for golf, plus I end up running errands and what-not before/after, and think they are better looking than most street shoes. Very comfortable and good looking. Only bad thing is that since they are white, they are starting to pick up scuffs from the course.", "These golf shoes look great and they are extremely comfortable. I played a round with them the day after it rained and my footing was great on the course. I never slipped out of my shot. Highly recommended .", "It is hard to get shoes that fit like a glove. I went to a retailer and tried on several pairs in this brand. The funny thing is that even though the shoe was the same size one was tighter and the other was bigger. Go figure anyhow I bought these and they ar a bit big.", "But very comfy. And the Good news is that it comes with an extra pair of gray shoe strings", "I have always worn Footjoys countour shoe. These are just as comfortable & I am looking to get another pair. Great price!", "Very disappointed!!!!! Golf shoe was very comfortable, fit perfectly , after three days of use in non-rainy weather they leaked badly. I wear sketchers shoes a lot and was surprised that we're a awful product. I just returned them for credit.in all fairness I will buy another pair of the same shoes and hope that the first pair was a defect.", "I ordered size 9 1/2, and received size 9.

Looks great and is very comfortable.", "Skechers is a great fit always, no matter what shoe. Hubby loves them from the first time he put them on.", "I have been wearing sketches for years.

THIS 11.5 fits more like a 10.. these shoes run at least one size smaller than other sketcher golf shoes.", "this shoe was smaller than expected.

Didn\u2019t have the \u201cdesperate to put on my slides\u201d feeling that most other golf shoes leave me with at the end of a round. Ended up buying several other sketchers goga mat shoes for running and walking. Awesome stuff.", "These shoes are fantastic, they fit perfectly, and while playing golf, it is like walking on pillows.

I plan to buy another when this one wears out.", "Seem narrower than an extra wide ( I bought 11 2E's) and they are very low in front so you better have perfect lying toes or there will be rubbing and pain on any toes that stick up at all.

After my first round wearing them my feet were very sore. I would not purchase Sketchers golf shoes again.", "Very nice and comofortable shoes for the price point.

I also tied the shoes extra tight. The heel is still a little loose but I can deal. As for sizing, I'm normally a 9 and these shoes were just the right size.", "I love these!! I typically am between a 9 and 9.5 and opted for the 9 in these as most people indicated they ran slightly large. I would say these run at least a half size small if anything. Also, some people mentioned that the heel slides off when you walk. I didn't notice that too much, my right shoe does it a little but I wear no show socks that have padding on the back so it's not a problem! These are so versatile and cute! They remind me of my favorite platform sneakers I wore in the 90's. I will definitely be ordering more of these!", "I have not gotten wear these out and about yet, but I ordered these originally in a size 8 (my normal size) and they were definitely too big. Ordered a 7.5 and they fit much better but I have quite narrow/skinny feet so they're not hugging them or anything. Have to tie them a little tighter to get a good fit. Very flat soled shoe which I expected and don't mind. So far I like these shoes just walking around the house. Also please disregard my socks lol", "Super love these shoes. I get compliments on them all the time. They didn\u2019t give me blisters, either, and I get them really easily. I love the little lift they give me and how they make my legs look longer.", "I am consistently a US size 9 across every brand of shoe I've ever encountered... except Superga. This shoe runs a touch big, and the 8.5 is a perfect fit for me. They arrived in beautiful condition and as advertised. Highly recommend!", "Hideous- daughter likes them. She gives 5 stars but I give 1 because they are ridiculous-looking and I paid for them", "Purchased for my daughter. She has worn them for approximately 2 1/2 months, and NOW THERES A HOLE IN ONE TOE! This never happened with shoes from Fila, Adidas, Converse, Toms, Or Vans. Let\u2019s be clear: these are NOT being used for exercise, but literally for getting out of a car to go to school, walking around during classes, then getting back into the car at the front entrance. She has many other pairs of sneakers for her athletic sport. Will email superga and see how they respond.", "This was my first time purchasing a shoe like this. I purchased them for my trip to the Phillippines which was where I experienced my first wear and what a mistake. I had blisters on the back of my foot by the time I returned to my Airbnb. I purchased gel protectors to add inside for the second use, however, the bagginess of the shoe still made the wear very uncomfortable. I have not taken them out of the box since. You can view pictures of me wearing the shoes in Phillippines and see the heel of my foot coming completely out of the shoe as I pose on Instagram @iamjackiewade", "I loved this shoes! I ordered one time with my normal number 9 1/2, and it came a little bit large, so I ordered again half number smaller(9) and fit perfectly. And it is super comfortable.", "I bought these for simple style not really comfort. These shoes are not comfortable enough to walk around in all day, but they are cute for making runs. The shoes does not bend with your foot very well due to the thick platform sole. I don't get much wear out of them as I did when I first purchased them. I wish I went for the slip on/backless version for easier wear, but this style was more than 50% off when I purchased and the other style was still full price.", "I love the look of the shoe. I bought these for a European trip (anticipate walking). I wear a size 7 1/2 and the first pair was way to big. My foot was slipping out of them. I returned them and bought a size 7 and my ankle still slips out. I wore them once so I am not sure I can even return them. I am afraid I am going to get blisters on my ankles. They definitely slip out of them.", "even though I selected the correct size according to the chart..the shoe was way too large.. great looking shoe however. This is the last time I will purchase shoes online as I have not found one that fits..so please do not look on my 1 star rating, I had to select something or the review would not be submitted. The shoe looks very well made and is a very substantial shoe..just not for me this time.", "I am a size 7.5 US and I ordered that size for Superga and it was too big in the heel area of the shoe. So I returned it and got a size 7 but those were also big in the back of the shoe! My foot keeps coming out at the heel when I walk. It is really annoying with every step and I can also see it giving really bad blisters if you walk in them for too long with your foot coming in and out at the heel. They are very cute and look really nice on but It just seems too big at the heel area.", "This one is a beaut. I just got them in the mail haven\u2019t worn them out but did try them on and they are gorgeous. The perfect platform height for me. I don\u2019t know how comfortable these are tho but can update later. p.s it\u2019s true to size, whoever said buy size down...don\u2019t. I usually wear 7 and I bought 6.5 because of all the reviews \ud83d\ude44and it\u2019s a little snug.", "I wear these shoes every weekend since November. They have held up nicely. Like most of the other comments, size a half size down. My heel still slips out the back but thats just how the shoe is shaped and made i think. They are super cute and stylish and make any outfit cuter.", "These shoes are perfect. I tried on a pair at my local DSW to get a size reference and the 10 fit perfectly, but for some reason my size 10 in the yellow were a bit large from amazon. They\u2019ll still fit fine as long as I wear a thicker sock, so I don\u2019t want to go through the pain of going a size down and risk them being too small. Other than that, I\u2019m in love. They\u2019re super comfortable, came quickly, and I can\u2019t wait to wear them.", "I normally wear a 6.5 sometimes a 7. I ordered the 6.5 and a 7 according to the sizing. The 6.5 (36) fit but was slightly small, my toe somewhat rubs the side. The 7(37) was comfortable with no toe rubbing etc but seemed very big like maybe almost a size 7.5 or 8 US size. I kept the smaller ones to see if they would stretch some, and they are slowly. The 7 was just way to big and flopped. Overall they are super cute but the sizing is odd.", "These shoes are too stiff. They do not bend when you walk in them so your heel slips out the back. They are also very heavy but my main complaint is the stiffness and inability to bend with your step. My husband threw away the box or else I'd return them.", "absolutely in love with these! I was worried they would look too much like platforms, but these are not too bad. I wore these on a road trip in California and it was perfect with dresses, shorts, pants, jumpsuits. So comfortable! I wore to the beach and still can't get the sand out! Also, the wet sand stained it a bit and I cant wash these bc it's not recommended. a little heavy but worth it.", "I'm usually a size 6.5 but ordered a 6 since a lot of reviews suggested that. The shoes arrived fine and are really cute but extremely uncomfortable. The length of my shoe size is fine what is large is the ankle and surrounding area. That makes it so uncomfortable when walking. I tried using thick socks but it didn't help. I'm sad I have to return them.", "I have been waiting to get these shoes for the longest time and they had them on sale here! They do run .5-1 size too big depending on your foot. I normally wear a size 6.5 and a size 6 fits perfectly. Super cute and trendy. I haven't worn them out for long, so I can't speak about how comfortable they are, but they are easy to style.", "They look cool and are comfortable but are fashion sneakers not for even a small run when you are on a hurry because they are a bit heavy and the platform is stiff. However I still use them almost every day because they fit perfectly with every outfit", "These are incredibly cute and trendy, but I can\u2019t imagine wearing them without an insert. Since the thickness doesn\u2019t let them bend, your heel will slip in and out a bit without thicker socks or an insert. You definitely need to break them in for a while before wearing them anywhere with even a little bit of walking involved.", "Love platformed white sneakers. It is the highest platform I have in my white sneaker collection. It is pretty comfy and super easy to match with any outfits. The only one thing is my feet is pretty narrow, so it feels a bit loose for me. I wish it comes in 0.5size smaller, maybe it will be better", "There's are super cute and easy to wear! They aren't the MOST comfortable sneakers I ever worn but they get the job done! They only issue I have is that I have to tie these EXTREMELY tight so that way the back of my foot doesn't come out of the shoe. The shoe itself is not big for me, it fits perfectly, but for some reason my heel slips out when I walk even if I am wearing socks.", "They fit just like the other reviewers described. They are a bit heavy because they are platform sneakers. There is no arch support, but I bought insoles which fixed that. I have a bit wider forefoot and a very narrow heel area and others had complained that the heel area was too roomy and I found the same situation. However, I adjusted the lacing and I wear a thicker sock liner and they do great!", "Love this shoe, have gotten so many compliments. I read reviews about shoe being a little big so I went a half size down. I think I could\u2019ve gotten a whole size down instead but I wasn\u2019t sure and did t want to have to return them if they were too tight. I\u2019m a size 7 and got a size 6.5. I\u2019m just going to buy thick insoles and that should solve the problem of looseness. Other than that it\u2019s a great shoe and easy to clean.", "Love these!!! Good fit and cute design. A fashion stylist recommended that I add these to my wardrobe. She told me to go to Nordstrom...$80. I was over the moon finding them on Amazon for less. (The platform limits the flexibility of the soul so which to regular sneaks for long walks). I get compliments every time I wear them.", "Perfect! I did as other reviews suggested and bought a size down. I\u2019m normally a US6 and bought a US5 but if you like a little more wiggle room for your toes I\u2019d just go down the half size. They don\u2019t have any bend in them either but I was expecting that. Love them.", "Absolutely a must in your wardrobe! I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and these give me that added lift that\u2019s just right. As the other reviews have stated, they are slightly bigger. I\u2019m a 7 and should have gotten a 6 1/2. I do have a slighhhty wide foot so I went with the 7 anyway and shouldn\u2019t have. I put inserts in the front to push my heel back so they won\u2019t slide.", "Supergas run big, size down! I love mine. BUT, don\u2019t count on cushion if you\u2019ve never tried them on. Their minimalist sneakers. I can walk around but not for extended periods of time. I got a blister on my pinky toe and heal when I wore on long walk.", "this is my second time ordering these shoes. definitely order a half size down to get the right fit. I really like how they look but fair warning I had to replace my last pair because the sole starting coming off. I was using them a lot and had them for about 8 months before this happened. I really like them and wear them every day so its worth it but don't expect them them to last a super long.", "I am typically a size 8 in shoes. For these I ordered a US size 7.5/EU 38 and they fit perfectly. The shoes are platform so they do have a little weight to them. This is fine but causes the back to move a bit when waking (even if tied tight) which is why I imagine some reviewers reported discomfort/ankle pain. They do not feel totally flat inside but they do not have a great amount of support. These seem more fashion over function - I think they will be comfortable during daily activities but are not really for sports/hiking/etc. Great to catch them on sale!", "MAY HAVE GOTTEN FAKES. The label on the back of mine deteriorated very quickly. The shoes fit well & are suuuuuuper fashionable, but like others were saying, there's no support and they're not the MOST comfortable. (festivals = no, walk around the city = ehh, if there's chances to sit) The most redeeming factor is how cute these are.", "These are super comfy sneakers. They are a tiny bit big because I am an in between size so I always go half a size up. I didn\u2019t need to break these in at all. The first time I wore them was to a music festival (lots of walking) and my feet didn\u2019t hurt nor get blisters. Slightly heavier than normal sneakers, but that was to be expected since they\u2019re platforms and the bottoms are thick.", "I absolutely love these shoes. However, I am normally an 8. I sized down to a 7.5 because of the other reviews. There is no way I can even wear socks with these without my toe going through the front. I would suggest getting your NORMAL size and then getting heel insoles.", "I would definitely recommend sizing down a half a size. When it comes to comfort, they\u2019re not comfortable at all. They\u2019re extremely \u201cflat\u201d feeling. Also, when you walk, it feels like your heel is slightly slipping out of the shoe-not a lot, just a little. These shoes are super cute on, and nice to look at, but had I known those things listed above, I might not have bought them. So, I guess you have to decide which is more important-", "In love with these shoes! Been eyeing these for a while and finally bought them. Couldn't be happier. Went with the reviews and ordered a half size smaller (a 6.5 instead of a 7) and they fit perfectly. They are platform (don't bend, duh) and a bit heavy but great quality shoe and exactly what I was looking for. 10/10", "Although I loved the chunky design, the stiff sole and lack of heel padding meant that my heel slid up and down as I walked. I could see that I would get a blister if I continued, so I returned this attractive shoe.", "These are really nice, but these are hard to get a perfect fit. My package came with hair, so I think these are used? Which is why the price is a lot cheaper than the actual Superga website. I retuned these, but if you can get the right fit these shoes are super cute and eventually break in after a while.", "Happy with my purchase but runs a little large. First time buying Superga, I would go for have a number less on size. I guess it depends on your type of feet, mine are a little thin so they slip out a bit but the sizing is right. Really comfortable. High quality shoe material.", "These sneakers are the best and I was concerned that these were going to be knock-offs because they're selling for below what Supergas usually go for but after closely comparing them to my existing pair of real Supergas, as far as I can tell these are authentic!", "The shoes are really cute but offer no arch support and run half a size to a full size big. I am usually an 8.5 or an 8 but had to order a 7.5. Although they are kind of on the tighter side, I recommend sizing down half a size so you can insert heal inserts for support. Over all, really cute shoes for a relatively good size.", "I love these shoes! I kept looking at them on another website, but they were $80 and I didn't want to pay that much. I'm so glad I looked on Amazon. I saved $20! The shoes are awesomely comfortable and I love the way they look. The platforms are great because I am only 5' tall.", "These shoes are very cute but after returning them once because they were too big and my heel kept lifting up. The smaller second pair was too tight and my heels still kept lifting up. Wore them for an hour feet were aching and gave me blisters. Waiting for refund.", "I buy a 7.5 in almost every shoe I buy. For this shoe, I sized down a half size due to other reviews stating the shoe slips off your heel. I am glad I only went down a half size because other wise my toes would have been too tight. The shoe still does slip if you don't tie it really tight. I will invest in the insoles as suggested by another reviewer. I am very happy with this buy and cant wait to wear these all spring and summer they were exactly what I was looking for.", "I\u2019m an 8 1/2 or 9 in athletic shoes. I need arch support so a stiff shoe like this is ok. However, they come in European sizes and 39 is too short and 40 is to loose. So, these shoes aren\u2019t meant for me. Super cute and just what I wanted, though.", "I bought these shoes for my daughter during an Amazon Fashion sale and got such a great price. She had them in navy (birthday gift from friends) and wanted them in white. They fit true to size and she says they are really comfortable.", "These run large Im a 6.5US so I ordered the 6US (36). My foot measures 9in long. some tips to wearing these: You will need to add a back of heel non-slip pad to prevent rubbing/ slipping", "I have been wanting these forever! I love them so much. I do have to say they are a little bigger than what I am use to, I bought a size 6.5 which I normally wear that or a 7. But I honestly could have gotten a 6 I think. I\u2019ve already worn them, and it\u2019s fine so I am not going to go through the hassle of the return and order process again. Mainly because I love them and couldn\u2019t wait to wear them!", "Loved the look, but I have narrow heels and they were so wide there that my foot lifted out of them when I walked. Tried two pairs of socks...no go. Also, the thick soles are not flexible...I returned them.", "I love the platform style and they are so comfortable. I am 4'11\" and it makes me look taller and makes my legs look longer. They are heavier than I expected so it may not be suitable for long walks. Very cute.", "I love the shoe so far. I fluctuate between an 8 1/2 and sometimes a 9 ( since having kids, weird) So I originally ordered an 8 1/2 and it was way too big so I returned it for an 8 so much better. I can at least now wear them they do still slip the teeniest bit but not completely off my heel now! As long as you have some good no-show socks they are awesome! Will totally buy more colors!", "Cute shoe even though the sole is awkwardly thick. I would have kept them if the length was more like a standard size 7 instead of a 7 1/2. My heels literally would come out of the shoes with every step, so I sent them back new.", "When I saw that Amazon had these sneakers available and was $50.00 less than my local sneaker store I JUMPED on them extremely quickly. There so comfortable I think I'm going to get another pair. I love them so much. You will too", "i tried on, it slip from the back once you tried to walk, is a nice pair of shoes to put on the display, not for walking, don't buy them if you want a comfortable shoes and could walk.", "Order half a size less than usual. But I love these shoes theyre so cute. Not much arch support so I recommend getting gel inserts if youre gonna wear these a lot.", "Ordered a 6.5, since I'm usually between 6.5 and 7. But They were a little looser than I expected. However, I think if I slip on a sock -- it'll solve the issue. Was looking at this shoe on the Superga website but always hesitated on the price. Thank goodness for Amazon!", "Love these! I am a true size 7 in all shoes and the 6.5 (37) fit perfectly!", "I really like these shoes, they are just a little more stylish than the regular style ( w/out platform), and I like the extra height. I am disappointed though that they run bigger than the non platform style. I bought the exact same size in the platforms (41) and they feel about a half size bigger.", "Weird sizing. I ordered a 39 and was scared it wouldn\u2019t fit as I\u2019m usually 40. These shoes DO run big. Even these require proper tying of the laces to keep them in place. My feet are not W but a little over the normal width. They don\u2019t seem uncomfortable at all and they don\u2019t look exaggerated on my feet either.", "Funny fit at the ankles. The size is right but feet would slip out when walking. Laces were tightened. Still feet would slip out. Added insoles. Still no . Very odd fit. Had other superga trainers and had no problem with the fit. Will return. Horrible.", "Got so many compliments on these they do run a little large though. But great quality and super cute and a fraction of the cost! Just size down!", "I love the look of these shoes, they are comfortable but I bought my last pair on May 26th and 3.5 months later I\u2019m buying another pair because they already have holes in them. \ud83d\ude11", "WITH THE SUPERGA BRAND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO PUT AN INSOLE IN OR A HEEL LIFT IN, ON THESE I ONLY NEED ONE HEEL LIFT IN THE RIGHT SHOE. I LOVE THIS BRAND OF SHOE SO MUCH THAT I WILL MAKE IT FIT.. I WEAR AN 8 1/2 AND THATS THE SIZE THAT I BUY ALWAYS..", "I\u2019m glad i listened to the reviews and went half a size down. These shoes are so perfect! They are so cute and stylish. The toe box feels SLIGHTLY tight, given that i sized down, but my true size would have been way too large.", "It has taken a long time to break these shoes in, I don\u2019t know what the difference is, I had a pair in the past, but these seemed different, too stiff, just never have became comfortable! Sorry but it\u2019s true", "I have the Superga shoes in the platform style and regular. It is very hard to find shoes that have a decent amount of arch support, etc. The Superga platform style feels as if it has significantly more support than the regular. And of course, seems like they have 100's of colors. And I wear a 41 and Superga sizing seems right on point.", "Cute sneakers, very versatile. Runs slightly big especially at heel. Bought a size 7.5 or size 8 feet.", "I love the look of these shoes ! I was able to wear on my vacation with comfort if you don\u2019t mind the extra weight on feet from the platform . This color does get dirty fast but it matched many outfits!", "I just received these in the mail today and when I open the box, they were covered in hair, both human and some sort of animal. The souls are filthy as though someone has already worn them as well as the inside of the shoes. You can literally see the toll marks inside of the shoe. The top of shoes were also dirty; these were obviously worn previously!", "Usually wear a 8. I got a 7.5 after reading the reviews. They are wide around the ankle but a little tight in the toes. If I would\u2019ve gotten an 8 they would\u2019ve been too big. So hopefully with time they\u2019ll loosen up.", "Cute, but super uncomfortable. 10/10 will give you blisters. 10/10 would recommend to my worst enemy. - Kara M.", "I really like these shoes, they're exactly like what I imagine they would be. The only problem is they do run big, I'm usually a size 7 and I ordered a 6.5 since the other reviews said to go half a size down but they still are big on me, I couldn't return them since I'm not from the US but I would recommend to go a full size down, other than that the shoes are really pretty.", "I ordered half a size down because that\u2019s what all the reviews said to do and they fit perfectly! These shoes are very comfy, but I would definitely recommend wearing socks with them until they\u2019re broken in. I\u2019ve gotten so many compliments on them!", "I read So many negative reviews that I almost did not buy these shoes,, And thank god I chose to buy them. They are true to size, they're exactly like the picture and the brand. I LOVE them. I wear a size 6 and 6.5, but ordered and 6 because some say too big and I could've gotten the 6.5 , but they still fit fine! \u2665\ufe0f", "These are style shoes only. Not very practical.

They are cute and trendy but must be laced right or your heel will fall out of the shoe.", "They are a teensy bit loose, but they\u2019re some of my favorite shoes!! I\u2019d seen other reviews and didn\u2019t think the platform looked thick enough, but it\u2019s perfect!!", "SO stinking cute. But not the comfiest shoe in planet. I was looking for a walking shoe that was more comfy than my chucks, these ain\u2019t them. But again I wear them when I can (Short amounts of time) because they couldn\u2019t be any more adorable. They are tight on my big toe but slip off my ankle \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I bought these in my normal shoe size, 9. I literally cannot walk in them they come right off my foot with each step i take.. I bought shoe inserts and those don't help either. I have even doubled up on the shoe inserts and nothing helps. So bummed that I waited too long to return. They are a huge disappointment", "Very cute shoes, but walking around is like strapping blocks of wood to your feet, no bend at all. Heel also slips out even though I went down half a size as recommended. Returned.", "These fit as expected, I read many reviews saying to size down if you're in between sizes. I'm a size 6.5 or size 7, so I went with a 6.5 on these and they fit great.", "Heavy and the heel of the foot sometimes lifts up a bit out of the shoe. Now comfortable for walking.", "Way too small and not to size. Will not return but I don\u2019t recommend unless you order 2 sizes larger then they would be too big in the width", "the soles of this shoe make it very heavy and the back slides off your ankle as you walk. but other than that they are great !! also wear no show socks with these, it looks so much better and put together", "Seems to be a little difficult to fit properly. Heel slips up but unable to wear smaller size in length.", "Although I received them somewhat large, I already knew that Superga's shoes are all like that. It is very good quality and I love them.

They had not been worn, came like that fresh out of the box. Wish I had got a different color maybe something other than white would look less bad with the stains. Very disappointed", "Love the look, not the feel - from other reviews I suspected that might be the case. I can wear these out and be fairly comfortable when I know I won\u2019t be walking much.", "I received these shoes on 10/15 and the bottom of the shoe has already come apart after only a few wears. Very upset. Please advise.", "One of the holes (or grommet) came off on my third time wearing the shoes! It makes me wonder if the pairs on Amazon are authentic. I like that it's platform and it's pretty comfortable. Wish I can return, but I threw away the box already.", "I reordered these twice and they were still too small. The fabric is very stiff and gave me blisters immediately.", "I love these shoes and they're awesome for Summer but they are HUGE. I'm typically always a size 8, I went with a 7.5 after reading reviews, but they were falling off me when I would walk. I had to buy two different types of heel inserts to make them smaller, but they're still a little big.

Both soles had ground-in dirt all over them. There were skid marks on the rubber sides, which indicated wear. They came in an old box for Merrell flipflops.

If I'm paying 70 bucks for shoes, I would like for them not to have been frolicked in for several days by some stranger.", "These are great just gives you blisters for first few wears. Also need to make sure they are tied tight and I would strongly suggest wearing socks with them.", "These shoes are comfy and so very stylish, I am very happy with the fit and the hieght of the platform sole.

So not to wear for any athletic activities.", "I was really excited to get these shoes but they developed a hole in the toe after a few wears and another hole on the back.

They were not true to size either.", "Perfect style platform sneaker.. l have a little wider right toe.. but with a little stretch all good", "Shoes are cute. However, they run big so go down half a size. Additionally, they're not comfortable so I recommend buying foot inserts for support. Aside from that, I like them.", "This has the weirdest fit! No matter what size you get it always hurts the feet like hell. I'm usually 7.5 and 7.5 in this superga was way big it was flipping when i walked so I went down to size 6.5. It's still big that it flips over but somehow it's too tight on the back that rubbed my feet so bad had to blister up. Tried to break it in numerous times but it didn't work. Had to toss it. Would like a refund!", "This is a great shoe, very cute and versatile. It doesn't have much support and takes some time to wear in. They can be comfortable, I wear them during shifts bartending sometimes but I usually bring my nike tennis shoes and change into those about halfway through/towards the end of my shift. I would buy another pair!", "I like these shoes... and I so wanted them to be great... but the sole is too thick and doesn't give/bend as you walk. I'm keeping them, but won't wear them when I'll be walking alot.", "Hard to walk with but cool to wear...comes a bit big", "The shoes were indeed slightly large however it wasn't so bad that they were unwearable. Although it would have been better to bought it a half size down maybe. They were surprisingly comfortable, and the thicker soles provided more cushion. However the shoes did wear out very quickly and was soon bare behind the heels in about a month or so of wear.", "A little \u201c sloppy\u201d in the heel. But live the look", "I love Superga shoes but this one just doesn\u2019t work. It slips for the heel. They also run big. I bought a lavender pink and mint green. Love the color and platform style but doesn\u2019t work for me. I wore it already. I wonder it once so I wonder if can return it? I rarely have issues with shoes slipping off but this style does. Sigh.", "I advise sizing down but otherwise great price and easy ordering of these shoes. I wish there was a size between 6.5 and 6 :(", "It fits big for me. The quality is not as expected when it compares to my previous pair of Superga.", "Just as most people have said order a size down, they are a bit big and it does take some getting use to. I love them though, they are so fun to wear and add some extra height. I will be purchasing some more soon.", "I have owned this brand for many years and have been satisfied. My past purchases have lasted me more than a year, but my latest purchase is falling apart at the seams. I bought them 4 months ago and expected better quality and usage. I don't wear them every day and do not misuse them. Very disappointed.", "Very cute but that\u2019s it. Definitely not made for walking. Buy half size smaller. Heel slips and not comfortable to walk in.", "90s fashion is coming back and I love it. These fit just right and look even better than expected.", "the front of the shoe separated after just 5 days. unfortunately my daughter took them to Europe so going to be an issue returning them", "I really wanted to love these! I remembered that supergas ran small so I ordered a half size up. Needed to order even bigger than that! Its hard to break them in... there just so dang cute!", "Was very surprised to find these shoes on amazon brand new. Even on reselling websites like poshmark, people are selling these shoes used for a higher price. Would recommend, no complaints. Make sure you have no show socks!", "I ordered these sneakers a half size smaller and they fit perfect. I did add heel protectors because my heels were sliding and it did the trick. They are slightly heavy but are so comfortable. All in all, I would purchase again.", "Super cute and they seem pretty comfortable. I\u2019m usually a 5.5/6 but after reading some of the reviews I decided to get a size 5 and they fit perfect!", "The heel is loose and doesn't come in half sizes", "I searched high and low for platform sneakers, tried and returned a few, until I finally found these Supergas. Exactly what I wanted. The sole is thick, so they took a little breaking in, but completely comfortable now. They look great. I love them.", "I took a star off because whenever I walk my heel keeps slipping out if I don't tighten the laces super tight. It also pulls the back of my sock down whenever I walk. But it goes with literally any outfit and they're relatively comfy.", "I wanted a pair for so long, but I am so happy with this purchase and how they fit. I did size slightly up because trying them on ins stores they were tight, but I could have gone true to size", "The sizing is way off. I'm usually a US size 6.5 or a 7 BUT these were way too big. I would have to go down to a size 6 or even 5.5!", "Somewhat large due to width which seems to be more to do with the style rather than the shoe itself not being properly sized. I could've maybe worn a half size smaller but they aren't so big that I returned them. I have a medium to slightly wide width so I would say narrow should size down a half size.", "Love them. Sneakers run a little big. Had to go a 1/2 down.", "Love the shoes, gorgeous, and comfortable. I\u2019m a 7.5, purchased 7, exchanged for 6.5.

As the other reviews state, order half a size down.", "Bought these shoes with high expectations. Wore them for my vacation. Shoes are to heavy and my feet fall out. Bought shoes inserts and still nothing. Looks like I waddle. They fit fine perfect size but still my feet flop out.", "I had these on my wish list, finally decided to get them. They fit a bit loose but nothing Thant can\u2019t be fixed with a small sock. Nice chic looking Superga will definitely recommend", "These shoes are very cute, but very uncomfortable. My heel pulls out of the shoe, which lead me to tie the shoes very tightly to keep them on. I thought I was just breaking in the shoes, and that is why they made my feet so sore, but now I have constant foot pain for last two months because I feel that one of my nerves was damaged from these. I hope it has not happened to anyone else.", "Shoe is super heavy and is very uncomfortable. I was so excited when these came in but felt like I had a brick on my foot when I walked( not what you want in a sneaker) . Cute design but not very functional for everyday wear.", "These shoes are OK. I had high expectations but after the 3rd time I wore them the sole of the shoe starting coming off. They were a great price so 3 wears aren't too bad.", "Every time I walk the shoe is too loose even with socks.", "Fit me perfect. No bed in arch though, love them anyway.", "Now that I have the right size I LOVE these shoes. They go with anything and since they\u2019re all white cleaning is super easy.

I ordered a 7 and they fit great & haven\u2019t taken them off since! Love these shoes", "Super cute! Love the way it looks and looking forward to wearing them! I just got the shoes and I have worn them around the house but haven\u2019t walked long distances in them. Very cute on and comfortable!", "Fit and style is perfect! Love these shoes! I usually wear a 7.5 and I ordered a 7.5 fits perfectly!", "order a size down, takes a few wears to get used to as platform is very stuff and not bendable. super cute though! Ordered a size 9, normal size is 10. Fairly narrow.", "I\u2019ve purchased the same pair for summer 2 years in a row. Not because the others wore out but just like having a nice new pair of whites! The old ones are still in great shape and I wear them as extras when I\u2019m going somewhere that I know they might get scuffed or dirty from dust like at my daughters ball games.", "I love these since I have wide feet, and I struggle with finding comfortable shoes and these are nice. I haven\u2019t tried them for a long time but so far they\u2019re good. Will update though!", "I love my superga ! They are comfortable and suuuuper cute, I already put them I. The washer and they survived, very well made !", "Love love my Superga platforms, absolutely the most comfortable ever.", "I was nervous on how they were going to fit, I ordered a half size down after reading reviews and they fit perfectly!

Have to say, these are the best shoes I've ever purchased. They make me happy and I wear them every day! The white lasted me 7 months until I had to buy another pair.

Great value & great style", "Love the looks of the shoe but I had to send it back three times my regular size was too large the next size they slipped in the back the smaller size too tight this shoe is not for me", "I would order a half size smaller than usual! - I love this sneaker, I re-order a new pair as my other white Supergas get dirty. They are pretty easy to clean, they do take a few wears to break into.", "Thank you for your timely service and quality product. My expectations were met. The shoe is a little wide, however, I have a narrow foot. I felt the shoe may be a little wide at point of purchase.", "These shoes are weird but very stylish which convinced me to keep them. They\u2019re hard to walk in so you definitely need inserts otherwise your heel will come out the back.", "I\u2019m so mad. I love these shoes and the description says PLATFORM and the shoes that showed up ARE NOT platform. And how stupid is this you can\u2019t call them because of covid-19 SO MAD \ud83d\ude21", "Runs big in my opinion, but I love the shoes!", "These are my favorite sneakers and I wear them most days in NYC. This is my second or third pair because I love the way they look, they're very comfortable, and they match everything with a little more style with the added platform.", "Super cute and well-made shoes, but I recommend sizing down. I normally wear an 8.5, but these are very roomy and slide up and down on my ankle. Might be better with socks.", "was very excited for these shoes and loved them until 5 weeks in (after wearing them 2-3 times a week) the seams started ripping and the sole completely unattached. I have heard these were great shoes but very disappointed in the quality", "The rubber sole started falling off after a week of only occasional wear!", "These are the heaviest and most uncomfortable and stiff sneakers I've ever bought. Also, the size is way too big so I had to return the first time and buy a smaller size, which is still a little big. I just kept this one because I just didn't want to go through the hassle of returning again and needed white sneakers anyway, but 15minutes into walking in these, my feet hurt so much. Recommend not wasting your money on this.", "Love these shoes for work! They help me reach things at work.", "Perfect to wear with a dress or jeans. Since '90s nostalgia is in full swing, these are the perfect sneakers! Will probably buy another pair for the summer soon!", "Super comfy and cute! A little on the heavy side and they ran large.", "Super cute!! Definitely wish I listened to other reviews regarding size, need to drop 1/2. Love them!!", "I love these but wish they had half sizes.

These are definitely big but I am keeping them.", "I usually wear a size 8.5 but ordered a 6.5 (based on the reviews) and they fit perfectly! LOVE these platform sneakers. They are casual but also make a statement :)", "The ankle part would slip off, but I think it\u2019s just because of the weight of the platform. I love the sleek look it adds to my outfits though.", "While they fit perfect, the eyelets immediately bent over and basically broke. I don\u2019t excessively pull at the laces when I tie my shoes, so I am very dissatisfied and would like a refund.", "This was a cute shoe but fit kind of oddly.

They are very comfortable. Even though they are a platform they do not feel like you are walking on a platform. I ordered 37 1/2 for a size 7. They do slip on the back of my heel a little bit. This was with wearing a hose footie. With a regular sock I might not have this problem.", "Was worried that the shoe would be different because of the low price but was happy with what came in the mail! Super cute and make sure to size down because I am usually a 7.5 and I got a 6.5 and it fits perfect!", "Cute but unless you have really fat heels, this is not for you. Shoe slips off heel easily.", "SIZE DOWN! They are a good stable for anyones closet.", "A pain in the butt to break in, but once you do they become very comfortable!

The only thing is they have no arch support so after walking in them for a while they start to hurt.", "I ordered these shoes two times because I thought I ordered a size to big but when I sized down my heel continued to slip out of the shoe. I was so bummed cause I LOVED the look of these shoes but they are not realistic to wear. My heel kept slipping out every time I took a step.", "I followed the reviews and ordered a 1\u20442 size smaller. I am normally a Size 7, so I ordered a 6 1\u20442. and it fit well, just a little wide as my foot is very narrow. They fit well and I am glad I read the reviews first. Love the look, quality. Will wear them frequently, especially for travel!", "Quality, comfortable, shoe. It does run a bit large- as others said- however, note that you may have to order a HALF size down, rather than a whole size.", "So disappointed, these sneakers are so cute and felt comfortable but as other reviews have stated, the ankle opening is so huge that even after trying two sizes smaller, my heel still popped up out of the shoe with every step so I had to send them back.", "I followed previous customer suggestions and ordered a size down. I am a six, i ordered the five and they are the cutest things ever! I got black. May go for the white...love love love the little boost of the platform.

Plus the heel is very wide so I walked right out of them.", "The soles are quite clunky and heavy but that\u2019s to be expected with this style. I love the thick quality canvas upper and the chunky platform sole. Super eye catching runner.", "Love these!! I wore them for 2 weeks straight pretty much in Europe.

Extremely uncomfortable, and very poor quality", "Im usually a 6.5-7, but I went with a 6 because everyone said it runs big and they were right!

I get so many comments about them!", "Really cute but way too big in the back where the heel is.

I will be returning these and ordering an 8 or 8.5. I hope the larger size works for me!", "I so wanted to love these platform shoes. They are good quality, well made, and generous in width however...... after several tries to get the right size, I went from an US8.5 to U8 then skipped to a US7, they still did not fit. I agree with several other reviewers in that they run very large but more importantly when you finally have the correct size your foot lifts in the heel of the shoe even with sockets on. I am so disappointed as they look great and give us girls close to the ground an extra lift.....", "My fave pair of sneakers! They fit somewhat large so it'll be better to order a size down from your normal size. These shoes matches with everything I wear, from jeans to skirts and dresses!! It has a little platform heels which are what made me buy them from the first place; it makes my legs look longer and smaller, and its white!! :)", "Love them. A little too big but these are some of my favorite shoes.", "Within a few minutes of trying on the shoes, my left foot started cramping at the ball of the foot and my right toe felt as though it would develop a bunion at the nuckle if I were to continue to walk in them. The bottom felt hard, with no resilience or bounce as you might expect from a tennis shoe. I really like the design of the shoes, but sadly they were uncomfortable to the point of being unwearable and I had to return them.", "read a review that they ran small, they actually run tru size.", "I first bought a 37, which says it's equal to 6.5. Wrong. It was way too big. So then I bought a 36, or 6, and they were way too small. I tried wearing them anyway and got the most horrible blisters. I guess they don't do half sizes well?", "Abolsutely love these platform Supergas. I wear a 7 or 7.5 usually and I got a 37.5!! So cute, highly recommend!", "Those are my second Superga shoes , it\u2019s light blue , which is perfect match with my blue dress! I love them . Comfortable shoes as well!", "There is something odd about the size/shape of this shoe. It fits perfectly at the toe and mid-foot. However, my heel slides in and out, making me trip easily. I tried putting self-adhesive heel guards in, but that just made the shoe too tight, and my foot still slid in and out. I love how these shoes look, but am so very sad I can't wear them!!", "I haven't worn them yet, but I have tried them on but I do like them.", "The look of the shoe is spot on! I wanted a shoe to add height without being an obvious platform style - for the appearance, I grant 5 of 5 stars. However, a prior reviewer mentioned the strange sizing of the shoe which I noticed as well. I ordered an 8 and the length and width are good toward the front half of the shoe, but the back of the shoe is loose and causes a lot slipping (and rubbing). For the price, I would expect a better fit.", "This product did not fit my wife. Her work keeps her very busy and she did not attempt to return them for the correct size until the \"return window had closed...\" I hope that Amazon will find a way to allow her to return them for the correct size. Otherwise she is out the $79 she paid for them. This would completely destroy any money saving benefit we receive from Amazon. The shoes may in fact be great shoes and worthy of a great review. But until my wife can actually use a pair that fits they sit in their box in a closet as a bad purchase and therefore an unsatisfactory product.", "It was too small.. my number its 7,5 and it was ALWAYS THIS NUMBER and with this it was too small", "it is very cute and i wanna buy black one too!", "They are not as wide as I would prefer but I needed a shoe for my right foot while my left was in a post-surgical boot and these were exactly the right height.", "When I read the reviews before ordering, everybody said the shoes run large. They are right! At first I went down a half a size and they were still too large so I went down one full shoe size and they fit perfectly! The other reviews said the shoes were uncomfortable until they are broken in, but I found them very comfortable right out of the box!

I saw some reviews saying to order a size up, I ordered my normal sIze 10, and i'm happy I didn't order up. They are comfortable.

I have thick thighs (size 12-14 womens in most pnts/ bottoms) and am very tall (5'10) so I was worried that they wouldn't stretch or be tall as I wanted but they stretch PLENTY and are very comfy.

The cloth also didn't seem to hold up well in the ankle area and had an odd looking bump on the inseam due to the zipper's weight. I wanted to like it, but it just didn't fit well enough and I have a feeling the slouch near the ankle was going to increase with time and look even more awkward.", "They fit as expected as far as the shoe itself goes, but unlike the other pair of thigh high boots i have these don\u2019t have a string to tighten them at the top so they\u2019re constantly falling down. Overall they\u2019re really good quality and super cute but if you don\u2019t have super thick thighs then you can expect to pull them up after every step you take.

These are just pull up and it stretches. I have been looking for boots like this that will fit my wide calves and this fits perfectly! I may not be able to wear it with skinny jeans, but I can wear with leggings! Cute and comfy addition to my boot collection! Worth the money and the price is good!", "I took a chance on these, and was not disappointed! As a former figure skater, my calves are pretty thick and give me trouble when it comes to high boots. But wide calf boots are usually too baggy for me, especially around the ankles. These have just enough stretch to hug curves, stay up while walking, and look great. The soles are sturdy and supportive, but the tread is not particularly deep. You may want to add some sole grips if you plan to wear them in cold, wet weather. Overall I'm very pleased, and I plan to buy these in at least one other color.", "The first night I wore them I went to a concert and was standing for 5 hours plus. I must say that they were surprisingly comfortable and left me with little to no pain the next day. They fit just above the knee and are my exact fit. I would really like for the legging part of it to be a little tighter on the leg so I could avoid pulling them up, but they still look cute. I would definitely buy them in another color.", "I really wanted to love these boots, and mostly I did. They were cute and came up to just the right height. I unfortunately had to return them because they were not tight on my thigh. Where the top of the boot hits my thigh measures 17in (about mid thigh) and there was a 2in gap from the boot. It looked quite silly so I sent it back. I wish that thigh high boots would come in skinny thigh and wide thigh but oh well.", "Just got this today. I love it! I\u2019m 5\u20190 so was a little unsure how high these would be but it comes up to about mid thigh, perfect! Color is nice and fits true to size. Even allows a little room for thick socks.", "I mean they were cute and VERY tall (5\u201911 and it was almost too tall for me I rolled them down) but I had to return them because with having skinnier calves they were way to big around my ankles not even close to being tight like the picture and with one step they sagged. If you had a bigger leg these would def work for you but girls with skinny legs find a better option.", "The boots was nice and looks expensive, I ordered my real size 7.5 after reading the review that these boots are TTS. I just have to exchange it though for size 8, because although it fits, there is no room for thicker socks and it may hurt after awhile of walking, other than that these boots are worth buying!", "I love these boots! From reading the reviews I thought that they were going to be too small but, there were some reviews that mentioned being a bigger girl and the boots fitting so I was hopeful. I am completely satisfied with ordering these boots and I can't wait to wear them out. I tried them on right when I got the package and was amazed that they fit perfectly. I am a size 14 pants and I wear a size 9 in shoes. My thighs are on the bigger side so I am extremely happy they fit!", "Really pleased with these boots , they got some stretch & fit snugly up on my thighs without falling down yet don\u2019t squeeze - where they go up my thigh measures 19 inches - fits super comfortable . I got the color taupe & am very happy with the color . I already have some thigh high boots but wanted a flat boot because I knew I\u2019d want total comfort along with looking cute some days .", "I am beyond thrilled that I could find boots to fit y 19\" super plus calves. Thank you so much! Do you have the same stretch boots in higher heels?

So, the picture and design may seem similar to the Premier brand, but they are not the same at allllllll.", "beautiful boots, but the toe part was painful and unbearable. I could have used a stretch shoe horn. Breaking these boots in was impossible. I wear a regular size 11 and never had a problem until now.Please add wide with to our collections for all size 11 customers for shoes/boots. I had to give them away to another family member and was sad about this and should have requested a refund, but wore them out in resulting with many bruised toes..

And true to size I want a size up and I have room for thick pair of socks I may just buy another pair.", "I really love these boots. They stay up on my tonight, super comfy material. Can\u2019t say the quality of the boot is superb but you get what you pay for. I ordered a 9 which usually always fit me. I could have done with a 9 1/2 - 10. Not so uncomfortable that I can\u2019t wear them. I would definitely recommend these boots for the price. Just be weary on the sizing.", "Loved them ! I am 5'8 and 155 lbs so it is hard to find boots that come all the way to my thighs. These did and with ease, I will be ordering another pair in a different color.", "I have several pairs of over the knee boots, and these are by far my favorite. I love the ones without the drawstring! All of my other pairs have one and that\u2019s the one thing about them that i don\u2019t like. These look much sleeker and they stay PUT! More so than ones you have to tie! I\u2019m in love. They are the perfect height too.. definitely a few inches over my knee and i am 5\u20198.", "it actually stands in shape not like those shoes you tie at the hem. I will say that it doesn't necessarily fit my calves because mine are just skinny (i have skinny ankles) but it still fits the majority of the upper part of my legs'. I stand at a 5'7\" with athletic build body. Also it feel as though the soles are cushioned which was a surprising plus. Recommend.", "Exactly what I've been looking for! Comfortable, very low rubber/rubber-type heel, soft and VEGAN so no one had to die for fashion. What's not to like! I didn't need these for warmth, just fashion, so no lining works for me. They really are perfect!", "So comfy, bought my size, and even with a wide foot I have room for an insole. My legs are pretty slim so if I don't have thick jeans on to keep em up they slide down my knees a lil, but it's cool cuz they're made so they can be cuffed around the top of the thigh.", "They're fine for the price. They do start to slip down a bit when I'm walking, but it's not annoying and I'm able to pull them up again. Not a deal breaker. They fit as expected; I wear a size 8 and that's what I purchased. They're a nice light taupe color.", "Despite years of weightlifting, I've always been stuck with small(er) thighs. These fall down on me when I take 10 steps, and it's incredibly frustrating. It's more manageable when I wear jeans because I can safety pin the sides of the boot to my pants to help with the hold, but it's a lost cause wearing these with a skirt without anything underneath. Beware if you have smaller legs!", "I bought these because I've always had problems with boots because of my big thighs and calves. But these fit great I love them.", "It was way to big. The zipper is there for decoration and the string barely adjusts anything.

Really good quality for the price. I would buy them again :)", "Nice boots. I ordered wrong size and they were a bit too long for me, came up to my mid thigh, I'm not that tall , and the heel was a bit too flat. But it was good style and comfortable. A good style for taller ladies.", "These are great! I have thicker thighs and calves and usually have to buy wide calf boots. But these are perfect! They have just enough stretch to fit comfortably around my legs and they stay up! I've worn them with tights, leggings, and on bare legs, I don't think I would want to wear them over pants. They length is good, they fit as pictured just above the knee.", "As a reference, I am 5.4 inches. These boots are very high on the thigh. If you are short and want a mid-thigh boot, these are going to be too much. They are about three inches down from my bum. I almost returned them but I do like the actual quality and color so decided to keep them.", "I love the way these shoes look. The fit true to size and only slightly slip down my thin legs. The only downside is the left boot feels like it\u2019s made of a cheaper/different material than the right. Like it\u2019s stiffer and feels more.. plastic than the soft, suede feeling right boot.", "I FREAKING Looooove these boots....They are so BRIGHT shiny Silver!!! A Statement for sure you have to know how to rock them without being to loud.But I\u2019m in Love they fit as expected I typically wear 8 1/2 , but with boots I like to go up a half size because of thick socks But they didn\u2019t have them in a 9 .

Can wear alone with a dress. Jeans need to be skinny or leggings. But it's a good fit, won't slide down.", "I love these boots! I did size up by 1/2.

Perfect for the East Coast cold weather.", "These were very nice boots but unfortunately they just didn\u2019t look good on my skinny legs! They actually enhanced the skinnyness! They were slightly loose on me but I\u2019m sure would fit fine on someone with normal legs. They were also too dressy for what I was looking for but otherwise very pretty and if I were younger and had bigger legs I would have kept them!", "Very comfy and you can wear them with a lot of different style of outfits. I'm not sure how long thy will last though. Definitely throughout the season though.", "Read reviews that it fit big calf thigh girls. I have thick calves and thighs but am only size 6-8 in pants, so figured they would fit based on reviews. Nope, had to send back. Made muffin thigh rolls :(", "Shoe part is comfortable. True to size.

Maybe if one wears a thick pair of leggings, they may stay up in place.", "Good quality but runs really small. I tried 7.. and i think I need an 8/8.5", "I think these boots are super cute! I like to wear mine with dresses for a transitional fall look. I got the kind with a draw strong because they were $5 cheaper than the ones without. They do slip a little so i tighten the drawstring until they don\u2019t slip which can be a little uncomfortable but overall they feel really good around the feet/toes. I only wish they had half sizes because I\u2019m an 8 1/2 so had to go to 9 and I can definitely tell", "I paid for a NEW pair of boots and received a very worn pair of boots.

I ordered an 8 in two different colors. One color fit bigger than the other for some reason. I ended up having to buy shoe stretchers.", "Loved them! I wear an 8 they fit true to size. Stretchy for knees & calves. Fit great.", "I didn't like these boots at all. They don't stay up and the soles have no grip so you slide on any smooth surface. They do fit true to size so for that one star.", "These Boots are really beautiful and comfortable. They fit great, and I get lots of compliments.", "Fit was as expected, but top was stretched. They were returned.", "These look great and are comfortable I just wish they fit a little more snugly through the calves.", "Runs about half a size small but my GF loves them!", "Very pretty but doesn't stay up for nothing.

They fit well and are comfortable. You can wear them high or low if you like.", "Purchased in two coolers and both were ill fitting. Arch and overall size hurt to walk.", "I ordered these boots recently in size 10 and the fit was beyond expectations. I usually wear wide widths but I took the chance and was happy they were comfortable. Also of note, I have somewhat thick calves and my thighs are quite thick and they fit at a great position on my 5'9 frame. Just be sure to invest in something to hold the boots up to prevent falling like I did.", "These boots fit perfectly. I always wanted thigh high boots but can never find any boots that fit my thunder thighs. So happy I got these boots. Will be buying more in different colors.", "I love olive green so these boots are my favs! They happen to fit my thigh well enough that they don't slide down too much - maybe 1/2\" or so while walking. They are comfortable and warm as well. I received them on time and they are well made. I also appreciated the personalized email I received from the seller. Would order again.", "LOVE THESE BOOTS! I'M A BIGGER GIRL AND THEY STILL FIT PERFECT!!", "The first time I work the boots they fit perfectly. The second time the kept falling down & would not stay up above the knee. They fit like slouch boots now. Very disappointed.", "I am so sad about these boots. They are so cute but came about a size and a half to small. Hoping to be able to get a bigger size. Recomended same size i wear but when they arrived they were about a size and a half to small. Order at least a size bigger.", "It is worth buying these boots. I love them they are warm and comfortable to wear everyday. I got What i was expecting. True to size you guys should buy them.", "I really what to love these boots but there just ok. Unfortunately when I wore them out I realized my right boot kept sliding down unlike my left boot fit perfectly on my calf and thigh. It's seems like someone tired on my right boot and stretched it out.", "Perfect knee high boot for winter or fall or hell even. Spring! Fits perfectly and the suede material feel amazing ! My favorite new boots . Will be ordering more colors asap", "There is no tie in the back so if you aren't tugging them up every minute they slide down to your calves. Very annoying.", "i like the boots and they fit on the foot and my thighs just right. The color was prefect. Love , Love them. Has sparked others at work to buy some.", "I love these boots. Normally wear an 8.5 - fit is accurate so order your normal size.", "Cheap Material, uncomfortable bottom, goes way too high on the thigh.

I definitely can\u2019t wear them without think pants because they fall down a lot.", "Love them! Fits true to size and so flattering for legs (that black line on top of boot in picture is a shadow..not lining popping out or anything)", "As someone with a muscular calf (16 in), I was impressed these fit. My only complaint is that they slip down quiet frequently and the zipper bunches at your ankle. They're cute for the price. Will probably last through this season.", "These shoes are waayy better than I expected, granted I have only wore them once but I had them on for over 8 hours The only downfall is they fal down a little and I wore them with jeans. Other than that they ate perfect and such a good price", "I\u2019ve got thick thighs and they fit comfortably and look way more expensive than they were.", "Slips down even when I'm not moving.

I have thick legs so the boots are able to hold without sliding down.", "it was super cute at first, fit a little snug. the only con i have about this is after wearing it out for about 2 hours, the left calf started coming down and i kept having to pull it up. disappointed cuz the boots are so cute \u2639\ufe0f", "I love these boots, for a girl with thick thighs it\u2019s really hard to find boots that will go up to my knees and actually fit.", "These boots are sooooo cute but I ordered an 8 and they are way too small even with thin boots.

Only thing is they tend to slide down every now and then", "I love theses boots i want them in every color just remember to go up a size run kind of small", "Love love love these boots! Great investment and they look amazing on me.", "The boots seem to be of good quality and look great and stylish - with that said, the boot slides down very easily on my leg i wore it with a dress no jeans or leggings to hold it up - had it not been for that issue the product would be 5 stars. I have pretty thick legs and thighs so I don\u2019t think my legs are the issue.", "These boots are super cute and I love the fit! They are a bit narrow but you can break them in. Only have 2 stars because the heel of the shoe is literally coming on.

So sexy and and soft, exactly what I was looking for", "Perfect fit! I got a size 10 which is what I usually wear. It fits really well on my thighs, but sometimes I have to pull it up.

Had to order the olive one's too \ud83d\udc96", "Ordered a size 8 in the black and fit perfectly! Very slimming and great material.", "Love these!!!! I\u2019d give them 5 stars if I could figure out how to keep them up.", "I am 5'0 154 pounds and I Love them.. They come beyond my knees but its a plus!!", "They are very soft and nice! Two cons: I'm taking off one star is because I don't have very large legs but up toward the thigh it becomes pretty tight. They fit me nicely but for someone a bit bigger it wouldn't work. Also, they are a bit difficult to get on. I find myself pulling the fabric of the boot in order to slide my foot in. I could see this wearing on the boot eventually and possibly tearing. Overall though I enjoy them!", "Ladies big ladies PLEASE BUY YOU WONT REGRET IT! Okay I inboxed and they smell fresh and new, shade looks great suede is perfect. I slipped literally slipped these bad boys on and oh my god I\u2019m in love. Finally boots that fit my legs and extend them too that\u2019s a plus. FAULT is that right after I stood up and walked viewing them they FELL DOWN FROM MY MID THIGH TO JUST COVERING MY KNEE. I would have loved for them to stay thigh highs! But I guess I should just be happy I have knee highs! Lol... great buy!", "I really love these boots. I bought a half size bigger and voila! They fit perfect.", "I liked the material but it felt apart quickly :(", "They're thigh high boots. That's really all I can say. I've had them for over a month. They're not stretchy but at the same time, very baggy. I wanted a more skintight look and this is slouchy. Kept falling down and slouching by the ankles. I even tried doubling up on socks. It's annoying yo have to keep pulling up the boots when I walk for more than a minute. I'm thinking maybe I'll add some elastic to the top. Also the suede looks old. It isn't a rich black but kind of grayish.", "Ok I just have to go to the post office to pick up it I don't know why Amazon left the package in the post office. By the way the thing here is the boots, I always have problems with boots about my calf, so I thought this stretchy boot will be perfect but this are too wide, to big. The quality is very good I really like it but it make wrinkled all my leg long and I'm not a skinny leg. I think I'm going to return it.", "These are cute boots but I'm glad I ordered a size up so I have room in the foot to wear comfortably. The one thing that bugs me a ton is the zipper on the left boot is bulging/busted so it can't come down all the way! I can get my leg in/out so I'm not returning them but not sure how long they will last sadly.", "They fit well but they slip down my thighs, socks do help though", "Although they do fall down a bit, these boots are cute and very comfortable. I plan to make some sort of elastic holster to help keep them up.", "Very loose in the calves. If you have thick legs or want a \u201cslouch\u201d look. They wouldn\u2019t stay up. Sizes are a bit big, I wear an 8, bought an 8 and it was more like a 8 1/2-9. Sent back.

I bought a pair of Charles David ones that look just like these an inch or so shorter for 55 bucks online at Off Saks. They didnt look as cheap but they were 25 more. So I guess you get what you pay for.", "First I would like to say I love these boots! I have really thick thighs so it's been hard finding boots that would go over them. The only downside to these is the fact that they are constantly sliding down, and I am forced to pull them up every few seconds. Other then that the color is great, the texture is nice and they seem pretty sturdy.", "They look nice but run small. I returned mainly due to them being so tall. I am almost 5'8\". They came too high up for my liking. Much higher than some others.", "These boots are lovely though they don\u2019t stay up. They got stretched out after ONE wearing. That\u2019s not normal. I\u2019m disappointed. Perhaps mine were defective....?", "I am glad I bought these boots they came right on time for my date on the weekend and my boyfriend said I looked sexy in them.

Very surprised I was able to zip these up with no issues. I normally wear an 8 1/2 but these are a little big so I'd say order a half size down.", "Quality is ok. Pretty much what you would find at the mid level boutique at the mall. The size is completely off. It's at least a size bigger than it's advertised.

Fairly comfortable. Run a little small. I wear a size 9, really could've used a 9.5. Durability, not great. After 2 months fabric is beginning to rip by shoelace.

I should've listened to the other reviewers. \ud83d\ude14 I expected better from under armour. I don't know that I will purchase shoes made by them again.

Highly recommend this shoes.", "Loved the color first and foremost. As usual, it's Under Armour, need I say more. Ok, I will! They fit as expected and are perfect as usual. The MOST comfortable brand I've ever owned. They seem durable and have good form. Ive only worn them 2 times so far, but ALL of my other UA sneaks have lasted right until the last rip. And I say rip bc I use the worth out of all my UA until they're not usable any more....and they LAST!!!", "Great shoes for the money so far. Very roomy in the toes, which I think is good.

I wonder if other people have this same problem? He has to always wear black socks underneath so that it doesn't show. Other than that, great UA shoes for a great price!", "These are my first UA shoes.... they fit well. I walk about 17,000 steps a day at school as an advisor. These are super light and comfy.

Fit perfectly, and the mesh let\u2019s my foot breathe. Comfortable insole. Would definitely recommend!", "While these shoes are great; very light and comfortable, they do run very narrow.

I was surprised to find that the shoe is not very comfortable for running and doesn\u2019t have much/any arch support.

Otherwise I love these boots.", "I wanted to get this boot, however, my size was not available in women's. I read the reviews, and most folks said that you needed to order 1/2 size larger at least. I wear a size 10 in women's, and normally I would order a size 8 in men's. I went ahead and ordered a size 8 1/2 in men's. They fit perfectly.

I put on a pair of my athletic socks with these ,and the feel and fit is perfect.", "I normally wear a size 9 in women's shoes.

Since I couldn't find my size in the women's version of the Durand Polar boot, I went with the men's version, and ordered up a full size. It's a good thing I did! These absolutely run small based on the insulation inside the boot. A half size won't do it.", "These boots run small. If you need to use a heavy sock you better get at least one size larger,..maybe more. Otherwise they are a very good boot.

But a very comfortable boot that is light and keeps you warm.", "Great boot, but ORDER A FULL SIZE LARGER THAN USUAL. I own other Keen boots but these were so tight in that size that I actually could not get them on. Fortunately, I have a friend they fit perfectly and who loves them. I reordered a size larger, wear them all the time when outside. The past month the temps here in North Dakota have been consistently fairly cold... ten above to minus 40, and my feet, which tend to get cold, haven't! Boots are also very comfortable and have a foot box much larger than typical European design. Glad to see they're made in Oregon.", "Really good boots.

Thanks Keen and Amazon!", "I own several pairs of Keen boots. I highly recommend them. These Polar Durand have the correct length, but a little tight on top at the toes that will probably stretch out though. Update. Still tight, no stretching, maybe order 1/2 size larger. Also there is a rubber bump under the sole insert inside at the heel. After wearing a couple of weeks, it feels like there is a rock under my heel, can't wear them. Can't return them, Going to see about cutting it out. It's not a defect, it's an oval piece of rubber, and the insert has a small indentation where the oval fits, part of the design, but very uncomfortable.", "Boot definitely needs to be purchased 1/2 size larger than your regular. I appreciate when previous reviewers give me the heads up and they were right on for this one. That being said, I really like the boot so far and it feels like I expect a Keen product to feel and fit. I have recently been buying Keen replacements as I wear other things out and I have liked the results so far.

Light on the feet, flexible, over all great boot.", "Excellent quality and comfort as you would expect from Keen. Heed suggestions to go up a half size. I found this to be true. The toe box is slightly narrower than other Keen's. The only thing preventing this product from a five star is the lack of loop for gaiters. For a winter hiking boot, that omission seems odd.", "I wear a 10.5 Keen boot when to the Keen site they recommended to order a .5 size larger in this boot and glad I did a little tight but after I wore them just one day the loosened up and fit great. Also very warm my feet have never been warmer in the cold Wis weather.", "Agree with the other reviews that these boots run a bit small so I was fortunate to have ordered them a size larger than normal. Have worn a few times out in the snow and they keep my feet warm and dry.

Often when we buy him shoes/boots/sneakers/sandals, we end up having to return and find him something else. However, not with the Keen brand. Now that his foot growth has slowed down a little, we don't mind paying extra.

My foot is not wide. This shoe fits my foot very well. I can see it being a little snug as the toe box approaches but I liked my 1st pair so much I turned around and bought another pair. I use these for HIIT, weight and functional training (push ups, pull ups etc...), and I absolutely love them.

However, for me I wouldn't go a size bigger because I expect them to loosen with wear and I want a snug fit for gym work. They look kind of odd because they are not symmetrical and remind me of soccer shoes with the laces off center for better ball contact. We'll see if that makes a difference with time. Typically, for me, the Asics last fits my foot well and I think I'll like these. I'll try to remember to comment in a couple months after they've had some wear.", "I really did like these shows and wanted them to work, but they're very narrow. I got the size perfect in terms of length, but they were very tight on my through the middle of my foot, and I don't usually need the wide-size in footwear.

Given I workout 6-days per week, I have had more than sufficient time form an opinion. These have withstood my workouts very well. I have high arches and these provide all the support I need for hard sprints and jumping. Traction has been better than I expected -- even on the cinder track where I do my sprint work and, as you might expect, extremely secure on the soft gym surfaces. I would definitely purchase these again, as long as Asics does not change them for the worse.", "When ordering I was somewhat not sure of this color but good thing I ordered this one instead Black.

There is still an ample amount of stability, which is ideal for squatting and the toe box is fairly similar.

I bought them because my Under Armour sneakers just wasn't good for cross fit or lifting. I had some reserves because of the cost being less expensive.

There is no amortization whatsoever, they hit very hard on your knees, terrible to run with them. Very good for weight lifting.", "I wanted to like these shoes, but they are too small and narrow. I bought these shoes in half a size larger than my normal shoe size as other reviewers suggested, but these shoes were still too small and narrow. My toes were sticking out of the side, and the shoe mashed my toes together. I like ASICS as a brand, but their minimalist shoes need work. If you're looking for a minimalist shoe, I recommend checking out Vivobarefoot. Their whole philosophy is barefoot shoes.", "So everyone has their favorite shoe for functional fitness. I love these.

They are on the narrow side - even for me and I have regular/slightly narrow width feet. I like that she shoes are super light, I hardly notice I'm wearing them. Would definitely buy again.", "These shoes are excellent for weight training and general exercise in the gym. They have a solid base that is stable during squats and a low stack height with minimal heel drop so you are closer to the ground for deadlifts.

Super light, comfortable, waterproof and stayed dry hiking in snow and wet mud all weekend long, and the grip excellent. I love them.", "Bought these boots 2 weeks before a trekking trip to Patagonia. I had serious doubts. Were they up to the task. Also, I had no time to break in. Almost 100 kilometers later I had no foot issues. They handled the harsh terrain flawlessly. I brought a backup pair of Solomon boots which was totally wasted weight as I never wore them once. Buy these boots with confidence. They will deliver.", "I use them to hike and walk my dog in all conditions and they\u2019ve held up great so far. I\u2019ve logged about 60+ miles in them so far. These boots are very waterproof without using any treatment on them. Because they are so waterproof, I did notice that my feet do sweat a decent amount, but that\u2019s the only issue I have with them. I have a wider foot and they fit perfect.", "1. They run a little large. I ordered 1/2 size smaller than normal and they fit perfectly with thick wool socks. My foot is normal width, not wide. 2. The \u201cRich Brown\u201d is MUCH lighter than pictured. It is more of a walnut than brown. The boots pictured have probably been treated with the Danner Boot Dressing which will darken them some. See my pictures for comparison. Keep in mind this is immediately after I applied the Danner Boot Dressing so it is shiny any wet looking. 3. The leather is soft as is the sole. There is no break in needed. They are wearable all day on the first day without worrying about blisters.", "Fits great and looks great, love it right? Okay, not so fast. Not waterproof, not even water resistant. I did two Danner Waterproofing on it and thought okay, could walk through some wet grass. About 100 feet in my socks were soaked!!! On the other side, it does not breath, at all, not even a little. After an hour walk my feet are sweat-soaked and this in mild temps . . . I have several other Danners which range form maybe two star to 5 star, but this is a zero. I have to say I have not had the issues with Redwing/IrishSetter that I have had with Danners but that is a separate story.", "Excellent hiking boot! Bought these for my boyfriend a couple days before leaving to Peru for 2 weeks, and was quite nervous about the fit. He tried on many boots around town but didn\u2019t really fall in love with any he saw in stores... so we took a gamble on these. He\u2019s worn them almost everyday of our trip and loves them! They are incredibly water proof\u2014 tested in the rainy season in the highlands of Peru!", "Great boot. I have had them for several months. I have hiked in the high deserts of Southern California & trudged through mud in the warm Montana ranches. They are waterproof. Water will bead off boot right up to the top of the tongue. Once you have submerged them fully in water the interior part of the boot has a liner that keep the water in the boot. But easy fix is to take boot off, Drain the water and your good to go. I would buy this boot again.", "After about 4 months of use I really like these boots. I'm a 10.5 so based on other reviews I ordered a size 10 and fits just right. Summer time hikes these boots are very warm but fall time they're perfect. I've traversed ankle deep water and they have stayed completely dry every time. They squeaked a lot when I first got them and slowly gone away as they've worn in. I got them on sale so price wise I recommend them. There's dozens of other boots available, some are probably better some worse. I chose these for style, decent reviews, and brand name. I've only done day hikes but I like them", "I selected the Full Grain leather. Instead of receiving a nice smooth polishable full grain leather I received a velvet leather textured boot. EVEN the photo on the BOX shows the lighter smooth leather, so I requested a replacement thinking they were in the wrong box. NOPE!! Got the replacements and they're the same. It appears Danner No longer sells the smooth full grain leather. If you're looking for a boot you can put polish on to get the rock scuffs out this isn't the boot to buy. Comfort wise, they're very nice. But at an almost $200 price point, they better be....", "Fit well. Feels like walking in well cushioned hi top tennis shoes. Very good traction in mud and slush. Have to see how they hold up over time. Sole wears rapidly. Pretty well shot after a year total usage. Gets very warm at temperatures above 70 F. The Danner Dry liner acts like insulation and feet sweat profusely.", "I love the look and fit of these. I bought two pairs! As others have noted, they are not for warm weather- ZERO breathability, which can be great in cooler weather. They feel great to wear. Not especially lightweight, but heavy. My main complaint is that they are not wearing any better than boots 1/2 the price. I've worn mine only a few days a month, taken great care with both cleaning and recommended maintenance applications, but they are both showing signs of cheaper construction/materials than expected. Buy them because you like the look, just don't expect them to be more durable than a more average shoe.", "Just bought my third pair of these Mountain 600 4.5\u201d Danners. I have very wide feet (8.5 EEE), so when I find a pair of boots that fit (8.5 wide), I usually stick with them until the manufacturer discontinues them. Since most footwear is made overseas, the companies have all dropped letter widths, so it\u2019s difficult to know how they will fit until you try them on. I love these boots, they fit well, are built rugged enough to last at least a year of daily use. The laces are also great, in that they stay tied.", "I don\u2019t know about everyone else, but I generally expect new hiking boots that haven\u2019t been previously hiked in...boots came very clearly used. Review is in now way a representation of boot quality or fit, but a review of seller. Super disappointed. I reread the product description 3 times when they arrived to make sure I didn\u2019t miss something. Nope, just got duped by seller.", "Hated to give two stars but...the big miss on these boots is the Danner Dry liner. It does NOT breathe. I did a five mile hike in cool weather temp in the high 60's and my socks were soaked at the end. Then did a 10 mile hike and got caught in rain. My feet stayed dry for about 3 miles. By mile 5 I had water and bubbles coming out of the seams with each sloggy squishy step. Very unhappy with the Danner Dry. The boot are very comfortable, and would be great for wearing everyday. Hey are like hiking in shoes with boot support.", "LOVE these boots. For work I am required to wear ankle high boots and there are days I have to spend 12 hours on my feet. I am a 60 year old heavy woman with a wide foot. I normally wear Keens but the heals wear down too quickly. Time will tell how these wear but they were comfortable right out of the box and can bring me through a long day without aching feet. They do hold moisture so on cold days I wear sock liners which help a lot, as well I bought a 2nd pair to alternate daily between the pairs, pulling the insoles out when I get home to let them thoroughly dry.", "Wow these Danner boots feel amazing. Normally wear a size 12 and sized down a half size as recommended by Danner. Perfect fit. Like many others, I was surprised as to the color of the \u201crich brown\u201d as the actual boot does not match the picture. I also purchase some Danner clear boot dressing and prior to even wearing the boots I slapped a coat on. Love the color much more and more representative of the actual picture. Hope this review helped some folks.", "The shoe fits is slightly loose with summer-weight socks but just right for winter-weight socks. Good traction and sturdy build for protection. Because it is all leather it makes the feet hot when walking about when the temperature is in the high 70s and above. It laces up tight but the boot is easy to remove. The laces are overly long and even with a double knot there is lots of lace hanging about.", "Runs about 1/2 size big, roomy toe box. Had to return my original order and get 1/2 size down. Bought these for day hikes. Took them up to the Smokys for a weekend trip and they were comfy out the box. No hot spots after we got going and 20 miles later they are formed perfectly to my feet. Waterproofing did as advertised. Walked through a shallow creek and plenty of puddles and mud. Stayed dry. Also ran under faucet when I got them and and they stayed dry inside. Grip seemed fine on all surfaces wet and dry. Not too heavy or clunky. They look pretty good too. My first Danner boot and I\u2019m satisfied with my purchase.", "Been buying cheap boots for a few years, no clue why. Best boots I have owned, hands down. Soooooo much lighter than I expected, which was a nice surprise. Metal loops and clasps (which I love and missed on my cheap boots) Have walked through multiple streams, winter use in the PNW (rain) Just an absolute joy for an everyday hiking boot. I'm done buying cheap boots. Danner from now on. Someday when my kid stops growing out of shoes before we even pay for them, I'll get him a pair.", "These are the most comfortable pair of boots that I have ever owned. I have had Timberland and RedWing and in the comfort categories they are not even in the same Leauge. Vibrant sole also has excellent grip in all conditions so far. The sizing is a bit large but it says so in the description. I am normally a 12.5/13 and a 12 fit perfectly.", "Boots are wicked comfortable and feel great. I took them on two 12 mike hikes the first week I got them. I do have one complaint and that\u2019s why I\u2019ll be returning them. They started to SQUEAK after the first hike. Wearing them around the house was fine, walking the dogs was fine, but after the first hike they start squeaking and won\u2019t stop. It only gets louder. Especially when you\u2019re away from all the noises and trying to enjoy nature. Sorry, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend these boots to any friend of mine. Google Danner squeaky boots. It\u2019s not an uncommon issue.", "Everything is really nice, the quality is great. The only negative thing that I would say about them is that there is a small amount of padding around the ankles, and sense I\u2019ve sprained both my ankles before they get a little sore after I\u2019ve had them on for a few hours, but that\u2019s nothing that a thick pair of wool socks can\u2019t fix. So it\u2019s just something to consider.", "I bought these boots mid 2017. I've been on a few great hikes and I wear them regularly in the winter, but not in the summer. Recently I noticed that they were literally coming apart at the seams. Granted they are not new, but a pair of boots should last longer than a year and a half, particularly if they aren't worn year round. I've owned a pair of Merrills and I've hiked for years in them and they are still in decent shape. I expected more from the US made Danner's.", "I can wear the Danner 600 4.5\" boot on trails and to the movies. Very comfortable, supportive and a good fit. I experienced little need for break-in. There is a lot of debate over what size to order for these boots. I wear a mens 9 most of the time and very occasionally need to go to a 9.5. The 9 fit me well with enough room for heavier socks.", "Am very pleased with the Danner Mountain 600 hiking boots. Very comfortable. Fit pretty close to what I expected. Good ankle support. Vibram soles work well and don't seem to grab when not desired. Did not hurt or cause a blister on first hike! I am guessing that they mostly were broken in within the first 35 miles probably much before. Am approaching 100 miles already on boots and pleased. Also have a pair of Danner Wildland Fire Boots which I really like. Delivery was as expected. Bottom line: NO COMPLAINTS, HAPPY!", "These are the most comfortable boots I have ever worn and they hold up very well. I have worn them for 6 months at work where I walk on steel grating that is like saw teeth. My Keen boots would be worn out by now but these show very little wear. The only negative is they do not breath making for very sweaty feet. I have to wear wicking socks and I have 2 pairs of the boots that I alternate daily.", "PROS: Wide, no pressure on side of feet. no squeezing. fits comfortably in the front of shoe \"megagrip\" vibram - the best ice and rock traction i have had Cons: very boxy fit on the ankle. super wide ankle. wide shoes are for the foot, not for an ankle that is huge. I would return these if I could!!!! Back of heel is very low cut so not really a boot in the back -- this lets dirt and water in.", "Wow! First pair of Danners and holy hell, most comfortable boot I have ever worn straight out of the box. Took out for my a 5 mile hike test and they worked great. Was afraid they we're going to be painful and maybe hurt in some places as I broke them in.... NOPE! They literally take very little to no time to break in. They definitely are true to size, and I swear I've been wearing them when I don't hike. That's how comfortable they are. I was lucky because they were on sale for like $110 and pulled the trigger. If you're on the fence about these, don't! BUY BUY BUY!", "First let me say. I love Danner boots. I have six pair and each has a specific use. This was to be just for walking. It fits great, comfy and was cheap compared to my other Danners. Two things knock this down. First it you walk and start to sweat, your feet will be soaked AND overheated. This does NOT breath at all. Second, they are NOT waterproof. I sprayed Danner waterproofing on them and figured good to go. No. A walk through 4\" wet grass had my feet soaked within 25'. They also seriously discolored as well. So, these are now relegated to around the house type use.", "Excellent boots. Light weight and great cushion. Good traction. Are definitely waterproof. A little too waterproof. As other reviewers have said, this proprietary membrane does not breath very well. First boots I\u2019ve ever owned that I find tops of my socks wet from moisture trying to escape. I live in southern Colorado so it\u2019s not too bad. But in more humid climates you might think twice if you\u2019re a large sweaty mammal like myself. I might spend more for Danners with Gore Tex next time.", "I walked in these about 10 miles before hiking to break them in a little bit. My previous hiking footwear was a trail shoe and before that, a solomon x ultra 3. This tops those by comfort by far. Lighter than the full boot and much more comfortable/confident on the trail than the trail shoe. The moderate ankle support does the job. I don't travel with really heavy loads 30lbs or so for day hikes. But these performed fantastic up mount washington and mt moosilaukee. These will be a must in my hiking footware from now on. I love these things.", "This is a great boot! It is comfortable out of the box and requires almost no break-in. I've used it for a variety of hikes over the last 6 weeks, ranging from walking my dog in the neighborhood to several day-long hikes through the mountains of Southwestern PA with a daypack. It probably is not a great boot for carrying a heavy pack or for extended hiking in deep snow, but it is fantastic for almost everything else.", "I just wore these for 8 days of hiking in the rain in Iceland and the boots were awesome. I spent most of the time in rainy conditions, marching over wet rocks, mud and/or cliff edges. I never slipped once. My feet stayed dry even while standing for a while in shallow streams to take pictures. They were also comfortable from start to finish without any need to be broken in. I am a very happy customer Danner. Thank you for the awesome boots!", "I love these boots, they are very comfortable and durable, zero issues in 8 months. True to size, and worth the money. Since i bough these i have bought two more pairs of danner boots, one set of steel toe work boots and one set of hunting boots. Both are holding up just as well and are very comfortable. I spend alot of time on my feet, and used to go through boots and shoes every 6 months. These have exceeded that and look and feel like they have alot more life left in them.", "My first pair of hiking boots owned. I had tried these on locally to get a feel for their sizing and they do size a bit large (normally wear 10.5, but sized these as 10) The fit is very roomy and they are incredibly comfortable. I have yet to wear them on the trail so I can't speak of their performance there. So far just wearing them around town I can say the Vibram sole seems to grip very well is wet conditions, and the quality of craftsmanship appears to live up to the Danner reputation. Will be putting to the test in later weeks.", "These boots look like old school hiking boots but they are lightweight and high tech. I am training to hike up Mt. St. Helens and have been hiking 3-5 miles a day for two months in theses boots and they were comfortable right out of the box. There was no break-in required. The soles are grippy accept on smooth tile which is not what they are made for. The soles grip well on rocky and muddy surfaces. I plan to always have a pair of these Danner Hikers in my outdoor footwear collection! Well worth the money!", "When they arrived, the sole's looked clean, but the rest of the boot's look like they have been worn before. And now for the extras. In the left boot was an old, empty, prescription glass case. In the left boot was an old manicure set, a bi-fold with a zipper. We can't forget that in both boots were an old-fashioned shoe horns. You know, the wooden kind that expand. No lie. Have two witnesses. After finishing this, looking into a return. And yes, the shoe horns will go back with the boots. (Really, can't make this stuff up) First negative transaction with Amazon.", "An older Scoutmaster recommended these boots from his long ago treks. He mentioned Danner was at one time one of the most recommended boots for Philmont. Our son broke them in fine and reported they were a life saver on his 118 mile Trek at Philmont. They came back looking very worn and our son's feet were well protected and in good shape. He said these were comfortable the whole trip and that they would probably be his choice again if he returns as a Scout leader someday to Philmont.", "I'm on my feet all day, have always worn a hiking type boot for the support. These are worth the price; I purchased 4 pair, various colors. I rotate my boots daily to air out and extend the life of the boot. I wore Danner Ft Lewis leather boots pretty much my last 10 years in the military. Danner knows boots", "These are durable boots, but not really very comfortable. Long break-in time and still not real comfortable. As someone else stated, the slick liner on the inside makes my feet sweat more than normal. I got these when they were on sale and would buy them again. Good quality for the price but comfort is lacking compared to my other boots. I will say these have a pretty good design for mountain hiking EXCEPT that the liner makes my feet sweat significantly more than normal.", "Two Words if you are unsure, BUY THESE!! To start I am a big guy. 6'3 350lbs. It's hard for me to find a good boot with maximum support. I'm on my feet walking on asphalt 10-12hrs a day. So far these have been great. I suffer from arthritis in my right knee. These provide all day comfort while looking great at the same time. **\"Side note*** I'm normally 13EE or 13 wide. These run big!! With these I was able to order 13D and they were perfect! I'm officially a Danner Fan", "I really like these boots. They're stylish and comfortable. I can wear to work and not look like I just stepped out of the woods. I've worn these on a 10 mile hike and they did not disappoint in terms of performance. The only complaint I have is that they're not really breathable and your feet tend to feel a little swampy if you're doing a lot of walking. I attribute this to the waterproof membrane, which works great by the way. So, you're taking the good with the bad. If these boots used Gore-Tex or some other high tech material for waterproofing, they'd probably be north of $300. For the price, they're a really nice boot.", "Danger mountain 600 in suede is a very comfortable shoe right out of the box. I steeped into some grass that was saturated with water, boots kept me dry! They stayed dry but the suede repelled the water but not the dirt. Dirt clung to the suede and just wiped it of with a rag and good as new! They fit large so I dozed a half-dozen down btw. The only issue I had with the boots was the tongue or hardware for laces were hitting my ankle bone every time I took a step retired many times same issue.", "I followed the size instruction and the fit was good but they felt hard and were hard on the bottom of my feet. I tried an insole but it seemed to cram the top of my feet higher into the top of the shoe. I returned them and ordered the Danner Men's South Rim 600 4.5\" Hiking Boot and what is funny, the Danner Men's South Rim 600 4.5\" Hiking Boot runs large? Anyway the Danner Men's South Rim 600 4.5\" Hiking Boot are like walking on air! Just my opinion!..", "These boots held up really well after a week trip full of hiking on rough, steep, rocky, wet terrain. My feet never got wet, and were comfortable in temps in the 50's and low 60's. I didn't bring another pair of shoes, so I only wore these the entire time and was always comfortable. They look great, and wear fine even when around town with jeans.", "I have no complaints. Used the sizing tool and was nervous because it put me in a D and my other boots are usually EE. The boots fit great. The boots are very comfortable. They are a lot lighter than I expected. So far I have only worn them a few times. They have excellent grip in the snow and ice and dry. I will be doing some hiking this summer and am looking forward to it.", "On first glance the boots were much lighter than I expected. I took them out of the box and took a 3 mile walk. The next day I walked 3 1/2 miles. Very comfortable and my feet did not hurt after the walk. I\u2019m not sure I would do this with most boots. Usually I would wear new boots in short bursts just to break in. I\u2019m not sure how they\u2019ll hold up. Time will tell but so farm I\u2019m pretty impressed with my first pair of Danner\u2019s.", "I wear a lot of boots, and they\u2019re almost all waterproof. I\u2019ve owned Oboz, Merrell, Keen, Teva, Sorrel, Red Wings, and these Danners are by far the hottest, least breathable boots I\u2019ve ever worn. All of my other boots breathe fine, but these feel like they\u2019re lined with plastic bags. My foot is constantly hot, sweating and wet. My foot stayed so wet with sweat, in fact, that I contracted athletes foot for the first time ever. It\u2019s a shame, because I really like these boots and they are amazingly comfortable, but I just can\u2019t weae them because they\u2019re so hot.", "So first off these are the most comfortable shoes I've owned, I also live the way the boots look it gives that vintage look. One con about these boots after 1;week of wearing them is that oil stains the shoes, I work in a Walmart parking lot and step through a lot of oily puddles. However they are boots and are meant to get dirty so I really don't care that much just something to keep in mind. Other than that these are probably my most favorite shoes I've ever owned, money well spent.", "High Quality. Great. Amazing. Awesome. Super cool. Fashionable. Durable. Comfortable. Waterproof. You get your money\u2019s worth. Best boots I\u2019ve ever owned. I wear them hiking and around the farm. I live part-time in Brooklyn, so they\u2019re great for urban walking too. I also wear them as rain and snow boots. To top it off, I get tons of compliments.", "For those worried about color, attached are pictures of the Rich Brown boots right out of the box, with one boot treated, and both after obenaufs LP cream. I didn\u2019t care about the color so treated it for added protection and it got very dark. Otherwise, fits true enough to size, seems well constructed, and the sole has a nice firm cushion. Only concern is with the foam padded insides of the upper being slightly stiff - hopefully that loosens up as they get worn in (been a while since I\u2019ve had new boots). First impression is good, will see if they hold up to hikes, weather, and wear.", "Although my use is mostly around the office, and not much hiking, I do wear these daily. My prior choices in boots would be showing significant wear at 6 months and needing replacement before 1 yr. These boots still look and feel great. My only complaint is auditory. Somewhere in one of them plastic is squeaking slightly on every step. No one comments on it, but I can hear it.", "I purchased my first pair of these from another outlet and loved them right out of the box and thought I'd pick up another pair and checked Amazon and wow! what a savings over my first pair from the brick and mortar store, I should've shopped at Amazon first as I would've saved almost 50%. This second pair from Amazon was just as comfortable and will meet my needs as light hikers and again they seem very comfortable right out of the box which is rare with most shoes I've bought in the past. I do indeed recommend these to other buyers.", "Love these boots! I was a bit nervous as they were just ever so slightly tight around the balls of my feet at first (I have wide feet but got these in regular). They however took about 4 hours to break in and they are so perfect, no tightness. I am a heavy set person so to find shoes I can walk in for hours and have no foot pain is so amazing. Highly recommend. Plus side they are really cute and I get lots of compliments.", "I am a huge Danner fan, I've been wearing for almost 10 years. I have bought a lot of different brands trying to find a comfortable/stable/ long wear/durable boot. A friend from my time in the military turned me on to this brand and I've been wearing ever since. Need I say more. The fit (as long as you KNOW your foot/feet size and width)is perfect. I would recommend to anyone . Aesthetically pleasing", "This is my second pair of danners recently I have sent back. Both for the same reason - the sole is coming unglued in several places. Doesn't give a good vibe that even if I get this boot without a defect, that it will actually last a long time. I have some old danners that are great boots, but anything new I have bought has been crap. Outsourcing to foreign countries is ruining the reputation this company was known for. On a positive note, the boot did feel good...more like a shoe than a boot.", "I have owned Danner boots in the past...just in work boots style, and it has been several years since I've worn them regularly. Because of a foot problem, I was in search of a really comfortable boot that also gave good support. I found that exact boot in this model. They are not the kind of hiking boot I would take on a grueling multi-mile hike, but they are perfect for every day use. I will be buying a second pair.", "Never owned Danners, had a pair of Vasque that finally bit the dust after 15 years. Always heard good things about Danner tho so I thought it was worth the risk especially at the price ($50). I've only worn these a few times but the are very comfortable. They wear like an athletic shoe and the support is great with the addition of some beefier insoles.", "A lightweight boot. If that's what you're looking for, am sure this will work. Won't replace a solid full leather upper backpacking boot for me, but is a nice alternative to a hiking shoe.", "Very comfortable with little support (which is what I wanted), excellent traction soles, very light and nice classic look. Just two minor complains: I have very wide feet, so I ordered 10 extra wide. However the boots were still tight for me on the sides, so I removed the insoles and that fix the problem. The other issue is the leather which is very soft and get badly scratch in rocky terrain. I have had to put some epoxy on the front of the boot so it prevents further damage.", "These are probably the most comfortable hiking boots I've worn. Switched from my usual merrell's to these after reading great things. The vibram sole is really durable, the lacing structure is well designed, and on top of everything else they look great. Note: your feet will likely get a little hot in warmer weather, but that's to be expected with pretty much any waterproof boot.", "I have other Danner boots in this size that fit perfectly (14W). This boot was at least two sizes too big. I'm guessing that it was some sort of glitch? Returning boots. Tough to buy shoes without trying them on. At least Amazon offers free returns. Nice boots. I wish they fit. I need a light pair of hikers.", "I work in landscaping, so this is my opinion. Great boots, and super comfy! I have used Solomon boots for a long time, but decided t make a switch because over the past couple of years the solomons I have wore have been wearing out sooner and sooner. These boots are light and comfy, but I haven\u2019t put them through months of use. One thing I can say is; they are on the warmer side during summer months. They are really good at keeping your feet dry in wet conditions, but don\u2019t breath all that well. I usually bring a pair of socks to change out during a hard works day.", "bougfht this boot to Iceland trip.wear it the first time and walked all day in city 18k steps exploring around. broken in right away basically,just a little of toe rub at first then it went away. then did a glacier hiking 5 hours,volcano steep hill climbing,no issues at all..comfortable and grippy. great product!", "First impressions after two weeks of use. Really comfortable. Well made. Liking them a lot. Have a coworker with the same boots that are a couple years old. He loves his, and I can see why; They're a great pair of boots that from the look of it, last well too. I like them so much I might order another pair just to save for the future!", "Amazing boots. Didn't take a long break in like danners I've worn before. These are extremely light but feel secure enough to protect my feet on long hikes. Vibram sole is amazing and grips well. Haven't tested the waterproof ability fully but they did well in moderate rain. Great boots for anything outdoors while being very stylish.", "Fit me a quarter size bigger which I like. I normally wear a 9 in an everyday walk around shoe, 9.5-10 in running shoes so I got the 9.5 fits perfect. Pretty light weight, I would buy these boots again.", "These are legit hiking boots. So stylish and actually useful. Got them for my boyfriend originally in a 10 (his normal size) even after reading that they run a half size too large. My line of thought was that usually you buy hiking shoes a half size bigger to accommodate feet swelling, etc. However, they were way bigger than even that, in his opinion. I exchanged for a 9.5 (again, he is a 10) and they were a perfect fit with plenty of room in the toe box. Highly recommend these boots! Just note the size!", "I have had many boots, shoes, etc... over my 50 years on the Earth and these are the best I've ever worn. They are the lightest and most comfortable boot! I've only had them for a little over a week, so I can't judge their durability just yet, but since they are Danner's, I'm sure they will withstand the test of time. As far as comfort, they are top notch and I recommend them to anyone who has never experienced walking on a cloud.", "If you like danners already, these are built as well and have the same sturdy, old school feel. If you don\u2019t have any danners, get these as a \u201cgateway boot\u201d , you\u2019ll be hooked. While the low lacing makes my big flipper feet look smaller, and are easy on/off, they are a bit warm for all day inside wearing. In others words, they are real boots and not fashion boots.", "I walk 3 to 5 miles every day in a country urban setting. Through a park, along a river, down a dirt road and back the terrain is cement sidewalk, pavement, dirt, loose gravel. The traction on these boots are great, the support is great, and they continue to get better. Thanks Danner. Edit: I really like these boots! I wear my 1st pair thru dust/dirt/mud almost every day so I bought a 2nd pair, brown suede red laces, to wear on clean surfaces. They feel like I'm wearing pillows on my feet! <3", "I\u2019m giving these a 5 star rating despite the fact they made my ankles bleed from chaffing. The first time I put them on I was amazed at how comfortable they were. Then I started walking in them. Horrible, absolutely horrible. They hurt so much around the ankles from the tops breaking in. Now that I\u2019ve finally broken them in I can say they\u2019re the most comfortable boots I\u2019ve ever owned.", "These are the best hiking boots I've ever, ever worn. And I've gone through a few. That includes Danner's venerable and all-time classic Mountain Light II boots. These are some hybrid of the most rugged cross-training shoe you can think of attached to a Danner boot body. Light, adaptable, insanely comfortable. I'd put these in the \"ultralight\" category of outdoor apparel. So, if you're into products that fall into that category, these are the best you can get. Also, they just look really, really cool.", "Despite the reviews saying order one size down, these fit true to size. I am a 12, ordered an 11.5 based on Danner and every ones comments here on ordering a whole sized down. The 11.5 was too small. They are not sturdy, offer little support at all, for serious hiking. Great looking boot if you want the retro late 70's early 80's hiker look.", "Leather is nicer than expected. I usually wear a size 10 in most sneakers. Ordered these in 9.5 and they fit perfectly. Full grain leather is recommended.", "Gorgeous boots with what looks and feels like top-rated craftsmanship but the width is completely off. It is narrow enough to feel like a regular width (not wide) and one size smaller. Even narrower than the Danner were Timberland boots. After trying several boots, the one true wide fit are the Skechers.", "I really like these boots. They're very comfortable from the start and required absolutely no break-in. I rolled the dice and ordered a half size smaller based on some other reviews and they fit perfectly...so, they do run about a half-size too big. Some other reviews mentioned reliability but they seem well made so time will tell I guess...", "This boot is the Portland Select full grain leather version, made in the USA. I went with this one, because the other version is suede, and i read that people feared those might wear out on them much sooner than they would hope. These full grain leather boots seem very durable. They are surprisingly out-of-the-box comfortable, but will still break in and be more comfortable. Good bang for buck (i got them for about $60.00), especially for a pair of danners, which can get really pricey. The MegaGrip out sole is really cool and good for staying upright on slippy surfaces. Came with extra pair of shoelaces to match the blue leather...", "Received these on Friday and laced them up and set out Saturday morning for an almost 10 mile trek antler hunting in Western Wyoming. I kept anticipating some sort of discomfort, slip, pinch or soreness from a boot being not properly broken in. None whatsoever! Encountered alot if very vertical/side slope conditions which they gave unreal support on for 215 pound man. Very waterproof while trekking in oftentimes knee deep snow with waterproof gaiters. Excited to get back at it again this weekend!", "I returned these but they're a good boot. I have a normal size 10.5 foot but the toe box was too small, heightwise. Other than the fit though, the boot appears to be made of top quality materials and is put together with precision. If you get a pair that fits you'll be happy them.", "Very comfortable right out of the box. On Danner\u2019s website it states that the Mountain 600 style of boost run big and it is suggested to go down 1/2 size from what you normally wear. However, I found this was NOT true in my case. I would suggest you order your regular size and do not go down a 1/2 size.", "Good so far. Only worked on them a week. I work maintenance at a hospital, and they been fine. I haven\u2019t been enough water to know if they are really \u201cwater proof\u201d. No break in. I thought that they would be darker and shinny. Not thrilled about the suede look. Also hard to tighten toe box. But feel good. Feet get a little sweaty if socks are great. Let\u2019s see in 6months how they will hold up.", "I love these boots! Super comfy, feels like I'm wearing running shoes even after being on my feet all day. A note on sizing: they run a little big per Danner. I wear an 11W in most other footwear, went down half a size to 10.5W, perfect fit. Good for general daily use and light hiking. Had them for several months now, holding up well. Treated them with suede cleaner and waterproofer from Nikwax a few times, still looking fresh.", "I take a 12.5 r - these were on Amazon warehouse at great savings but they were 12 w. The wide was no problem and going 1/2 size down is the only way to go as the boots run big. The top of my foot seemed too roomy - this was an easy fix with a magnet cushion insert", "These are the most comfortable boots I\u2019ve ever owned (next to maybe some Doc Martens), and I wear them so much I KonMari\u2019d out a pair of black Timberland boots and a pair of Merrell hiking boots. No break-in time, waterproof, and equally stylish on Boulder\u2019s Flatirons and downtown San Francisco (among others, so far).", "Could be my favorite footwear I have ever owned. Wore them fresh out of the box for a camping trip in Sequioa National Park and did about 7 full hours of hiking combined. Not a single blister on my feet. Amazing grip, definitely waterproof. Breathable. Great fit and all around comfort. Definitely recommened. I wear a 11.5 in Nike running/training shoes and wore 11 in these Danners and fits great", "Great hiking shoes. I wore them on the 30 mile Eagle Rock Loop in Arkansas. My only complaint was when I had to cross a couple of rivers and ended up getting my feet soaked. I should have changed into my water shoes. But the shoes are really comfortable, great for hiking long hikes up hill or flat. Agility isn't impaired, and good ankle support.", "For a long time I have been a fan of synthetic materials and all the new stuff on the market but Danner nailed it with these leather boots. They're very light weight, much more than I expected. They are also very comfortable and seem to be very durable. I would very much recommend these boots to anyone.", "They appear to be of quality construction, the only thing is they do take a bit of breaking in. I couldn\u2019t wear them all day for the 1st 1/2 dozen times wearing them but once broken in I LIKE them...", "Most of my 8\" work boots are Danners so I wanted to give these hikers a try. Overall a nice pair of boots, definitely not as nice as the work boots unfortunately. Stitching is strong, tread is sturdy.", "Its one of the expensive boots I ever bought. I like hiking every now and then but my feet condition (heel spur) would get worse as regular hiking boots are heavier. This boot is light as a feather. The only thing I did not like about it is the color (grey). Other than that I recommend it. It is also US made so supports local industry.", "Im on my feet all day. Marine vet and 14 years of law enforcement. I go from my danner tactical boots to these after work on the weekends. You cannot go wrong with Danner. You 100% get what you pay for in quality, comfort, reliability and customer service. Do yourself and them feet a favor and order you a pair.", "I red a lot of reviews before I got these. They are more comfortable than I expected!!! I just had got a pair of Oakley boots, and they are ok, but no where near as comfortable at these. I had a pair of Nike boots that I needed to replace, and I was not going to buy Nike again, I got these and I wear them every day all day and my feet have never been uncomfortable in these. I hope they last a long time, because I really like them!!! Great boot!!", "Had to return boots that were to small. Exchanged for a 10.5 size. Fix right out of the box. Discovered that my left foot toe was still slightly rubbing, went to investigate on the web. Found out from REI.com that I was lacing my boots to tight.", "I\u2019ve purchased Danner boots before. I figured this would be a good quality product, but it\u2019s poor and I\u2019m returning them. There is no arch support. The removable insert is a joke. Again, no arch support. There is also a seam right on the metatarsal bone that is extremely uncomfortable.", "I love the boots, they fit great, but someone fumbled the color. The boots I received are the \"Sandy Suede\" color, not the \"Rich Brown\". I can take pictures and all that, but I'm not too concerned. I needed boots, these were a good deal...and I'll probably need another pair in 6 months. I'm just glad the writer of the description wasn't completely color blind, sending me blue suede boots, or something like that. These will get the job done, and they're very comfortable so far.", "They fit like the other Danner boots I've owned. Just a bit snug in the toe area, but comfortable. In fact these are pretty comfortable out of the box. No obvious defects. Obviously can't comment on longevity or water proof claims. But I'll be back.", "Loved these boots from day 1. Unfortunately after less than 2 years they soak up water and the seams that run along the side (to give you flew when walking) are starting to split in multiple locations. Just not the quality I'm used to especially for the price.", "My husband wanted these because he loves Danner. They are incredibly comfortable and true to size. The are high quality craftsmanship and the wear holds up well. The price was good and the delivery on time. Danner is a great product.", "Fits smaller for me. I had to size up a half a size. Better for day hikes but appears some people have done more and gotten away with it. Great grip when climbing some boulders but my feet did get hot easily. I warn them on hot days and my feet sweat profusely. In cold days, not so bad. I would recommend.", "As other reviews have stated, these fit somewhat large, so I'd recommend buying a full size smaller than you normally do. I wear a 11.5 or 12 usually and I was very happy with size 11. I wore them on two day hikes before a 3 day backpacking trip and they wore great. Minimal 'break-in' time needed. Quality shoe. My sister has this style in women's and loves hers also.", "Don't like to buy shoes online (who does, right?) but these fit very well and are extremely comfortable. I have some foot problems due to injuries and have a hard time finding a shoe that is comfortable to wear. These feel really fine with good support and not pinching toes.", "Fits great and the break-in time was less than two days. In the past 4 months I have tried 4 different brands looking for the perfect hiker, including Teva, which absolutely suck; Columbia, which were decent and Timberline, which were just ok. These are by far the most durable (completely soaked crossing a couple of rivers) and the most comfortable. Well worth the cost!", "Great boots, feel like sneakers and I didn\u2019t need any break in period. Put them through a couple 5-9 mile hikes and they\u2019ve worked perfectly. They\u2019re so much lighter than a lot of the options out there and the soles really help in preventing fading. The only gripe I have is the white midsole, but I wanted the full grain upper.", "The Danner Mountain 600 is a good looking, comfortable hiker. 4 stars because the lacing on the left shoe is a little larger than the right shoe, so the fit is a little different for each foot. Not the best quality control on the shoes.", "Bought these back in October and have worn them everyday since.These kept my feet super warm all winter long.Super comfortable,like an athletic shoe and required no break in.Even wore these everyday to work because of the slip resistance of the sole.Now it finally happened,they split on one of the seams.Thank goodness I have a second pair.Vant comment on whether it was my rough treatment or a design flaw,either way would buy again and again", "Overall I think these are very good boots. My only two complaints thus far are the quality of the tongue and the lacing system is a bit old-fashioned/out of date. They fit my wide feet great and are comfortable and sturdy. I will happily use these for years to come.", "Danner boots are great build and this version is very comfortable. Like the looks. So let's talk about problems I face. I am keeping this and enjoy wearing it. - I took wide size but it seems b/w regular and wide. Bit narrow for wide size. - breathability is not that great. I get sweaty feet. I use this mostly for city and weekend walks so works ok for me. - I walked in snow in this boot and some parts of leather socked. (Feet never got wet). The dwr coat was not even on a brand new shoe.. I got a dwr gel from dinner instead of going through the return process for new piece.", "Great boot, most comfortable boot of the six pairs I bought to try. However, these make my feet over pronate, which has never happened before in any work boot I've ever bought. Returned because of that. Would seem to be perfect for those that supination issues.", "I like them a lot. They are built to last and light on my feet. I\u2019ve had several pairs of Danner boots and I\u2019ve never been dissatisfied with their performance and looks.", "I despise buying footwear. My feet are weird and they always hurt. These boots are awesome. Buy a half size down. If you're a wide, get a wide; I did and they're perfect. My favorite shoes to date.", "These are my first pair of hiking boots that I've ever purchased and I was a bit skeptical, but all of my previous hikes were in a pair of athletic shoes, and every time afterward I swore that I would buy a pair of hiking boots. I wore these on a trip to Yosemite and didn't take another pair of shoes (except for sandals). These shoes were so comfortable to wear around the camp and they especially felt secure while hiking!", "These boots are aesthetically excellent. I loved the look, colors, materials etc. but I found the same issue another reviewer noted. There was a spot on the inside seam closest to the big toe that rubbed my foot really bad. It looks like where the two pieces of leather were sewen together it created a very thick protruding seam. I could feel the seem pushing into my foot even just sitting in a chair not even walking. I reaaly wanted to talk myself into keeping these. But in the end they were just too uncomfortable.", "These are great. Very comfy. I bought a 13 because I didn't want to be crowded in there in case they run small, but they definitely don't. This does give me some room for thick socks though! Great traction, excellent waterproofing, good looking.", "Lovely boot for the snow. I\u2019ve been using these in the snow for a week straight and the grip has been fantastic for walking around. I would recommend half a size smaller. I originally bought true to fit size but it was way too big so half a size smaller was perfect.", "Great boots so far. Went on a couple hikes now. Great traction and comfortable. Hiked through creeks and springs and feet were dry. We will see how long they last.", "I love them so far! But only been on two hikes with them so far. Very comfy, feel sturdy, good protection from rocks and roots. I also like the classic styling. Haven\u2019t used them in the rain yet, but looking froward to trying it out. My feet did get pretty hot though. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of ventilation.", "Really like these boots the fit was better than expected. I will buy again when I need a pair of hiking shoes.", "Fantastic product, but consider the socks that you will wear with these before you buy. I typically wear thicker socks when hiking, and needed to go a 1/2 size up to make these work.", "Comfortable right out of the box. First use was on a 5.5k hike with a 850ft ascension on rocky terrain, with approximately 40lb pack. No issues, great ankle support! I have a bad ankle and these kept me on the trail. They get a little warm, to be expected with waterproofed boots. Walked through some shallow creeks and wet marshy conditions feet stayed dry. I love the style. I ordered them1/2 size smaller (per previous reviews I read) than my standard shoe size and they fit well!", "I like everything about this boot with one exception. I thought it lacked arch support. There's plenty of room to slide in a good pair of orthotic arch supports which made them perfect for me.", "These are my second pair- purchased for when the first may wear out. Best boots for hiking ever. I've been through northern Wyoming and Colorado Rockies and Peruvian Andes with them. Purchased the wide size for my wide feet, and they fit plushly.", "Quality product, extremely comfortable out of the box, provides running shoe feeling in smooth surfaces and comfortable and reliable traction on rugged terrain wet or dry. This is a must have, me and my wife are very happy with our purchase.", "I was looking for a three season boot that I could easily get on and off in the airport, as well as wear in a business casual work environment. These fit the bill. Immediately comfortable, out of the box. They look sturdy and well made. I am sitting inside with cold and rain outside and they make me feel good.", "Did only a 4mi hike to break them in before a 30+ miles backpacking trip and had no issues whatsoever. They work great crossing creeks and the waterproofing works quite well in light snow. I've got several compliments on the looks too", "Received these boots in factory box from Danner. Upon opening them, noticed they were already laced up and had obviously been worn. The bottoms of the soles were dirty as though someone had already tested them out and left the evidence on the soles. They fit properly and felt good with very light feel. Time will tell on the durability.", "I am a real Timberland fan. But this time I go with Danner. This boot is one of the comfortable ones. Very light and durable. Recommended if you are walking, standing, and working all day.", "Fantastic find! No breaking in needed. Fits perfect. Quality craftsmanship.", "First off, these boots run a bit large so order accordingly (I did and am happy). These boots are amazing. They fit comfortably from the toe all the way up. They came with tan and red laces with the red laces on them. They look casual and are very rugged. The quality is impressive. I had them in my cart for a while and finally pulled the trigger and am glad I did.", "Danner\u2019s are phenomenal boots (owned MANY pairs)! However, be careful with the Java/bossa nova boot - they look dark brown/chocolate on Amazon but in real life they are a little more purple\u2019ish. They fit great and are comfortable as hell - no doubt they are great Danner boots but not happy with the color difference...sending back for something more my color.", "Love these boots. Hiked the Appalachian Trail in March. I had cheap boots in the past. I am 6 foot 250 lbs, with normal arches, with left foot supinating. These boots, you can feel that it's a rock, but you can't feel the rock, if that makes sense. It's super comfortable, like walking on regular pavement. I really hope they don't fall apart at the seams as I have read about. I love them too much.", "Great Boots! I went for the Wider width since my foot is right on the Cusp! It was a good move. Only thing I cannot figure out is, the right boot squeaks for the first 5-10 minutes of wear! Other than that...Love the boots!", "These boots are awesome, I had buyers are Morse Avenue 1st because they\u2019re so expensive. But they fit like a glove on your feet and I just love wearing them all the time, even around the house. Thank you so much. I\u2019m a brand supporter for life", "These wide are not that wide. I was not able to wear my hiking socks with these boots. They were even a little snug with my regular socks. Very sad, I wanted to like these shows. I owned another pair of Danner boots so long that I had to have them resoled three times. Cause of that, this is why I purchased these hiking boots. Oh well I hope they work out for others.", "Shoes fit great right out of the box. I\u2019m on my feet on a concrete floor all day and am very picky with boots. These have been great so far, I\u2019m hoping they last a while.", "I wear these everyday at work outside and love them, they feel like a leather high top sneaker but are sturdy like a boot. The leather is soft so probably not durable for heavy abuse but for moderate use or just walking around they are very comfortable", "Very comfy and light. They do run kinda warm, they seem durable, haven't tested waterproofing. Color definitely lighter then picture, I used mink oil to make it darker.", "These boots are for hiking, I am using them for ranching. They resist staining (important working with livestock), are comfortable, light weight and have good traction.", "Size down was perfect as it should be since it is actually my foot length. Shoe laces too long. Shoes are squeezing when walking. Replacement laces we're not the same type. 54\" laces work better.", "Surprisingly quiet on hard surfaces and comfy cushioned insoles. I chose the full-grain smooth leather over the brushed finish after noting the failures of the latter in reviews.", "its the second time I'm Buying them Very light Very comfortable", "Great boots. Order 1/2 size smaller than what you normally wear they run big. I usually wear an 11 but 11\u2019s were way to big but a 10 1/2 fit perfect.", "Very light weight. Especially for a Danner. Stiff on delivery as any boot should be expected, at first. Quickly conforming. Still new. Only wearing a few hours a day for now. Like a kitchen sponge. My boots get demoted as a new pair comes in. Too early to say more", "So far so good. Break in isn\u2019t bad. Been wearing them for about a week off and on. Arch is higher then most. I\u2019m a 10.5 in most boots/shoes and they fit well. Also ordered wide and they fit spot on. Traction is great. Over all I\u2019m happy. The true test is on the trail.", "So far so good - they fit great, they\u2019re a joy to walk in - we\u2019ll see if they hold up.", "I bought this item after it was recommended on hiking websites. I love how light it is. Super comfortable. This is my main hiking shoes for medium to long hikes.", "I bought these for my husband as a present and he absolutely loves them! He says it feels like he's not even wearing boots. He will even wear them into the office and snowy days. And can drive in them!", "I really like Danner boots/ shoes but these miss the mark for me. They still fit too large despite sizing down a half size like Danner suggests. After receiving them I found out they were not made in the USA which is disappointing to me. I still believe in Danner as a brand but I think I'll stick to the USA made only boots from now on.", "Boots are ok, not the typical quality you would expect from Danner. The other reviews about the boots being extremely HOT are spot on. These boots are definitely made for cold weather and your our feet will sweat.", "These boots are awesome! After all the shoes I have worn over the years I think I just may be a Danner man. They feel so good on my feet and one of the things I love is it take only a few seconds to put them on and take them off. If you're on the fence all I can say is buy them and you're welcome.", "They are decent. There are better boots out there but there are definitely worse boots out there too. I would say these boots are amazingly mediocre.", "Purchased these boots because my boyfriend and myself went hiking around different mountain ranges in South America . He absolutely loved them, from hiking in cold wet marsh land to high dry cold moutains they kept his feet dry and comfortable with long days.", "Shoes are nice and light, fit great and are well made. I climb trees for a living and they are surprisingly good climbing boots. Very satisfied, will buy another pair when the time comes", "Good fit out of the box Great looking boot almost too nice to ruin trail riding. Not a boot for really cold weather but will do in a pinch.", "Beautiful boots. Great quality. Fit exactly as described. I bought the wide for my husband and he loves them. No break in time needed.", "This boot is an excellent product. It is very comfortable right out of the box, fits true to size, and is constructed with attention to detail. The boot is nicely finished, and looks better in the hand than in the pictures. I haven't had it out on a trail yet, but the sole seems to provide excellent traction and is very stable. Given past experience with Danner boots I expect that it will be highly satisfactory.", "These are the most comfortable pair of boots/shoes I have ever owned. The description said to size down one size. I did from 13 to 12 and they fit great. I wear them far more often then I thought I would as they make my lower back feel great after a long day on the feet.", "Pretty comfortable right out of the box, like everyone else said they do run a little big about 1/2 size. Only had them 2 weeks but pleased.", "The most comfortable hiking boat I've ever worn. Right out of the box they feel like they are broken in already. Went on a short 3 mile hike the first weekend after purchase and feet weren't tired or blistered. Unreal for not breaking them in first. I highly recommend these boots for everyone interested in comfortable shoes.", "My fiance loves the boots! They do run a little small but we ordered a half size smaller due to previous reviews. The half size smaller fits just right!", "I just received my new Danners. I LOVE THESE BOOTS! So comfortable. They look great as well. Well done Danner! I haven\u2019t walked further than 20 yards yet but they seem perfect! I wear a 10.5 running shoe and these are also 10.5.", "I\u2019m an 11.5 and it fits well. So light and comfy. Can\u2019t wait to go hiking. I could wear them everyday. They look good, feel good and will last a long time.", "Well built boot. They are very light but I think they will take some hard trails. Nice to see extra laces in the box. You get what you pay for. I recommend Danner boots with out reservation.", "He loves these boots wanted \"Colorado\" hikers... well I got close enough, and that is saying a lot!", "I bought these because they looked like a pair of Dexter hiking boots I had years ago. They are very comfortable and surprisingly light. Excellent boots.", "**Important as Danner refused to exchange my boots due to this issue Boots feel right as you try them on, but after a couple miles on a trail there is a seam at the ball of your foot that starts to dig into your feet as you walk. It can become quite painful. I'd recommend wide boots if you're at all unsure.", "Excellent Shoe ,I will purchase another as soon as available!", "I have always wanted a pair of Danner boots, ever since I saw a park ranger wearing them. I had no idea how comfortable they would be. I love them.", "Having a wide foot, it's difficult to find a hiking boot that fits just right. These fit so comfortable out the box, sometimes I wear them as casual shoes. I did not need to break them in.They keep my feet dry in snow or rain. I would suggest getting the regular leather vs seude and using danner's boot cream treatment", "This is a good option for folks requiring a wide shoe. They are very light and the fit was perfect. I was worried that these might be an overpriced trail type tennis shoe but they seem to made fairly durable. I have not had them long but so far so good.", "Fit great rite out of the box , I have been a Marrell fan and still love the jungle mocs but i gotta tell ya these are the the most comfortable hikers i have ever owned and i will be checking out other Danner products ,well worth the money", "Much too small for a 13 2EE! Different pair of boots was larger but still a little tight. Both made in Viet Nam! Needless to say I still don't know about quality!", "I came so close to getting Salomon's or Merrells. I'm so glad I got the Danners. The fit is so comfortable, with good support. They feel athletic, not clunky at all. Cool looking, too, a retro look, not all rubber and layers and colors. I can wear this in the woods, at work and hanging out. So glad I got these Danners instead of other good brands. wouldn't have been as pleased. These are the ones for me.", "The most comfortable work shoe! My husband keeps buying these boots! They are so perfect for his job.", "This is the most comfortable hiking shoe I have ever owned. I have a pair of Winter boots in the same model and loved them. I now have both the winter and summer boots. Five stars", "I have osteoarthritis in my knees real bad, and these shoes, made a remarkable difference in comfort, very comfortable and stable, I would recommend them to anyone with bad feet or knees, or anyone else.", "Husband loved these! Hiked Canada the day after purchasing for two weeks straight and not a single blister.", "Good solid lightweight hiking boots. Purchased on sale. Worn for multiple hikes in the mountains in Virginia and North Carolina. Good traction. Also have worn these for landscaping, other treks, and travel. They fit a little large and seem a bit bulky. Overall good solid shoes.", "I typically wear 12.5 to 13 in NIKE Under armour and redwings 11.5w fits my feet perfect. Loved the first pair so much that I ordered 3 more pairs", "Ready to hike, right out of the box. No break-in necessary. All the quality I\u2019ve come to expect from Danner in a great looking casual boot that can be worn with just about anything.", "I found them to be too small. Granted, my right foot is a little bit bigger than the left, but they just felt tight in the toe box. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re great for other people, but they just didn\u2019t fit me. I was expecting them to fit like a running shoe like everyone said, but I found them to be rather stiff.", "Fit perfect out of the box. Hiked the mountains of north Georgia four different days averaging 4 hours a day in muddy wet terrain and the performed flawlessly. I am a big man but had no problems with hot spots or slippage. I wear an 11.5 wide in work boots and new balance shoes so I went with the same in the Danner boots and was extremely pleased.", "Great boots ... I ignored the reviews and ordered in my usual size, and had to return to take 1/2 size down. Listen to the reviews and save yourself the hastle, try a 1/2 size down first. GREAT BOOTS otherwise. Comfortable, and a great look.", "Bought rich brown and received sandy suede. Returned hoping to get the right boot, was sent these, nothing like the pictures. Was hoping for a dark boot as pictured and got these.", "I still have some Danners that were made in Germany. I still where these even though they are 20 plus years old.This is a good quality boot which when broken in, fits well. My only disappointment is the laces are flat and way too long. However, they are easily replaced. Good value.", "First time I ordered the inside liner had a crease in it from sloppy fabrication which made it very uncomfortable to wear. Got a replacement ordered which came quickly, but then that one had a cheap sticker on the sole of the left boot which was incredibly difficult and annoying to remove, leaving sticky residue, and also after the first time wearing them one shoelace is already coming apart.", "I have gone hiking 25 or so times with these boots and have been very satisfied with the comfort and the performance (gripping, water resistant) up to this point.", "The color and texture pictured is completely off. They\u2019re a dusty tan color straight out of the box. It\u2019s alarming, and tbh it\u2019s pretty ugly. The only way you\u2019ll get that color is buying a can of Danner boot dressing at the same time as your purchase of the boots. Otherwise, they\u2019re great. That just isn\u2019t the color. AT ALL.", "I ordered these for my son, and he loves them. He says they are the most comfortable hiking boots he has ever owned. He hiked in them right away and didn't have any blisters or discomfort. They seem very durable also.", "Little to dislike. Price was right and product well made. Very quiet while walking on paved surfaces.", "danner boots are good its a shame usa company moved manufacturing to vietnam i was so disappointing it just show what american workers value money in high wages that force outsourcing to cheaper labor force", "I usually wear a 10, and ended up having to go with a 9. These boots are AMAZING. Wore them out of the box for a trip to Idyllwild. Hiked for 3 days with zero blisters and zero discomfort/soreness.", "Sizing is right on no need for size down. I don\u2019t know why i waited so long to buy these !! They are amazingly comfortable. I can\u2019t attest to durability yet but i must say they are ready to wear right out of the box. So comfortable and light yet still warm. If you are on the fence about these just pull the trigger will not regret it. Love them", "Ordered the rich brown full grain, got a sand suede.... look at the pictures for the rich brown full grain - the first/featured photo you have is not the same boot you show in all the subsequent photos", "Love these boots. Instantly comfortable. I've been able to hike in them with zero break in time. Vibram rubber is the way to go for outdoor shoe soles. These boots are warmer than expected (in a good way) and the water resistant treatment is working great!", "Great boot for a year and a half. Over the past 6 months the vertical stitching around the arch of the boot has split on both boots. Upsetting ass I love the look, traction and fit of this boot. Will be trying merells or keens next.", "Really a fine hiking boot. Extremely comfortable and they fit my very narrow foot. Excellent workmanship.", "Pros: Warm Waterproof Strong sole Light Cons: With waterproofing such as goretex it's a little humid in the shoes after a while. Laces arent very sturdy in my opinion, likely due to a weight saving build philosophy.", "Incredibly comfortable from day one. Purchased these for my husband to take on a hunting trip trip to South Africa and they were perfect. He said they are the most comfortable shoes he\u2019s had in a long time.", "These boots are very well made and comfortable. I haven't used them on a long hike yet but have not had any problems on short distances.", "Very comfortable! Runs large for me. Sized down 1/2 and could have maybe gone a full size down.", "They're absolutely too hot your feet can't breathe can't wear them in warm weather", "Bought to replace an older set of Merrells. I've got about 60 miles on them now and I am happy with the fit and feel, but the toe caps are starting to pull away from the boot. Nothing major yet, but in 60 miles, this should not be happening.", "The build quality was great and I liked the look, but it was a little too narrow even in the wide version. I have a 3E wide foot and was hoping it would fit, but it was exactly a 2E just like they listed. I guess my optimism didn't pay off on this one.", "These took no breaking in at all and worked great. Very waterproof out of the box in moderate use, but ended up wet trudging through snow (partially because they are not tall enough to keep snow out). Well made, highly recommended.", "Excellent pair of boots extremely comfortable! Love these boots! Will get another pair after these wear out.", "One of the best boots I've ever had. Very comfy and warm. They're great for winter but if its warm at all your feet will get very sweaty because these don't breathe. I believe they make this boot in a breathable option though.", "Great quality boot. The best, most comfortable boots I have ever owned. This is my second pair. I have foot problems and these make working in the yard and around the house painless for my feet.", "I ended up returning these boots. I really wanted to like them, but I didn't feel like they were quite rugged or durable enough for what I'd be using them for (backpacking, work around the house, etc.). They seem to be geared more towards fashion-minded folks, which is fine, but not what I need.", "These boots fit okay with heavyweight socks but are far from waterproof as Danner has suggested. I had to wring my socks out 3 times on my hike this past weekend. I enjoyed the fit so much I bought the low boots but I need something with better water performance than these.", "I really like this boots. It doesn't look like tactical or rugged boots. But so far the quality is great and priced right. It's waterproof, comfortable to use and light weight not heavy.", "These boots are incredibly comfortable and surprisingly lightweight. I bought them for a winter trip to New Mexico as I knew there would be plenty of snow and I was absolutely impressed at how dry and warm my feet remained even after a long day of walking in the snow. The tread is perfect for hiking in a variety of conditions and I love the style.", "I like the boots and they are great quality, and good price, but it's pretty lame that are flat as a board inside and they want you to spend $50 on custom inserts to change that. have never needed to do that before. At that point, I would have rather just spent more on different boots that were made for a real human foot.", "The boot has a broken in feel straight out of the box. It gives you the support of a boot but the feel of a tennis shoe. I\u2019ve worn them for hours at a time without and discomfort. I do wish there was a little more padding at the back of the foot, but you don\u2019t notice the lack of padding with thicker socks. This is an everyday type boot.", "I'm owner of Danner MOUNTAIN 600 4.5\" DARK BROWN/GREEN. These are great boots. Lightwait like sneakers. Good tracking control with Vibram outsole even on wet surfaces. But suede upper and Danner Dry don't provide waterproof protection. Heavy rain - no problem, deep puddle or long wet snow hiking - and the boots are already leaking. Have been wearing them for less than a month now.", "I love these boots!!! They immediately felt like I had been wearing them for years. No break in period. They look cool too. I wear them everywhere. I could not be happier with this purchase.", "These are great boots. Very light weight and easy to break in.", "Nicely made and comfortable. Good for light hiking and walking. Casual book but offers good support. For serious hiking look at Danner's other hiking boots", "These have the fit feel and support of sneakers. Good for normal every day use. Not a great choice for hiking.", "These boots are awesome. There are no other boots like it. They are my boots. I hope to never be apart from these boots.....No but seriously these boots scream quality. I foresee me owning these boots till they give out and when they do I will buy the same exact pair again.", "These boots are very comfortable. They look great, and fit great.", "Very comfortable and provides good support which is what hubby was looking for", "I am still trying to figure out if I should return for next size. All of the reviews I read including Danner's recommended sizing. They all recommended to go a half size smaller. I went with a 9 instead of my standard 9.5. Although the shoe fits they seem to be somewhat smaller than what they should be. I do love the look and the feel of the boot very comfy.", "I have been wearing for regular use not hiking. So far it been great. Looks good and feels good too. I have spent 5-6 hrs continuously being on my feet with these shoes and my feet did not hurt. Nice shoes I would recommend.", "Very comfortable boots right out of the box good quality", "These run big! I bought a 13e and a 14 to start and ended with a regular 13. I bet I could swing down to a 12.5e, but we\u2019ll see how these break in. If you\u2019re a 14 in Nike\u2019s and they\u2019re a little snug width wise, get a regular 13 in these.", "these were a little more expensive than i would normally like to pay but they are really worth it. the best description i can give is they are like hiking boots that feel like sneekers. no break-in time, excellent boots.", "My boots arrived and had ordered a half size smaller what I had read. Discovered the boot was to small went to \"Danner Boots\" wed site and discovered the right size should be 10.5.", "What a nice light boot.Just no arch support so I can't wear them.", "I am still breaking in the sole but the upper fit well and was comfortable right away.", "Overall awesome boot. Definitely go the half size lower as these run big. I am a 10.5 and the 10 fits perfect with a little room for thicker socks.", "I have used these boots under one year. They fit well and seemed to be good boots but the seams are coming apart on the upper part of the boot. I expected to get at least one full season of use out of a $150+ boot. I had the same problem with every Danner boot I used in the marines as well.", "Boots are great, my go to hiking boots. However, there were a couple surprises when I got these in the mail. They weren't in a box, just jammed into a bag, and they didn't have insoles. A little strange. So the money I saved buying them on Amazon went straight to picking up last minute insoles at REI.", "Hard to change into anything else once you put these on.", "Wearing them for 9 months now and no complaints. Fit and look is great. Plan to buy again.", "Great boots for police work. They run a little warm but nothing nothing a good pair of socks can't handle. The grip well running on asphalt, climbing through brush, and they are perfectly waterproof.", "Always have a couple pairs on hand, very versatile boot wether it be casual, construction, law enforcement or even its intended purpose, hiking. I get about 2+ years out of this boot and they go through all of the above. I have chronic plantar fasciitis and this is the best relief I\u2019ve found. Buy them, you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "Much easier to get on. Laces stay tied and comfortable. Good value.", "Good fit, minimal padding, more like a high top tennis shoe the a hiking, happy overall", "I wear these boots everyday with the birkenstock insole. Very comfortable. Highly recommended.", "Love these boots.. stuck with my usual size and everything was good. Great support, and look great as casual wear as well.", "I take an 11 wide, and the boots that I ordered were that size. They were too narrow, and did not fit. I returned them.", "Fell apart after 3 months. Another junk product from Danner", "true to size and fits like a sneaker! This would be one of the few boots I would feel ok on a 10 miler with out break in period. Definately get the waterproof spray to back it up. Looks great too, not too clunky. Great spaces to do custom lace tequniques", "Quality expected from Danner. Needed wide boots, these fit the bill as Danner always does. Great for everyday use or for good hike trails.", "I did what the product guide says to order 1/2 smaller. They fit ok, but they were a little tight- like a 1/4 size. Used stretching and leather conditions. I used some tight shoe horns. The next morning fit perfect. I typically a size 8.5 I ordered an 8. Like the style and very\u200b good boot.", "Danner quality!!! Comfort is number one. Wish the soles would last longer tho. These would be a long lasting boot except sole wear", "Love these boots. fits and look awesome. First day wore for 12 hour day at work with no break in. Feels like a tennis shoe, supports like a boot. I've been watching these a while and finally bought. No regerts. Haha (regrets) another great product. Thanks Danner", "Very comfortable, nice soles. Also good looking: I bought two pair, will hike with one, use the other for daily/work. Nice touch: the extra laces provided are brown, which tones down the look quite a bit.", "If I were you I would order a Half a Size bigger since they are quite snug, I just have to wear them with thinner socks but they are definitely comfy I love them!", "Great pair of boots, not just for hiking but for everyday. Comfortable right out of the box. Danner makes great products and Amazon gets them to you quickly at a good price. Thanks", "This a great hiking shoe. I have been using them for daily hikes for about 30 days. I experienced no discomfort at all. No break-in period necessary. They are truly waterproof. It\u2019s great to find a product that actually lives up to manufacture claims", "I bought these and they are the first pair of Danner\u2019s I have owned. I was pretty loyal to Asolo Fugitive GTX\u2019s and I bought these because of both recommendations and reviews (also I didn\u2019t want to spend $260). From day one they have not only fit perfectly but they have held up in appearance. Will buy again!", "Already been on two long hikes in the high country in Colorado. The boot is very good fitting boot. They Ted to run large so I ordered a half size smaller than I usually wear and the fit couldn\u2019t be better. I cannot day enough about the sole of these boots. Not one slip in 20 or so miles of rough terrain. Great product. Definitely recommend these boots.", "These boots were not the color advertised. I was expecting a smooth full grain leather which these are more like suede. Other than that they are comfortable so far.I will say I'm disappointed in the advertisement and the description of these boots.", "These are the most comfortable boots I have had since my danner elk Hunter boots. I tried the steadfast and the are not near as comfortable as the 600's", "Fit well. Waterproofing seems to be cheap. Great boot overall.", "Really like this boot. Just be aware the color will change significantly after treatment. Mine darkened up at least a few shades but I like the darker color. Ton of support for your ankles on uneven ground.", "I love this boot. Their was no breakingin time at all. I rode 200 miles of the Blue Ridge parkway in the rain and my feet was the only part of me that remained dry. These boots are very comfortable I wore them for 10 hours each day for the first two day I owned them.", "Require the right socks, but after that, perfect! Super comfortable.

I usually wear a size 11.5 but went with an 11. Almost no break in period needed. Very very comfortable.", "Very comfortable. I used these all summer long hiking in the Pacific Northwest and I did a lot of hiking. They have held up pretty well. I did have to reglue the soul where it meets the toe on one but other than that they have worked great.", "I've been looking at this boot for awhile and finally got a pair. I work as a park ranger and put these boots threw everything.. like I'm basically hiking all day and these boots are so comfortable, sturdy, and look great..

But when i opened the box i noticed that one of the shoe laces was frayed in multiple place's. my only concern it that I will have to replace the laces soon. Would have given 5 stars if not for the laces.", "Have had these 3 Months and there perfect' danner is well known for boots' walk all day in style and confurt'", "Danners are quality boots - great for urban hiking. I did have to switch out for some athletic inserts - the pair included was a thin memory foam that seemed very flat combined with the heel. Boots are just a bit on the larger side.", "These are not hiking boots. They're high top sneakers that look like hiking boots. They do not have the stiffness or support for hiking on rough trails or off trail. The leather is just a thin veneer over the fairly weak shoe material. Fine for around town, but not the mountains.", "Order a half size down these boots run a bit big. They are super comfy and I can where them all day without discomfort. I liked them so much I ordered them in their low top form.", "Awesome light boot, usually wear a 12 in nike so I bought a 11.5 and fits perfect. Also have a wide foot but the D fit just fine.", "I work in the landscaping business and wear these boots about every day and they had held up great considering what I put them through. Only issues I have had are the laces broke and the seems on the inside of the boots have come undone. However how lightweight, comfortable and waterproof they are they are my go to boots. I have also done a 3 day backing trip in these and had no complaints. I love these boots so much I have bought another pair, could ask for a better boot.

One if the finest pair of boots I\u2019ve purchased and worth every penny.", "Love the boots they fit like a glove and are super light weight what I don't like is the damn sticker on the insole that I cannot get off lol it's making my sock stick to it so it's really annoying guess ill have to get some different insoles other then that they rock", "Fantastic Shoe! I am wide footed and these shoes came with extra room, great support, and comfortable to walk in. Wore them all day at work to try to break them in and they were no discomfort at all. I would definitely recommend to a friend and coworkers. I can\u2019t to try these on the trail this weekend", "These boots fit great out of the box. True to size.

These boots in size 13 fit very well and are super comfortable on long hikes.", "I love these boots that I actually got a second pair of them. They run a little big (size down .5). The insoles are pretty worthless, so I put smartfeet blues in there. Otherwise I have over 200 miles in them and they are fantastic.", "I bought these before doing some hikes in Zion, Utah and was was worried about not being able to break them in before.

These are a great walking shoe in uneven and rocky terrain.... if you want all day comfort fast these are the shoes for you!", "Perhaps I should have purchased one half size smaller. They have a bit of give on descents. Other than that, these are phenomenal boots. In the past my feet were the problem on long (10+ mile) day hikes. That problem is completely eliminated with these boots.", "The only boots I've never needed to break in! I had never purchased Danner's before, but I'll probably never buy any other brand again.", "Husband says these are the best shoes he\u2019s invested in.

I use these to fish brook trout streams in VA mountains. Good grip on wet rocks. Being waterproof, I can walk in the water to cast. They\u2019re warm too. The only downside is their lack of breathability.", "Very comfortable. Had a one day break in at the office and then hiked Harney Peak and Little Devils Tower with great comfort. Great boots.", "These are my favorite boots. Very light weight and offer lots of under foot cushion. I bought my first pair 2 years ago and wore them virtually every day since.", "Only reason for the 1 star is that they were comfortable, other than that they were made poorly and did not breathe at all!

Recommended to 3 other friends and theirs came as expected as well.", "Because of a high arch, I typically require 2E and 4E shoes and boots. Even so, many are too narrow.

I look forward to wearing them on camping and hiking trips in 2020!", "Good looking boot but I had to send them back to large.", "Runs small like a size to size and a half!

They didn\u2019t seem to care. Third pair that I have bought.... only a four month boot!", "These are not comfortable boots. The insole is rock hard and offer very little support.

I wanted a pair for nostalgia since they remind me of boots that were popular in the early 80's. They are super comfortable and look great.

I'm very happy with my purchase.", "This boot is the great. Fit and look was as expected.

I wear a women's 9 1/2 and theses are a men's 7 1/2 and they fit like a glove. I think they run a little narrow, that's why I bought the men's.

Great boots though!", "I initially gave these 2 stars because of how terrible they felt. But I decided to suffer through several outings with them to give them some time to break in. They did break in a little but still aren't very comfortable. Even with my expensive custom, 3D scanned orthotics in them, they leave me wanting more comfort. I think the issue is the lack of padding inside and around the ankles. Thick socks help some but that's not always the most pleasant during summertime. I'll keep these for wear when I'm going out in a pair of jeans and plaid/flannel shirt, but I'll use other footwear for real comfort when hiking.", "Excellent hiking boots.

I expected the high quality made in the USA product I have come to know and expect... Imagine my alarm upon finding these boots made in China and of Way inferior craftsmanship than the Danner of lore. I guess that with the success of the book and film \u201cWild\u201d the iconic Danner red lace and brown suede boot became newly sought after by young urban hikers but... did you have to make such a lightweight version of the old stumptown classic.

Super comfortable.", "I have Mountain lights as well and these are great for regular hikes without heavy packs. These are now my go to boot.", "If the bottom two D-rings weren't there, these might be the most beautiful hiking boot ever made! I'm kind of getting used to them, but they do look like a cross between a bowling shoe and a hiking boot. If you look closely at the downward view picture, you will see what I'm saying. I think they resemble bowling shoes because the laces go damn near to the toe which makes your foot look short and stubby. Other than that they are what was pictured, I just wish I'd looked closer at the pictures. They are somewhat large (about 1/4 size), but that's how I like it because I usually wear wool socks.", "These are great boots. The fit true to size. I have done the High Camps in Yosemite with them, about a 30-40 pound pack for 50+ miles. They seem adequately waterproofed, but I put some product on them anyways to be safe. I am planning to take them on a backpacking trip to the White Mountains in September, should be a good test for them, i am not worried at all.

Super comfortable and surprisingly light", "Glad I read about them a bit first and ordered a half size down. They fit and felt great out of the box. Felt little break in after a few miles.", "Comfortable right out of the box. I usually wear a 12.5 or 13. I ordered the 12\u2019s and they fit fine even with thicker socks.", "Super comfortable right out of the box. I liked them so much I bought a second pair in a different color!", "Wow! Normally shoes and boots I buy require a break in period where my feet ache. These were surprisingly comfortable and have continued to provide comfort for my 12 hrs standing on cement. I have found they are warmer than my snow boots. My only problem is that I got the suede boots (aesthetics only). I am wearing them to work most often and they get dirty very quickly(as opposed to the dirt of the trails). They clean fairly well minus the oil stains still experimenting with cleaning. I probably should have gotten the leather version. However I believe this is now my boot of choice and can see myself buying many generations.", "I purchased these based on wide width offering and the number of positive reviews, but unfortunately, did not have the same experience. While they appear to be a relatively well-made shoe, and they seemed to fit well, they absolutely killed my feet (ankles, and top of foot at shoe crease). Had high hopes, but had to return them.", "Took a couple days to break in but that was expected based upon other reviews. Great all around boot.", "Best pair of hiking boots I've ever owned.

Really great purchase.", "Awesome looking but did not fit very well a little too wide", "Wish that they were built in the USA but other that that a great boot.", "Well, I have been wearing these boots far about a month now. The quality is good, but not as good as Danner's use to be. They use to be high quality, made in the USA. They are now made in China, of lesser quality. They feel more like a high top tennis shoe than a boot, which I do like personally. But some will not, because there is not as much ankle support. One thing I really like is the Vibram soles. They grip quite nicely to my icy driveway and other slippery surfaces, as compared to my older danner GPX soles. One thing to note, I always wear an 11, but with these a 10.5 fits nicely.", "Awesome boots. Best I've ever owned. Great price, quick delivery.", "While breaking them in these have squeaked louder than any other pair of shoes or boots that I've ever owned. These squeak like a freakin' chipmunk whenever you mess with the tongue. I'm really wishing I had returned these while I had the opportunity. Fairly comfortable.

Will definitely buy this again!", "Ordered one size smaller ( 9.5 instead of 10.5) and fits well.", "Very happy with these boots. I took them to the desert in Southwest Texas after receiving them for a test run. They are extremely comfortable and the soles grip exceptionally well. Very confident they will hold up well for day hikes. I did order a half size smaller than I would normally buy and they fit great. I would not however order a full size smaller as some reviewers have recommended.", "Great boots. No break-in time needed. Style and function are better than I anticipated.", "Boots are well made but fit a bit large. I ordered Danner's anti-fatigue insole and fit is now correct. For my needs the sole is to thin even with the additional insoles. I will order something heavier from Danner next time around. I rated these a 3 only because of the loose fit. The sole selection was my error. The site makes clear that this is a very light weight boot. I gave them to my son and he likes them a lot. Hard to go wrong with Danner.", "Put 20 miles on them first weekend. Great boot !", "These are the most comfortable boots I've ever had, look great too!", "Amazing boot.... reminds me of the old SUNDOWNERS. Very light!!!!!", "I wear an 11, but these I found a 10.5 is best. Fit great and are lightweight", "Very comfortable boot. Since it is leather there is some \"squeek\" that you have to deal with. Another reviewer commented on the shoe laces - he is right, they are not good and tend to slip if not tied correctly. I double cross them just before the quick lace grommets and do the same at the top, then double knot them. This prevents my foot from slipping in the boot and keeps the boot fitted well.", "Awesome boots. I will be buying Danner from now on.", "I bought these shoes for my husband... He\u2019s in love with them.", "These boots are the epitome of the Danner brand. My work requires me to wear boots on a daily basis. Having to be versatile, some days working on concrete, in the office, and others hiking in the woods. These boots hold up to the task extremely well.

I own multiple pair of Danner and other brand boots but these are hands down my favorite.", "Great shoes. I'm wearing size 7,5 US but mountain 600: size 7 US. The boots are great, very comfortable and classic style.", "Great shoe. But I had to exchange and size down a half size.", "Have not worn Danner boots since 1999, out of site, out of mind, i.e. no longer was in a profession (flying helicopters in Alaska where they were needed). However, with this recent and short-notice purchase online for a trip to Germany in winter, I received them the very next day. They fit like a glove. There was the slightest bit of a rubbing effect just above the inside ankles; left and right, but the right more so than the left. I am now wearing them for the second day and they already feel like a well-worn pair of custom-made soft boots. And did I mention that they are light?!?!?! LOVE them!", "Great comfortable boots for hiking on paved or trail surfaces.", "As one who works constantly on my feet 10-12 hrs. a day AND suffers with arthritis in both feet, I can say, without hesitation, that my Danner Portlands are the BEST SHOES of any kind, I can endorse with two thumbs up!! I use to work in casual dress shoes for years, usually those with rubber soles. But the pain in my feet became so intense, I needed to find an alternative. I've had Danner Hiking shoes over the last 25 years and turned to them for a solution. My Portlands have measured up right out of the box. Bravo, again Danner, bravo!!", "Probably worse pair of boots I\u2019ve ever had. Simply a waste of $. Expected a lot more from this brand name, but everyone is out to trick anyone fool enough to fall for gimmicks and hype.", "Danner boots are labeled us 9/ eu 43. All of my size 9's are Eu 42 and fit perfectly. It'd be nice if Amazon listed the Europe size as well. These are good boots for <$130.00. I could feel the lace lugs so they could use a bit more internal padding. They are very light in weight.", "I Take a 10D shoe but ordered a 9 1/2 D per the recommendations of many. Too large. Sent it back and got a 9D. This was a perfect fit. Shoe very comfortable on paved and trail surfaces. Much cooler on Southern surfaces than I expected", "Nice light boots but way too big. Go size smaller", "This is my second pair of Danner boots this year. I bought a pair at a going out of business sale last summer. Danner provided insoles free because one was missing. Great company and great product. I wore Danners forty years ago in college and for a couple decades in the Air Force. I love the fit and they last forever.", "Christmas present for the boyfriend, he lives in Seattle. He's been treating them a little precious for the last couple months because he loved them so much, but finally got them muddy as hell last weekend on a 7 mile hike. They washed right off and dried good as new. Perfect pair of boots that is functional that can still dress up with khakis or jeans", "Overall these fit very well. Initial impression is a comfortable fit with good grip in wet weather. I'll update more once I've had a chance to really wear them in, but my first impression is that these are great boots.", "I was excited to check out these boots when looking at the photos and advertisements. The boots came and the build quality reminded me of a budget sneaker. The leather and color was also much different than the photos and looked and felt cheap.", "I have 2 pair of Danner hunting boots. I was expecting the same quality. I was correct , well made, light weight, comfortable. I was a little disappointed in the foot bed, it could have been better.", "Great boot for comfort, but designed for what I use them for, everyday shoe or day hiker. After reading the reviews, I nervously ordered a half size smaller. They were correct. So far extremely satisfied.", "Wore these to hike some hikes in Norway and Iceland and they kept my feet extra dry. Some of the other guys had GoreTex boots and had water end up in them but these Danner kept my feet dry throughout. Got 1/2 size down and these fit perfectly.", "Size Fit- this boot fits as expected. I consistently wear a size 10 wide in almost everything, military boots, running shoes, hiking boots etc. I bought a size 10 wide and it fit perfectly. Comfort- Excellent comfy fit. FYI, I am pretty flat footed. Still breaking them in, but it's more like breaking in a stiff pair of tennis shoes, not full grain leather boots. Durability - not yet sure, I have only had them for 2 weeks. Seems well made, time will tell.", "The boots were to large across the toe for me, I\u2019m in the process of trying to send them back for a different brand, but the boot is a good looking boot, and I can see why they\u2019ve gotten good revues, just not for me.", "I needed a hiking boot to replace my heavily warn Scarpas but didn't want to drop $200+ for them. These are not high end boots but cost affective. They could use a little more padding around the top but fit well and appear to be made in well even though they are not made in America like most of the Danner boots. They come with Red laces on them but have a set of Brown included.", "These seem like really nice shoes, but there is something about the last that does not work for my left foot. It's an odd problem I have never had with another shoe, but I am going to have to return these. The construction and look of the boot is truly good, and I'm sure my experience isn't the norm for customers of this product", "I had to buy the Danner DXT comfort footbed insole so I could wear this boot it was to soft. Comfort for a bad knee.", "Danner is always a great choice. I have 2 pairs of these and love the light weight and flexibility. Plus there waterproof which is a nice bonus.", "Okay, if you can find a better hiking boot you should immediately buy them. I have a foot problem and was worried about doing a 15/20 mile hike. Received the boots, 3 days later went on the hike and my feet felt great. It's like the boots are broken in before you wear them. I don't normally spend time doing reviews but, these babies derserved them.", "Bought these as a gift for my brother and he absolutely loves them. Have cemented my status as favorite sibling for life. Very comfortable, and look even better in person.", "I wear high quality hiking boots at work where I am very tough on boots.

While these are too light weight for my work they are perfect as a casual around town shoe....like an all leather basketball shoe, I love them.", "These boots are undersized, so I had to send them back for another pair. They are so comfortable though. I'm using them for work and hiking and I absolutely love them!", "I've only had them about a week but I wear them daily and they are comfortable, light and provide a reasonable amount of ankle support. I have not logged any miles hiking in them, mostly just wearing them to work and in casual settings. It's a good looking boot but the color in the image is not the same as the boot. My boots almost have a greyish-brown look to them. That is not a problem for me, because it looks good and the boot feels better.", "I have never had Danner shoes or boots before and tried these based on reviews. Unbelievable comfort. They still make some awesome products right here in the good ole USA.

My only problem is that they look like sneakers when you're wearing pants", "I went a 1/2 size down as suggested and they fit well. Comfortable right out of the box. Not near as stiff as I expected.

I needed a 10 with thicker than normal socks", "Comfortable, good looking boot. Looking forward to putting them to the test.", "Great boots so far. I've worn them on two all day hunting excursions and my feet felt great at the end of the day. Both days were warm and dry, so I'm not sure how they be on a wet, cold day. I bought them for warm dry weather, so I doubt I'll ever wear them in cold wet weather.", "The official website mentioned that these shoes tend to run a little large, so I sized it down to a 9 (I'm usually 9.5) and they fit perfectly. Other than that, they seem like great quality boots, but time will tell how well they hold up.", "True to size. I ordered my regular size and they fit perfect. Super comfortable and durable for hunting.", "High quality - I reccomend these boots for CA hiking.", "They weigh next to nothing, but are super comfortable and supportive on my wide feet. Very happy so far. Time can tell for durability.", "These have been the best boots out of the box I have ever owned. No break in time and they feel amazing. I have yet to test the waterproof but they are built very well. Excited to see what they can do.", "Nice looking boot but stated D width fits more like a EE. Probably could've went with a whole size down and still fit my size 10 foot.", "Lightweight, comfortable, and supportive. They weigh less than half of my Danner Quarry workboots.", "Awesome boots. Great that they come in wide and are waterproof. Great traction, no more rolled ankles.", "Great fit, great quality! My fiance\u0301 used these for a hike and loved how comfortable they were compared to his old boots.", "Awesome looking boot. Light weight,but made with durable materials. Fit was spot on and they are comfortable.", "Very happy with these boots. Very light and comfortable. Easy to put on and take off. An overall great boot.", "Great fitting boots, but not good at keeping out moisture. I've been wearing mine here in Oregon for a couple of weeks and sock where wet today. They fit so good I'm gonna hate returning them, but I have to.", "Great boot very lite but size runs about a half size small so order a half size larger", "Best boot/ shoe I have ever bought in 35 years. Tried Solomon and they were decent, but Danner is just in a complete other level. I purchased 3 pairs after trying them on. They fit true to Nike / Asics running shoe sizes and their EE width is perfectly balanced for people who wear wide square toe Luccasse boots. Never felt a softer cushion/ foot bed to walk on. Happy Happy, you will not be disappointed. They should charge double the price for these boots.", "nice boot but seems to run small especially after wearing them for a while", "They do run pretty large, I should have ordered 10.5", "Fits true to size and a comfortable. Happy with purchase.", "Comfortable and fit true to size, but the style is a little weird. The boots look like they are platform shoes in person. In other words, it looks like you are wearing these to make yourself taller. It's a strange style, and these boots definitely look better online than in person. \\", "I purchased back on March for 137.94 now Amazon wants 181.67 no way ...,", "had to return, fit was way too large. I usually wear a size 10 or 10.5. I sized down to 9.5 on their Jag model.", "Definitely NOT a hiking shoe. In my opinion this is a marketing ploy. This is a running shoe with a hiking boot lacing system. Remains to be seen if this shoe will operate effectively. I typically love Danner and have a pair of Proghorns that are almost perfect. I am contemplating returning these but haven't decided yet.", "my 9.5 are WAY high than 9.5. They do not fit and give little to no ankle support causing my ankles to dangerously roll. Despite them being defective in size, Danner refuses to stand behind their defective product and give me a refund. I'm done with Danner!! Never again!!!", "Honestly great boot. But it was a little bit too big for my foot so I sent it back (received over 10 days ago) and I never got my refund! Can someone look into this??", "Extremely disappointed! My first pair for Danners and my last! Both boots had different fitment issues that made them very uncomfortable. Plus i had to pay to ship them back.", "Love these boots. I spend 10-12 hrs a day on my feet in various weather & terrain (environmental construction work). They are warm enough for cooler weather, but don't make my feet sweat too bad in warmer weather (my feet sweat no matter what during the summer). These boots are comfortable from day one. They have quickly become my favorite footwear.", "Ordered 11.5 because those are what fit in the store for DAnner brand. These were huge on. Ordering a 10.5 and an 11 to see which fits. EXCELLENT shoe. Good looking and amazing comfort but be careful about sizing Update, the 11 fit perfectly.", "I went a half size smaller as read in the other reviews. I usually wear a 12 but got a 11.5 wide. Bingo.. it worked. These were perfect. Went on a few day hikes and they provide great support. Very light. I will be taking these on the next trip for sure.", "My husband will not shut up about these boots! He says they are the most comfortable things he's ever worn. And they were amazing for our hiking trips. Kept his feet comfortable and dry. He says he could live in them.", "I have had Danner boots in the past and they are still the best in the business. I would recommend Danner every day of the week and twice on Sunday", "They are comfortable, and seem to be durable so far."], "label": "test", "generated_meta_review": "Great boot! Very comfortable right out of the box. Im on my feet all day. No break in. I love these boots! These are not hiking boots. True to size and fits like a sneaker! I wear them everywhere.\n"}]
