            "This hotel was suggested to us by someone who had recently been there. Having never been to Rome we were happy for a suggestion. The hotel is located 1 block from the Piazza Navona, the most beautiful Piazza in all of Rome. We were there for 4 days and walked everywhere including Vatican City from our hotel. The room we got was small but comfortable and service was great. The breakfast was so-so but was available. Our son went there on their honeymoon this past summer and were very pleased as well. I would go back there any time.",
            "Just returned from a stay at theHotel Navona...or should I say an apartment they owned on the Vittiore Emanuelle....a 10 minute walk away. The apartment was booked back in January by an Italian speaking friend, and a price was agreed .Hoever when we arrived there was some dispute over the agreed price and the elderly owner didnt care if we stayed or not. He demanded 20 euros a night more and cash up front.Unable to resolve the issues,wWe proceeded to the apartment...very spacious but very basic.The sheets were darned and had holes in them!! The kitchen had an odd array of chipped crockery and two saucepans that I refused to use as they were so disgusting.The management did agree to change the sheets but as for the kitchen we were told was to be used\" only in emergencies\" and we could go to the hotel for brakfast .....We went to breakfast twice and decided to buy elsewhere as it really wasnt worth the 10 minute walk each morning. At the end of our stay we paid the original agreed fee as we dealt with Cory who remembered the original conversation back in Jan and was very kind and helpful...it was such a pity that the older man and the sour faced woman werent as obliging. Dont think I would make a return to the Navona Interesting to see no one else who has left comments seems to have stayed in the apartment!! !",
            "This is not the fanciest hotel, but it was quite sufficient for our needs. A nice continental breakfast was included in the price and our room was clean and quiet. The main reason why you would stay here is the location. It's about a two minute walk away from both Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. The Vatican is about 20 minutes away, and the Spanish Steps and Fontana di Trevi are even closer. If you stay here, you can walk anywhere to see the main sights of Rome (unless you also want to see the catacombs, which I recommend...) There are plenty of good and inexpensive restaurants (around Piazza Navona you'll find the good and expensive ones) close to the hotel. If you are staying in Rome for a shorter period of time, you don't want to waste time on unnecessary transportation. Hence, Hotel Navona is a perfect choice for a long weekend in Rome.",
            "In May, we emailed Hotel Navona for a room for 5 nights iearly October and got back an immediate response that the hotel was full but that they could provide a small apartment near the hotel for $175 E per night. We telephoned to make sure we understood the arrangement and booked the stay. When we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that we would be staying in \"the family palace\" and had no idea what we had let ourselves in for, The owner drove us to the \"palace\" and explained that it had been owned by the family since the 17th century and that they had only recently converted a few rooms to small apartments. We were very pleasantly surprised to find ourselves in a delightfully charming apartment on Corso Vittorio Emanuele with a large bedroom, a sitting room, a kitchen, and a small bathroom. We were on the fourth floor but had a lift and Navona staff brought our luggage in and put it in a taxi for us when we left. There were double windows that blocked out noise from the street but allowed a great view--down Corso on one side and into a central courtyard on the other. We were about 3 blocks from Piazza Navona and less than 2 from Campo di Fiori, right on major bus lines, next door to an excellent coffee/cafe shop that opened at 6:00 and had great, inexpensive coffee and breads and pastries in the morning and soups and sandwiches at lunch. The family that owns Hotel Navona could not have been more pleasant and accommodating, as was the staff. I would definitely plan to stay here again.",
            "The hotel is located in a great area, as we walked to Vacatican and up to Spanish Steps, Roman Ruins. All is there with many small streets with loads of places to eat and at all price ranges. The rooms were clean and bathrooms were exceptionally clean. Only negatives were the breakfast which is coffee and a roll but enough to get you going and staff can be distant. We were locked out one night as there is no central key given for the main area (hotel is located on third floor of large building) and ended up staying with our friend who lives in Rome that night, and we were not aware that we would not be able to get back into the hotel. If you want a good place to rest your head and not have to worry about taxis, buses, or underground, this is the place. We only took a taxi to and from the train station when we arrived and left. I would stay there again. Of course if you need American standards of large rooms and a full breakfast then this is not the place for you.",
            "This hotel is just off Piazza Navona. It is difficult to find in taxi so make sure you have a map. It is clean and basic accommodation. This is not luxury by any means. It is a good base for sight seeing and walking distance to all tourist attractions. Our room was cleaned daily and the room was also quiet. The breakfast is nothing to write home about! It is coffee and a packaged croissant. Better to eat out. Cheap and cheerful and a base for sightseeing - stay here. Looking for luxury - look elsewhere.",
            "The hotel is well situated but besides that it was expensive :Euros180 per night even though the guidebooks price it as moderate. I asked specifically for a quiet room and received precisely the opposite: traffic and pedestrian noise all night long. The bathroom stank to high heaven and the beds were not comfortable. The breakfast was worse than a McDonalds fast food experience. Cheap, packaged croissant, cheap cereals - nothing to write home about here. Overall I would say this is probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed in on holidayand I am not extremely fussy! The staff were friendly and accommodating although they did not accept a credit card and wanted cash or trveller's cheques in Euros only. A waste of money and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",
            "I recently stayed 4 days here with 17 boys and 13 parents. The hotel staff put up with a lot. They were pleasant, always there to help, and got up a 1/2 hour early every day to serve us breakfast. Our last night we left @ 3am.. Our bags were carried to the curb (all of them). Mike had a gift for everyone. While this is not a luxury hotel, it was pleasant , close to everything, clean and the showers worked fine. The Piazza Eustachio is right around the corner (best Cappuccino in Rome). All the locals go here. You are close to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona. Incidentally, The Piazza Navona is named after this hotel (or family). Mike will set you straight on this. Enjoy your stay in Rome. I did..",
            "Our family stayed in two rooms that were clean and well-lighted. We both had a \"courtyard\" view but were happy since a clothesline was easily available. The staff was friendly and we enjoyed our continental breakfast very much. When we needed directions, or help, the staff assisted with a smile. A bonus was the fresh flowers at the front desk. To walk to Piazza Navona (and the lovely Bernini fountains) took us a mere two minutes. For a large city like Rome, to be in such a good location with a clean and serviceable room, Hotel Navona is the ticket. Bonus: the bottom floor has an ancient fountain and the whole place is built atop an ancient site. Get Cory to explain the hotel history. Many English speaking staff are available to assist.",
            "The position can't be faulted. My room was so small I couldn't swing a flea let alone a cat but the positives - it was clean and close to everything. My negative was the awful bed and pillow. After walking until I couldn't walk another step I wanted a bed in which I would be comfortable to sleep but my bed resembled a block of concrete and the pillow was no softer and so thin as to be useless. The breakfast was filling if nothing and I loved the orange juice served in a plastic cup. Would I stay there again - yes but I would ask for a different room that was a bit larger and take my own pillow."

They also praised the staff for being helpful, accommodating, and friendly. Some guests even mentioned that the staff went above and beyond to ensure their stay was comfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, some guests were disappointed with the hotel's amenities, particularly the breakfast, which was described as \"so-so,\" \"basic,\" and \"not worth the 10-minute walk.\" Others found the rooms to be small, with uncomfortable beds and pillows. A few guests also experienced issues with the hotel's apartment, which was described as \"very basic\" and \"not worth the price.\"\n\nDespite the mixed reviews, many guests would still recommend the hotel to others, citing its convenient location, cleanliness, and friendly staff.

            "This deluxe Marriott at the end of the Via Veneto is a classy experience by anyone's standards. Contrary to some comments posted elesehwere the hotel is trivial to access by public transport with an underground/metro entrance across the street (though it connects to a tunnel that is around a quarter mile walk to the spanish steps metro station). I would recommend the first time user starting from the hotel rather than the station, learning the tunnel, and then it is easy after that, a bit of a maze and you need to find the right borghese escalator to get to the front door of the hotel). So, with the cheap and reliable metro access to all of the sites you will want to visit (Varican, colliseum, so on for only 1 Euro per ride) the other pluses are that this is a relatively calm and classy area of Rome, no one hustling you, plentiful expensive and also value restaurants to choose from, a safe, ATM filled neightborhood with the old Roman wall outside the door. The concierge and front deck folks were courteous and of Marriott standards, which may sound obvious but in Rome sometimes that is appreciated! This is an expensive hotel and one of the premier Marriott properties, but I would go back in an instant, I am a Marriott frequent guest but I do see the faults at some of their properites, there were none to be found here (with perhaps the exception that the gym is somewhat lame, if you feel the need to have the full equipped workout room this hotel disappoints in that area versus many other Marriotts).",
            "My wife and I recently stayed at the Flora on a short stop-over in Rome to elsewhere in Italy. The room was very nice and large by European standards, overlooking a large park. The bathroom and public areas were exceptionally nice. We stayed on hotel loyalty points and were upgraded to the executive level. Breakfast on the top level overlooked the city and the view, food, and service were all tremendous. The staff was very polite and helpful in resolving a luggage issue with our airline. This is not the most convenient location in Rome, but it is in a very attractive area that is quieter than a lot of the city. I would very much recommend this hotel.",
            "We stayed at the Grand Flora in June 2007, using a Marriott European sampler. Hard to get nights at this property for points, so we lucked out (I am platinum, not sure if that helps). Staff was very friendly and helpful, and while (as other have said) the breakfast was not anything to write home about, it was free and afforded spectacular views of the city - a wonderful way to start your day in Rome. The location was great, as Rome is a very \"walk-able\" city. The rooms are a bit tired and warn and the beds are hard, but the bath was lovely, and the view of the Villa Borghese (park) from the window alcove was stunning. Loved the huge windows and the fact that you could throw them open and sit on the wide stone edging outside of the window. We were on the second floor and did not hear any street noise when the windows were closed. Note: part of the Via Venetto was closed during our first 2 days due to Bush's state visit, so it was even quite when the windows were open! Not sure if I would pay $500 a night, but I certainly feel I made good use of my Marriott points!",
            "This was a great place to stay while visiting Rome, we would highly recomend it. My wife and I stayed there for 6 nights and it was a terrific location with a terrific staff. It is on the Via Venetto and right outside of the Villa Borguese Park, where I went running every morning and you have one of Fodor's pick for museums in Rome. Other places, the farthest walk you will ever have is 30 minutes and that is to the Vatican. We planned our walking trips around different paths to make the walk worth while. Addtionally, the hotel is down the street from the US Embassy. The room that we were in was huge, probably one of the largest hotel rooms we had stayed at. One reviewer said that the JW Marriott was better on Capri and you really can't compare. We liked Capri and the JW Marriott there better, but I would attribute that to personal taste. Also, the business center computers are free. A rarity for any hotel. A suggestion, Rome is a noisy City and if you are a light sleeper then I suggest try to get an inside room. While it is going to be darker during the day, it will be quieter and who cares if you are gone looking at the sites most of the days. If you are on an outside room, like us, then make sure you close the heavy draperies at night they will insulate the sound. The Beds are not the new Marriott beds, but the International Hotels usually lag behind the American. We had a King size bed, but was really 2 twins pushed together, a European thing. We would definately stay there again while visiting Rome, however our next trip will to return to Capri to stay at the JW Marriott.",
            "We stayed at the Grand Flora with Marriott points, so it was great value for us. We were traveling with 2 teenagers and thus needed 2 rooms. We booked the rooms 10 months prior to our arrival and requested the 2 rooms be next to each other, if not connected. We ended up having our children's room 3 doors down and only 1 room was available when we checked-in around 3pm. The rooms were very nice. Our children's room was standard but our room was very spacious with a little sitting area. The management even sent a box of chocolate and a bottle of wine to our room, since my husband has elite status. A very nice touch. The bathroom was also very clean and nice, bed was very comfortable. Our room came with complimentary rooftop breakfast, but our children did not get that and we were not willing to shell out 30 euros each, so we took turn to eat breakfast. The rooftop restaurant was very pleasant, with a great view. There were plenty of food but we did not find the breakfast food of very high quality. There was a swarm of ants near one of the juice dispensers, kind of disgusting over the crisp and super white linens. We ate outside at the terrace and for a second we were away to get something, a big seagull came zooming down to grab our food. So, make sure at least 1 person sitting at the table if you still want the food. I found the location not very desirable. It is true that the hotel is near 2 metro stations. However, metro stop Barberiini is a bit of a climb back to the Hotel and metro stop Spagna is a long walk through the tunnel to/from the Spanish Steps, very quiet at night. If we have to pay for the hotel, we probably prefer to stay a bit closer to action. I would recommend this hotel to a friend if he/she can stay with points. If they have to pay, there are other choices, provided the Grand Flora is not cheap.",
            "For starters, I was traveling for business but got a great rate of 269 Euros, breakfast not included. Positives: The staff is fantastic, very good customer service. Very friendly and five star quality. Location is very good...but not spectacular as everyone described. I think I would have preferred to be closer to the Trevi Fountain or The Spanish Steps. Negatives: I arrived late after traveling and ordered room service. 35 Euros (about $50 USD) for the smallest pizza, bottle of water and glass of red wine. Tiny. And not very good. Also, my room was TINY. My suitcase wouldn't even fit between the bed and the TV, I had to lift it over. Finally, the bedding and the shower are in serious need of an update. I can't believe they would have such outdated ammenities in a five star hotel. Luckily, I didn't really pay five star price...because it wouldn't have been worth it. However, for what I paid it was very comfortable and clean, in a fine location and the staff was extremely friendly. If you have a choice, The Westin is right up the street and looks better.",
            "Although this hotel is bit pricier than others, it's truly an excellent choice if you are traveling with your kids. We recently traveled with our 15 & 11 yr. old kids. They were happy to get an \"american\" size room with a huge sitting area (presidential suite). The staff was incredibly helpful and professional. The location was ideal. We were close to the park and a beautiful part of Rome that was just a bit away from all the crazy traffic and all the overwhelming tour groups. I would certainly stay here again! !",
            "I found this hotel on trip advisor. I was originally scheduled to stay at another well know hotel that the reviews were not so good so I changed to this property. I loved my room. Reception and check in were excellent. In room dinning and the Cabiria Restaurant had great food and service. All good!",
            "The Marriott Grand Flora in Rome is a beautiful hotel in a great location in Rome. The hotel staff was great! Hotel restaurant was very nice, but so many other fantastic restaurants in the area. I highly recommend this property if you're staying in Rome.",
            "My husband and I traveled to Italy in February. We stayed at this hotel using points. We were upgraded to a suite. The room was a corner room in the from of the hotel. We were one floor below the rooftop restaurant. So we had the smells of bacon and coffee every morning. Also, breakfast was included with our stay. It was a large spread with eggs, meats, cheeses, breads, fruits and juices. The staff at this hotel were very helpful. They were really helpful with reservations and updates on closings since we were there during the snow storm. Our views from our hotel room looked over the Villa Borghese. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. It was a great stay!"

            "My husband, two kids (ages 9 and 11) and Iarrived at this hotel last minute without a reservation at 7am on a Friday morning. We were very fortunate to find this place during the weekend of the Dew Tour. The lady at the front desk was very kind and there were plenty of staff available to help with people checking in and out. The lady helping us provided us with a reservation for that day (checkin at 4pm) but allowed us to checkin at 7am so my husband and I could get some rest since we had been driving all night. The room was very clean! Spacious bathroom and plenty of clean towels for all of us. We did not have an ocean view room, but with the way the hotel is designed we could still see the ocean from our room. There was a refrigerator in the room along with a coffee maker and a variety of coffee packets and vending machines on each floor. The kids loved the arcade and the indoor and outdoor pool. The staff at the pool was excellent providing us with towels so we did not have to take our beach towels from the beach to the pool and treck all the sand back to the pool with us - which we thought was great! We would def. stay here again.",
            "I last stayed at The Grand in Aug of 2009. The last time I stayed, I booked an ocean front room. I like to look out of the balcony and people watch or listen to the waves crash at night. This time around I booked my vacation late and there weren't any ocean front rooms available. We had an ocean view room which you can still see the ocean and the boardwalk from. Everything was pretty much the same as last time. The rooms clean, the staff is friendly, the pool is a little on the smaller side but the outside pool bar is fantastic. The one issue I had was some of the other guest. On both sides of our room we had loud quest. They came in at night at very early hours, obviously drunk and rowdy. Two doors down, a guest had passed out drunk in his chair on the balcony. The ocean front rooms are only about $10 more a night and I would of gladly spent the extra money to not have to deal with that nonsense. My assumption is that a better class of people would stay at the ocean front rooms. Its not something that the hotel can really control (who stays there) and it was just a minor annoyance. Not something I would hold against the hotel itself. Its still a pretty good hotel situated right on the boardwalk, great location, fairly clean rooms, friendly staff and awesome pool bar.",

The hotel staff is extremely friendly from the moment you call to make a reservation, during your stay, until the time you check out. The entire staff is always great to deal with, however, during this particular visit, Fay at the front desk went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. She was extremely friendly and accommodating. It was so nice to meet someone who really enjoys their job and does it well!!! When we checked out, Fay had a birthday card from the hotel and a piece of cake for my husband. Her kindness and thoughtfulness speaks volumes for the type of service you'll receive. The Grand is fortunate to have an employee as fantastic as she! You will enjoy staying here - and if you're lucky, Fay will greet you when you arrive.",

Don't mind bikers, don't mind churches, do mind loud music 24-7 and the all night party the hotel and city aloud in their garage parking, by-the-way, can't park out front of the hotel.

I booked anextra room for my hospitality suite one night and the staff cleared out the beds and replaced the beds with rounds and chairs for my guests.

The rooms are large, very DARK, so dark it was hard to see to iron my clothing. Dark red carpet (stained), very dark furniture (from the 80's) and dark red and green comforters on the beds, makes it so gloomy! The price refects the shape of the property. There is a new Hilton right down the road that was 289.00 per night during this same week and the rate here was about 100 bucks, my vote, pay the extra for the name brand hotel. This property is in sad shape, I just went to the 6th floor to check out the \"shipwreck\" restaurant, it was closed, and through the door, I could see dirt on the floor and a broken glass window inside, yes, a shipwreck.",

Our room was musty, the bed was terrible, had wrinkled carpet, ripped wallpaper, stains on the ceiling, broken tile in the bathroom, and a sliding door to the balcony that could only be unlocked and locked with much effort. This was the upgraded room that we were given after refusing to stay in the second floor room that we were given at check-in. It appears that there is no form of maintenance at all in the rooms. There are two pools that are nice other than they are used by anyone (not hotel guests) that wants to use them. The hotel restrooms and exterior showers are also used by anyone and everyone in the area. This would not be a problem if the hotel guests were not impacted by \"public\" use of all of the amenities that we paid for. There was never a hotel employee around at the pools, restrooms, or showers to check to see who was a guest and who was not. If you want to wait by the outside shower to clean off your feet after being at the beach while a family of 10 showers (soap and shampoo included) this is the place for you. I took my son to the game room and we could only find two out of the many games available that would actually work. I would not be so disappointed by the condition of the hotel if I had pulled off of 95 and got a $59.00 room. We paid well over $200.00 per night. I would not recommend this hotel at all.",
            "Stayed here for a family beach weekend this summer. It will be our new home for trips to OCMD. The hotel is located on the boardwalk but, unlike other hotels closer to the attractions, it's not like playing a game of Frogger to cross to the beach. It was within easy walking distance to everything we needed - restaurants, snacks, miniature golf - and a very doable walk down to the end of the boardwalk. A bonus is that it's the only round hotel so it's easy to spot when walking the beach or boards. Our room was clean and spacious with a great ocean view. There's no privacy between balconies on the lower floors so sitting outside can be awkward. The upper floors appeared to have screens to remedy that. The 2nd floor rooftop pool was fantastic with a full bar and towel service. We were there several times each day for a dip. See you next summer, Grand Hotel!"

            "Excellent service with a real smile, at the desk, for breakfast and at the door. In the heart of old town Montreal, next to the Cathedral close to most restaurants. The rooms have a large bed and a good quality pullout for a family. The lofty shape is trendy, allows for light to enter the room, but does not have some level of privacy for a family. A kitchenette may be handy for some, but could have done without.",
            "First off, I want to say that the hotel is a nice property, with great staff, in a beautiful area. But, I think it really depends what you are looking for, and what your preference is. For my wife and I, we didn't realize until staying at st. sulpice that we prefer a cozy (but good size) hotel room over a suite hotel room with kitchenette, and living area space. I think these rooms are ideal for people who have a family, or have friends over to enjoy a drink before a night on the town. If thats the case, st. sulpice can't be beat. As for the location, it's ideal for old montreal, but it's still a 20 minute walk or so up to saint catherine. There are many other hotels which are located more in the middle (10 minutes to old montreal, 10 minutes to downtown). But again, if staying in Old Montreal is your thing, the location can't be beat. Another thing which I noticed on tripadvisor were the comments about the murphy bed. I agree, there is simply no need for it, and it's not all that comfortable. The room is big enough, I won't need to put the bed back into the wall to save space? Also, the shower 'wall' which you can see the shadows from the living room just doesn't make alot of sense. I'm into chic and trendy things, but I found this unnecessary. So, I don't want to be too hard on st. sulpice (I did give it 4) because although it's not exactly what my wife and I were looking for, it could be ideal for others.",
            "My wife and I had 2 stays here over a 2 week period on a trip that began and ended in Montreal. The staff and the location are fantastic. The rooms are beautifully appointed albeit with some questionable furniture pieces. Staying in 2 different rooms gave us a better perspective of things as they have used the same funiture to address different room configurations. We actually had 2 tvs in the second room - #614 which I highly recommend. Facing the inner courtyard is a good idea as it is very quiet in spite of the ambient noise of the air conditioning exhaust. Facing St Paul St can be a very noisy experience. The balconies are small but serviceable. A really nice touch is the L'Ocitanne toiletries that are provided as well as the complementry bottled water that is delivered every evening. The Chateau Frontenac in Quebec was charging $8 for a bottle in the room. Some other reviews have been critical of the continental breakfast but we found it quite good and it is complementry. There is a breakfast menu for those wanting a full breakfast. The concierges were really helpful, courteous and well informed, as were the rest of the front desk staff. The valet staff were also first class and the car came quickly when requested. The bang for the buck in this hotel is outstanding, I have already booked it for a business trip in August.",
            "The staff are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and courteous... they truly know what customer service means. The location is phenomonal... in the heart of the beautiful old city. The rooms are warm, spacious with good amenities... the attention to detail in all aspects are commendable. I travel often but usually just stay at the must economic choice. This place was worth splurging on... an amazing weekend.",
            "My husband and I stayed at the Sulpice after Christmas through the New Year and were absolutely in love with it! We were given an upgraded room because it was our honeymoon so we had a huge room with fireplace, balcony (winter so not really useful), a separate bedroom, separate shower with huge soaker tub and a very well stocked kitchenette. The service was absolutely unbeatable....the staff were always polite, helpful and very prompt if we needed wood, towels or reservations. We were surprised with a unique New Years Gift and were always delighted with the turn down service with weather report in the evenings! The free breakfast was okay, we prefer Eggspectations, but free is free! We did not eat in the restaurant for dinner, but heard others rave about it. We also used the massage therapists in the gym and both my husband and I had amazing massages that were well worth the money. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the Sulpice and would stay there again, actually we are planning our next trip to Montreal already!",
            "Picked the hotel after finding a good on line deal and reading strong reviews from other travelers. I didnt see any issues with carpeting or age of the rooms as others had noted. I think we got a recently renovated room. Room was great, concierge (Ettien?) was excellent he reall understood what we were looking for in restaurants and shopping, and the location cant be beat. My only issue would be that we were on the first floor facing the street so our room was a bit noisy and we couldnt not open our curtains. Otherwise great boutique hotel..",
            "This was our first visit to Montreal and we chose Le Saint Sulpice based on the glowing tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed! Our room was actually a small apartment--separate bedroom, living room w/electric fireplace, kitchenette, balcony overlooking the outdoor dining area and gardens and a large, extremely well appointed bath. Grohe fixtures, a beautiful molded glass vanity, large tub and an enormous shower. There was plenty of closet and drawer space, the furnishings were very nice and the queen bed was comfortable with high quality linens. As a coffee addict, I especially appreciated a large, 12 cup coffee maker supplied with a more than acceptable blend--no tiny pot dribbling out foul brown water like most hotels. The location of the hotel is superb--right next to Notre Dame, an easy walk to the Metro and in the heart of Old Montreal. My only quibbles: some of the walls were scarred in places and in need of repair and paint and the carpet was stained and frayed in spots. As a previous reviewer noted, pets are allowed in some of the rooms and I suspect the carpet issues can be attributed to that. All in all--a very pleasant experience in a wonderfully unique city.",
            "I recently returned from Montreal after honeymooning for about a week at Le Saint Sulpice. The hotel was magnificent! My husband called in advance of our trip to request an early check-in, and we were able to get into our room upon arrival. We had a deluxe suite on the 4th floor that faced the courtyard. The bathroom was very nice with a large bathtub and huge shower. The bedroom was small, but very cozy and romantic. The bed was amazingly comfortable. We also had a fireplace and a lovely balcony. I highly recommend a balcony. I spent a lot of time sipping my morning coffee and evening wine while watching the activity in the courtyard. On another note, continental breakfast was included with our rate and available in the restaurant until 11:00 AM. And, nightly turn-down service was provided. Le Saint Sulpice is perfectly located in the heart of Vieux Montreal. Highlights located nearby include the museum Pointe-\u00c3\u00a0-Calli\u00c3\u00a8re, the bar at the Hotel Place d'Armes, and the restaurant Le Club Chasse et Peche. Make sure to escape the tourists, though, and head to other areas of town. We had great bagels in Montreal's Mile-End neighborhood and smoked meat sandwiches at Schwartz's on St. Laurent. For a fabulous brewpub, go to Dieu du Ciel on Laurier Ave. For sushi, go to Jun I, also on Laurier. The English area of town around Crescent Street is also worth checking out. We bar hopped starting at the Winston Churchill Pub . For a clubby, Manhattan-ish experience, go to Cavalli on Peel. For you gamblers, spend an evening at the massive Casino de Montreal. We won!",
            "We recently spent two nights at the Saint Sulpice. The hotel is located in Old Montreal so we could walk everywhere. We had a three room suite (BR, LR/Kitchenette and Bath) that was like having our own apartment. There is a real neighborhood feel to the area and we were right around the corner from the Notre Dame Basilica. There are many restaurants in the area, plus we found a grocery store and a pharmacy within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. The staff was courteous and helpful and the service excellent. We plan to return to Montreal and will stay in the Saint-Sulpice.",
            "Our son and daughter-in-law arranged a 50th wedding anniversary celebration at the hotel. The staff was uniformly helpful and gracious. There were 18 of us (including children) and when we checked in the concierge welcomed us personally and wished us happy anniversary. We were extraordinarily fortunate and the weather was warm and sunny the whole weekend. We were able to have our before dinner drinks and canapes on the terrace. The celebration dinner at the hotel was excellent. Each evening bottled water was placed next to the beds - something one never gets even at the most upscale hotels in Europe. I have a theory that there is a correlation between the quality of hotels and towels: the towels were wonderful. The continental breakfast was fine although it would have been nice to have had rolls as a choice. Some of our party ordered cooked breakfasts which looked quite nice. One afternoon some of us had lunch on the terrace. Although service was slow, the food was good. Our one caveat: there is deferred maintenance and the carpets in the room should be replaced as should some of the couches, especially in our daughter's room. Our room, though, was perfect as we had been upgraded. The location in the heart of Old Montreal, near restaurants and the waterfront, was superb. If we ever returned to Montreal there is no question we would stay at this hotel."

            "I arranged for our small staff to stay at the Hotel Regina during a convention in June of 2008. Even before we arrived, the staff at the hotel was very responsive to questions that we sent via email, etc. Once we arrived, I was again pleasantly surprised at how nice and helpful the staff was. The lobby was small, but very well kept and beautiful. The rooms were comfortable and really modern, clean and nice. The internet was free, so that was great as well! The hotel is in a great area, very close to the Catalonia Ramblas. It wasn't very close to the convention center, but the subway was close and easy to use.",
            "We stayed here one night pre cruise on June 13, 2009. The hotel has a great location near the top of Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. Our room wasn't ready as we arrived in the morning, but they will gladly stored our luggage for us. We had a family room which was a large room with four comfortable beds (two of the beds were pushed together to form a queen size bed) so all four of us could stay in one room. The bathroom was good sized and had wonderful amenities (shampoo, lotions, and individual toiletry kits for gentleman and ladies). There are also three computers with internet access available for free us which was convenient. The only problem with the room is that the air conditioning did not work very well and the room was hot (it was 78 degrees F in the room most of the time). Fortunately, we were so tired that we slept fine anyways. The staff was fairly friendly and called a taxi for us when we departed the next day for the pier.",

Staff and also interior of the hotel is nice but we were little bit disapointed from family room. We had family room on the 4th floor and it was not very spacious and comfortable. But every other things were ok...",

It was very spacious and clean and had a big bathroom and lots of room to spread out. Sadly we only stayed one night but we had excellent service from the very friendly staff. We asked a lot of questions for getting around Barcelona and they were extremely helpful. They also have a room (and great organization) where you can lock your bags up securely if needed (we checked out but were not heading to our cruise ship until late in the day). One reason we chose this hotel was the location but we did worry about the noise - there was no need to! It was quiet even with the location so close to Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas! I would definitely stay here again! Oh and the beds were quite comfortable!",
            "Cannot beat the location for this nicely furnished comfortable hotel just of the Plaza Catalunya. Close to the Ramblas without the noise and very near shopping, airport bus and tour buses. Flat screen tv, ample size rooms with comfortable beds and quiet. Only one problem. When I woke in the middle of the night to use the bathroom saw a bug in the bathroom. My only complaint. Imagine it may have come from the drain in the bathroom but still was dissappointing. In fairness to the hotel, I did not mention to the management because I didnt think there was anything they could do about this situation but did mention to housekeeping. All in all the hotel was clean",

The hotel is beautiful, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms great, slightly small but perfect for what we needed. Cleaned everyday and central heating was great. Have been recommending the hotel already! Still cannot believe the price we paid for the location and the quality. Overall had an excellent stay and will definately be back.",

Dont use the rooms near the triangle especially 1st floor-the trains rumble the floor regardless if your windows are shut. dont use the laundry service unless your willing to part with more money than your clothes are worth. Overall-depends on what deal you got for your room, because despite the cons the location is very convenient.",
            "We flew in to Barcelona and had a cruise to catch the next day. The hotel was perfect. The location was right in the heart of the city. starbucks was next door and the main city square was right out the door. They offered to do anything we asked. We were shocked how helpful and kind the staff was. the bar was warm and the lobby was clean and neat. Rooms were typical for a city. They were very clean and neat. Bathrooms were very modern and more than functionable. We are looking forward to finding a reason to go back to Barcelona and enjoy their hospitality for a longer stay. When we returned back from the cruise they stored our luggage until our flight . no charge... Very class act. they sold us on how to treat a guest - Not sure anyone can match their quality but we do travel a bit so we are using them for a benchmark. They also corrdinated private drivers to meet us everywhere we asked"

            "Stayed for two nights here last January on a city break with my partner. Hotel was in a great location, just few steps walk from San Marco and next to Rialto Great room and friendly staff also helped make our stay special. We are frequent travellers and I would definately recommend it and hope it never changes.",
            "What a fantastic hotel in a great location right near St Mark's Square but tucked away so as not to be disturbed by noise or pedestrians. The staff were fabulous and as it was just myself and my mum suggested we shared a gondola ride, which they organised, with other guests in order to save us money. They also organised a wonderful trip to Murano for us in a private speedboat for free. Murano is well worth a visit. DO NOT LEAVE once you have been to the glass factory....you must stay and visit the little town on the island. It is wonderful and much less busy then Venice. The hotel has a private launch and its perfect to sit on the bench outside watching the gondalas pass whilst enjoying a Bellini or two! The hotel was spotless and decorated in traditional venetian style. The only thing that let our room down was it was in the attic and quite small and the views although good were not over the canal. Also the bathroom was tiny, we couldn't stand in the shower!!! but it was all good fun and it would not put us off going back at all I would definately return. We did get a cheap deal so this could well be why we had the small room as I know some of the others were huge. It was my mum's 60th and she loved every minute of her stay at the Colombina and in Venice ... enjoy :)",
            "Location was perfect. 2 mins walk if that from St Marks Square. The staff were fantastic and made our visit trouble free, nothing was too much for them. If you want a Gondola ride ask the hotel to book it for you direct, you can pick a time and you are picked up and returned to your hotel or a different venue if you ask them. Breakfast was ample and managed to accommodate myself who was on a strict diet a husband and two teenage children with no problem. The bar was very small but the there was another lounge that was very comfortable and the service impeccible. The rooms were comfortable and quaint without being over the top ornate, with clean towels every day and it certainly looked like clean linen every day. We never had to ask for water in our room or for them to restock the mini bar it was done without fail. We had a room on the 1st floor whilst the children on the top, both rooms were very quiet and people were very considerate when returning to the hotel late or the sound proofing was extra good. One piece of advice, if you opt for a water taxi ask them to take you direct to your hotel as most drop off at St Marks Square and it is a maze of alleys. We took a water taxi who dropped us off at the door of our hotel which took about 35 mins and cost Euros 85 for 4 people. The same people on our flight took another taxi who dropped them off at St Marks Square and it took them about 2 hours to locate the hotel. Once again thank you to the staff at the Colombina and would we return to this hotel, without a doubt I would not even considerable another one.",
            "My husband and I spent 3 nights here in November 2005. We had lots of luggage so we took a private taxi at the end of the pier. It cost us 95,00 euro from the airport each way!!! We had a deluxe room on the top floor that overlooked the canal and the St. Mark's church. We really enjoyed the hotel, it is nice. The room was good size and nicely decorated.The bathroom was nice.Breakfast was nice and the staff was very pleasant.I would recommend this hotel.",
            "Excelent Hotel. An amazing location . Our Room was an attic room, beautifull and very comfortable, however the tub was a little unconfortable. It had a view of the Plaza San Marco. Breakfast was great and very well attended and included. Take advantage of the \"Complementary\" trip to murano. It includes a tour of a glass factory and their showroom and you can come back to Venice on the Vaporeto, the public water bus. great restaraunts around and also a small grocery store. But like evrything in venice be ready to carry your suitcases, everywere..",
            "My husband and I escorted a group of 40 guests of various ages from 45 to 80 to Venice in early October 09 and stayed at the Hotel Columbina for a pre night stay to a cruise that we were all going on. I contacted Marco approximately a year prior to our arrival and he was without a doubt one of the most gracious hosts that I have worked with from the very beginning of our planning all the way through to our stay at the hotel. Marco had arranged private water taxi's for all our guests and met us on his own time at the airport to insure that the transfer to the hotel went seamlessly. He personally put all our luggage on board the water taxi's making it a very pleasant experience for our guests. Our guests loved just walking off the water taxi and directly into the hotel. Hotel staff met each water taxi with warm smiles and an incredible welcome and manged getting all luggage marked and delivered to our rooms without any isses. All hotel reservations were completed by Marco prior to our arrival and room keys were handled in an expedient manner. Our rooms were very comfortable and beautifully arranged with lovely Venitian furniture, drapes and matching bed linens that you would expect in a 4 star hotel. Marco pre arranged private gondola rides for our guests in the latter part of the afternoon, followed by a great cocktail reception enjoyed by all in their lovely lobby area. Later that evening we all enjoyed an exceptional Venitian dinner with entertainment at one of the oldest Venice Restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel again all personally arranged by Marco. In the morning we all enjoyed the lovely breakfast buffet prior to prearranged water taxis picking us up for a transfer to the ships terminal. I give the Hotel Columbina a 5+ review overall but would like to give Marco a special recognition for all he did to make our stay perfect in every way. We cannot wait to go back again!",
            "On our recent stay, we had a delightful experience at the Hotel Colombina. Our room was decorated with antique furniture, fabric covered walls, a marble bath and shuttered windows opening on to a little used canal. There is a bridge over the canal almost at the hotel's doorstep that quickly leads to a street filled with restaurants and on to St. Marks Square and the Grand Canal. Breakfast offers a variety of things to eat in two well appointed dining rooms. The staff was courteous, helpful, and professional. Overall, we were happy with our choice of hotel in Venice.",
            "Our hotel was conveniently located two short streets off St. Mark's Square on the Bridge of Sigh's Canal. Very comfortable room, good breakfast, and the staff very helpful. Front desk booked Murano tour, gondola ride- picked up at hotel dock- so convenient. Only stayed two nights but best visit to Venice yet.",
            "Most of what I read on trip advisor before booking was true, great location, clean, friendly, great service. We also got horribly lost trying to find the hotel, despite having already seen it from one of the canals - definitely print out the directions before you go! I had booked a standard room in the main building for our stay, but was really disappointed when I saw the room, it was a loft room and the ceiling was very low in parts, it felt really claustrophobic. The bathroom was hilarious, you couldn't stand up to have a shower (I am only 5ft 6) and had to sit in the bath instead! I lost count of the amount of times I banged my head, once really badly on the way out to the roof terrace. The room's private roof terrace is what saves it (and lets them get away with charging the price they do for it) as it is lovely, spacious, and you get an amazing view over the rooftops of Venice. You can also have breakfast on it for an additional 6 euros. Overall we were really pleased with the hotel, but I think they should have warned us about the room, and give people the choice over whether they want a roof terrace or to walk around without getting concussion!",
            "The location is perfect , close to the Piazza San Marco and Rialto Bridge. We made a great choise, the staff was friendly, principally Mr. Marco Ive who even tried to speak portuguese with us. The rooms are confortable and clean. My birthday was perfect in that place I'll never forget! Great city, hotel and people!"

            "We have stayed at this hotel 3 times now and were pleased each time. Each time the front desk staff have been helpful and pleasant. The rooms have all been clean and well equipped. The free breakfast is varied and quite complete. And the distance to the French Quarter is close enough to easily walk, but far enough to be quiet. We would recommend it to anyone traveling to New Orleans.",
            "I confess that I was hesitant to book this hotel since prior experience with Quality Inns did not lead me to expect actual quality, but I carefully read the TripAdvisor reviews and decided to take the plunge. I'm so glad I did! My husband and I, joined by two friends from Australia, enjoyed five terrific days and nights in New Orleans, based at the Quality Inn & Suites. We took a bus from the airport that deposited us less than 3 blocks from the hotel. The staff had selected rooms across the hall from each other and let us look at them before we checked in to make sure they were acceptable, which they were. (On the phone, they had said the room with two queen beds is small but it was much larger than they had described!) Everything - common areas, bathrooms, bedding, hallways - was quite clean and fresh smelling. The \"continental breakfast\" was extensive with eggs, grits, and waffles in addition to muffins, toast, fruit, yogurt, cereal, juice, coffee, etc. The coffeemaker in the room created an acceptable brew too. The location was great - one or two blocks to the Canal Street and St. Charles streetcar lines and easy walking distance to all of the French Quarter. Every member of the staff we encountered was gracious, friendly and helpful. Directions and restaurant recommendations were cheerfully given. And the price just can't be beat! I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone who does not require fancy accommodations.",
            "To contradict the last review, we are in our 60's and never felt unsafe in this area of New Orleans. It's a great location just minutes from the French Quarter and the main stopping place for the Streeet Car to the Garden District. We were lucky to get an upgrade from the very efficient manager (Stanley), he loves the Hornets! and he can also advise on eating places etc. Also all of the staff were effective and friendly and the rooms were very clean. he hotel advertises a Continental Breakfast, it's more than that, Bacon, Eggs, Waffeles, Yoghurt, frest Fruit, orange Coffee, etc. etc. it is very good. Only one slight problem, if the people in the next room have an early shower, you can hear the shower running.",
            "Only 2.5 star rated Hotel but with such accomodating staff, clean rooms and away from Bourban Street - it's a very good place to stay. A free breakfast with room, Checking in early was no problem and we even got a room upgrade to a suite. Once again thanks to Stanley and his team - this was real service, not the pretend stuff you often get in Hotels!",
            "I have no complaints about the Quality Inn & Suites Downtown. We arrived late to the hotel and the manager on duty upgraded us from the double room we had booked to the queen suite. Sweet! The room was spacious with two TVs (one in the bedroom and another in the sitting area), a small couch and chair as well as a fridge, sink and iron and ironing board. The bathroom was clean and spacious. The shower had good pressure. The bed itself was comfortable, no complaints about bad sleep. There was no view but we also weren't in the hotel often anyway. The room and the hotel was very quiet. WiFi is available and the connection is on and off, but mostly sufficient if one just wants to check e-mail, etc. The staff at the hotel are super nice and attentive. When we were leaving, we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel until later in the day, and the staff called the taxi for us, which was waiting when we returned to leave for the airport. Breakfast at the hotel is complementary with the room - it's fairly basic and rudimentary (plastic plates, cups and utensils), but sufficient and serves the purpose. The location of the hotel is not perfect (perfect would be inside the French Quarter), but it's very close - about 7-8 min walk to Bourbon Street and the rest of the French Quarter. It was also safe at night - at no point did we feel unsafe. I would highly recommend this hotel, it's nothing fancy but it's more than sufficient if one is looking for a comfortable clean place to sleep that is close to all the attractions and won't break the wallet.",
            "The manager and front desk staff treated us, and all the guests, like royalty over the course of our stay. During long weekend stay, the manager made reservations at 4 different restaurants for us, opened up the fitness center during off-hours so we could sneak in a late night work-out, and ran through countless city maps with us. Although the rooms were fairly basic the suites were very large and the maid service was always very on target. The location was one of my favorite aspects of the hotel. It was a couple of blocks into downtown, between the French Quarter and Garden District, and was walk able to all my favorite spots including Magazine Street, Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Du Monde, etc. And, due to its slightly off the beaten path location, it was cheap, quite and felt like a hidden gem. The unique, welcoming and very accommodating hospitality staff was like icing on a cake. Love this great find, and amazingly priced steal!",
            "The customer service was exceptional. It is an older hotel but in very good condition with lots of charm & character. We were upgraded to a mini suite which was on the corner with a great view of the bustling downtown area. We walked to French Quarter & Riverwalk.",
            "We chose this hotel based on reviews, and while we did, indeed find the staff very courteous and delightful (they were alway polite and helpful), there isn't much they could have done for the hard beds, leaky faucets, and broken safe. Pros: - Average (but free!) hotel breakfast: continental offerings plus eggs, grits, a meat, and a waffle maker - Courteous, polite staff (I'm not sure I could say that enough - they were very good!) -Clean, decent accomodations and decor -Within walking distance of French Quarter and streetcar lines -Felt safe -Subway restaurant right next door (we didn't use it, but someone might!) Cons: -The bed was as hard as a dry river bed at the end of a 100-year drought - we could not sleep and got up in pain every morning. We almost changed hotels for this one reason. It actually affected our ability to enjoy our trip, because we hurt too much to walk everywhere! That's how bad they were. (And we're pretty healthy, well-exercised people!) -The bathroom faucet leaked all over the counter constantly -The bathroom ceiling tiles were offset and the ceiling fixtures rusty -We're used to sleeping with a fan running (white noise), but there was no \"fan\" in the bedroom. The AC control is in the living room of the suite, and it was quiet (ok, ok... I know, I 'm complaining about a hotel room being quiet at night?? Sheesh!) Overall, a nice place in the daytime, but we would not be able to stay there again because of the beds.",
            "Stayed one night....liked our room, breakfast, and location of the hotel. We stayed out late, and felt safe walking back to our hotel from Bourbon Street. The staff was friendly and very helpful in giving us directions to different places we wanted to visit. Although we weren't in town long enough to use it, there is a Subway restaurant connected to the hotel. Parking was also convenient (parking structure 1/2 block away with valet service). The hotel as well as the area was not busy during our stay.",
            "I didn't catch the front desk receptionist's name but he was amazing! He let us check in early and even upgraded our queen room to a king when he saw that I was traveling with my rather tall boyfriend :) and even apologized for the room not being too roomy so he made our parking complimentary. He was so eager to suggest places to dine and where the great jazz music is performed. We had a fantastic stay! The customer service was really refreshing since we didn't get much great service from around that area. Would definitely stay again!"

            "two married couples and a single lady needed clean, comfortable accommodation - not too expensive - for a base while touring in New York and we checked on trip advisor and found fairly good reviews on Murray Hill East Suites. We originally booked one Junior Suite and a one bedroom room because any larger rooms anywhere seemed to be too expensive. When we got to Murray Hill they offered us a two bedroom/two bathroom with sofa bed in living room so we could all go in together. Also had living room/kitchen area. Absolutely perfect! Desk staff and door man very helpful - we needed extra wine glasses and an extra frying pan and they were cheerfully provided. Close to all amenities although the three block walk to Grand Central Station seemed to get longer every time we did it. Had a room on the back of the hotel so very quiet. Kitchenette very limited facilities but great for cooking English Breakfast every day and then loading dishwasher as we went out. All in all would have no hesitation either recommending Murray Hill or staying there again if we ever go back to New York.",
            "Our family of 4 just returned from a 5-night stay at Murray Hill East Suites. It was exactly as I had expected and worked extremely well for us. As previous posters have mentioned, the furniture is a little worn and dated, but everything was very comfortable and the suite was surprisingly spacious for Manhattan. We had 1 bedroom with 2 double beds, a sofa bed in the living room, full kitchen and dining area. Times Square was only 10-15 minutes walk, and Grand Central Station was very nearby. There was a supermarket just around the corner, where we were able to purchase juice, cereal, milk and snacks, essential with a hungry teenager in the group! The staff was very courteous and requests for extra towels and kitchen utensils were met promptly. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. And the price was unbeatable too!",
            "We booked 3 adults. (2 beds and a pull out couch). When we arrived there were no linens for the pull out couch. We told the front desk and they said they would take care of it and have someone bring some sheets and pillows up. So we trusted this and went out to visit the town. When we got back at 4am, there were still no linens for the pull out couch. We told the front desk that we STILL do not have any linens. We were then informed that they do not have any more left. Apparently this hotel does not have enough linens to supply for all their guests. Needless to say it was a restless night. If you want to sleep without sheets and a pillow....this is the hotel for you.",
            "room was larger than expected, but definitely more of a 1-star after the service we recieved. One of the guests in our party had left a shirt behind in the bathroom, however when we called back the next day we were informed by thier housekeeping staff that nothing was found in the room.",
            "This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! The room was huge, with two queen size beds (although we paid for two twin beds), a big couch, two tables, full kitchen, and big bathroom. This room was bigger than my apartment in my hometown. Great value for the money. Very clean, quiet, and it had even free internet and tens of utensils in there.",
            "Stayed here 1 night right before Christmas. Although its a large room, that's about the only great thing. There's a kitchen, fridge, etc which I'm sure is handy, but we didn't really use. Large seating area, with old dingy furniture. Bed was awful, with a dip in middle. Bedding was just a sheet and blanket. Bathroom was tiny. Heat had no thermostat. It was either hot or cold. Overall there is potential but needs a major upgrade. Location is decent. Not in tourist area which is nice.",
            "I've stayed here a few times over the years. Don't expect a full-service hotel. That's not what this is. These are excellent short-term serviced apartments though. If you need a base in NYC for a few days, or even a couple of weeks, they're clean, safe and well maintained. I've always had a very large room and a small kitchen, which means I've been able to fix my own breakfast before heading out in the morning. There are ample delis, a Kinkos and Grand Central just around the corner. I've found the staff to be helpful, but not overly outgoing. There's no bar or restaurant - if you're looking for somewhere practical it's a great place to stay.",
            "I stayed here about a year ago and the room on the second floor was garbage. Torn and stained linens, dirty bathroom and carpets. This time I was on the sixth floor and things were much nicer. I'm not sure if the fixed things up or I was just lucky. You can tell this is a former apartment building. Bathroom was clean and functional. Shower was so-so. Kitchen with all necessary utensils (pot, pans, glasses, silverware) is a nice plus. There was only one small tv in the living room sitting on a cart. A bedroom tv would be nice. Orbitz had the room for $119. Rack rate was $159. Check before you book. There is a small fitness center and laundry in the basement. As the title says, thoroughly adequate.",
            "I have stayed at this apartment hotel in NYC for over 20 yrs about 5 wks per year. It is in a good neighborhood with all the conveniences....drycleaners, nail salons, shoe repairs, grocery, restaurants and delis. It is a little worn around the edges so they are finally beginning to rennovate. They have studios, 1 bedrooms and a couple 2 bedrooms. Spacious and good for families. Full kitchens and pretty clean though a little worn. You would walk by it on the street and believe it was just another apartment bldg. However the manager there is the WORST at confirming rates, taking care of problems and communicating in general. You can call 10 times and even though he knows we are valued clients he will not return calls, confirm reservations or rates. In all my years in business I have never seen a hotel behave like this. If I were you I would book over the internet and not go through him or the reservations there as I feel that is dicey. After recently being overcharged by $90 he is refusing to credit me or return my calls. That is just bad behavior and bad business. The ppl at the front desk are friendly but behind them is just bad behavior and management.",
            "My sisters and I stayed in the Murray Hill Suites during our stay in Manhattan. It is one of the nicest apartments I have stayed in. The kitchen is really well equipped, it even as a dishwasher. The apartments are a really good size and the bed was huge. there is maid service daily, which meant a clean apartments and lots of fresh towels. The apartment also has quite a good fitness centre for those who are not worn out by walking around Manhattan."

Helpful desk clerks told us how to get the Light Rail train and monorail to the downtown Seattle area and Space Needle. Two blocks up the street was a Safeway where we stocked up on wine and sodas for the cruise. Hot tub and pool were refreshing and clean. Dinner downstairs at the hotel was great -- and a wonderful buffet breakfast awaited us in the morning. Not one complaint but lots of accolades for the friendly staff and clean accommodations.",
            "I had asked for a handicap room after having had hip replacement surgery and they took very good care of me. The room was very clean and equipped with microwave, refrigerator and TV. Nice big bathroom and comfortable bed. I was at the end of the hall and heard nothing at any time. Was able to rest comfortably. The flight on US Airways was just the opposite. I needed to come home a day early due to illness and had already paid $629.00 roundtrip and they told me about the $150.00 extra charge but didn't advise me of the Add'l $207.00 they charged me for what they claimed the ticket cost would have been on that day. This isn't the first time they've ripped me off either. I hope I never have to use them again. Cost me $986.00 to go to Seattle and come home a day early, I had already paid for my ticket. They are a bunch of rip-offs.",

It was mid night and lucky enough Best Western had a room it was thirty dollars more but it was worth not feeling like you had cooties on you. Last year we tried the extended stay before the cruise and it was so gross. Finally we found a place that is clean, good parking area, nice breakfast, pretty room. We will stay here from now on before taking a cruise.",
            "Life is all about expectations! We had expected the Best Western to be worse than the nearby Holiday Inn Express down the street, where we had stayed the week before. In fact, it was an equivalent experience and a lower price. We had expected the breakfast to be only coffee and rolls, but there was a better (typical) breakfast buffet in a restaurant room instead. The bus to the airport was fine. The rooms were a bit dated but spacious. Room rate was only $84 plus tax.",

The staff has never minded helping us tourist with directions of how to get somewhere and have been very accommodating when it has come to room requests. They also have a shuttle that will pick you up at the airport and also take you to wherever else you need to go to eat or catch another form of transporation to get into the city. As long as they keep it up, they will keep being our place of choice to stay for our Seattle trips.",

Much cheaper then airport parking. When we pulled up I was a little nervous as the front part of the hotel was ripped apart. Looked like they were getting ready to start renos. We booked here as they offer a stay park package, free 24 hour shuttle and indoor pool. Upon arrival we found out the pool was closed, my son was very disappointed as this was one of the main reasons we booked here. Room was very clean. beds was comfortable. Front desk staff on check in were very friendly and efficent. We checked out on May 10th at 3am. We had a very early flight. The gentlemen checking us out was very rude and snappy with us. He tried to charge my cedit card a second time even though I pre paid on line. I had to go through my suite cases to get the proof which I had already provided at check in. We did use the shuttle to get us to the airport. The shuttle driver was amazing. Very friendly. He went out of his way to ensure we knew were to be picked up from on our return. Thanks so much to him for his great service. When we arrived back at SEA TAC the same shuttle driver picked us up. He was amazing and very helpful with his directions to get us back ont he freeway home again.",
            "We arrived very late at night -- after midnight. We waited a tolerable 10 minutes for shuttle pick-up, and hotel check in was quick. The free breakfast offered ample choices but was also VERY crowded. The morning shuttle driver took me to a nearby laundromat and picked me up later as well. This was super helpful. The hotel in general could use a little updating; however, I would stay there again....",

The hotel is close by the airport and convenient when you need to stay over night and fly. There is a nice computer room where you can print your boarding passes etc. There is no fast food or convenience stores located anywhere near the hotel. The hotel does have its own restaurant prices not that bad. They do have a great breakfast with cereal, muffins, waffels and baking powder biscuits and gravy and its all very clean and orderly.",
            "The hotel was clean and nice. Staff was good. We stayed here twice - one night each. They provide free continental breakfast which helped. There is also a free shuttle to and from the airport which is 5 minutes from here. And the airport now has a light rail to downtown so that is a very economical way to get to downtown from here. You can take the monorail from there to get to the space needle if needed.",
            "We stayed here on a visit to Seattle. The plus for us was free shuttle to the Light Rail system and the airport. The shuttle and drivers were awesome. The left the hotel every half-hour (make a reservation, they'll look for you before leaving) but pick you up whenever you call. It's about a 10 minute ride to the airport. The light rail to downtown ran very often, was clean and quiet. I think it took about 30 minutes to get to downtown. The room was fine - pool great (and almost no one used it -don't worry there is a camera watching from the desk) - wireless access or complimentary computer access - breakfast was fine. We were told later that this is not an area to be walking in after dark - not a problem for me - I'd rather be swimming. A very helpful clerk even printed our boarding passes for us when we couldn't get the printer in the computer room to work."

            "This is one of our favorite getaway spots...we were there on Halloween weekend, and there was a totally delightful parade down the main street, adding to the overall charm of the weekend! Calistoga is always full of surprises! There are three mineral pools at Roman Spa; two with jets, and one that is a swimming pool. It was raining while we were there, and they supply umbrellas if you want to use the outdoor pool! It is always a great time, even in the rain!",
            "The hotel is centrally located in town and has it's own spa called the Baths. Love their mineral bath and massages. The best thing about the Roman spa is the mineral pool and therapy spa. We love to go down after dinner and hang out in the pool, it is delightful.",
            "We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Roman Spa. I have not kept count but I would guess that this is our 20 + stay. We usually go twice a year for a family reunion of cousins which Calistoga is pretty central. The help is fantastic. All the way from the office to the maid and grounds men. Friendly, willing to help and very helpful if needed. The facilities are kept in perfect condition. For example, each morning the maid group go around and wipe the outdoor tables and chairs as well as the pool funature of dust and dew. These is a beautiful patio area with eating tables and Weber BBQ [bricketts] as well as a gas cooking facility. These are cleaned daily. Rooms are very clean, made up efficiently and we have never had any problems of any type at the facilities. They have three heated pools, one large outdoor, medium indoor and a hot tub type thing. I'm sure that you could find something less expensive although in my opinon, Roman Spa is not expensive, but you will not find anything with the amenities that it has for the price. [They even have loaner umbrtells in stredgit location when the weather in inclement] Can't wait to go back in the spring.",
            "My family and I have been coming to the Roman Spa for approximately 8 years. Every New Years we come for a four day visit. We spend a great deal of time in and around the hot spring fed pools and jacuzzi's. The staff has essentially remained the same throughout the time we have been coming to the the Roman Spa. They are friendly and helpful. While young family members are welcome the Roman Spa encourages these youngsters to behave themselves in and around the pool areas so as to not disprupt the serenity of the grounds. The rooms are clean, modern, and are kept up. There are kitchenettes in some units, kitchens in others, and some just have a microwave & small refrigerator. There is no free WiFi internet available which is something that I would encourage the Roman Spa to take a look at adding in the future. However they do have a PC in the lobby for guests to check their emails, which is a good alternative. The actual Spa treatments are next door and the one thing I would encourage is for a small price break for spa treatments to Roman Spa Resort guests. As it is folks that come in off the street pay the same rates for spa treatments as resort guests. My suggestion is make it more enticing for a resort guest to do a spa treatment especially ones that are staying multiple nights. All in all, I have no complaints. The Resort is very clean, the grounds and landscaping are fantastic, with a Spanish/Mission style motif. There is adequate parking and everything in town is within walking distance.",
            "We spent 4 days at the Roman Spa on our honeymoon and had a most wonderful time. Be aware - this is not one of the big hotel chains so no fancy high tech facilities, no wi-Fi and no restaurant What you do get is VERY comfortable accommodation, kitchenette - excellent little supermarket around the corner so you can eat in (Healthier & cheaper) without restrictions on menus etc. The staff were helpful and friendly and the spa is for being thoroughly spoiled! And the location is close to everything",
            "We live in Ashland Oregon and often visit family in the San Francisco Bay Area. We stopped in Calistoga some 17 years ago on our way home from SF and stayed at the Roman Spa. We so enjoyed the beautiful grounds and the 3 mineral pools that we make it a point to visit at least once and sometimes twice a year. The Roman Spa and Calistoga is our favorite spot in the Wine Country.",
            "My daughter, three of her friends, and Mother (me) traveled to the wine country for three days of wonderful good food,refreshing body treatments and total relaxation. The Roman Spa is truly a remarkable experience for adults. The rooms are emaculate and well appointed and the three therapy pools also beautifully kept with grounds and flowers to equal the islands. We were able to barbeque our meals and dine elegantly. Thank you Roman Spa!!!!!!! !",
            "We hadn't stayed at the Roman Spa For some time but thought it was time to give them another try. In the last few years we have stayed at Dr. W's, the Calistoga Spa, and Solage. Our room was clean and comfortable and the bed actually firm [! ]...features that are to be expected. But the pools were at perfect temperatures, one warm, one intermediate and one HOT. Again features that are expected in Calistoga... What sets the Roman Spas apart though is the service that the staff provides and the grounds. Every employee that we encountered was working hard to provide an environment that is relaxing. The grounds are simply amazing! Pots of tulips and daffodils in full bloom; other plantings well cared for; pathways clean and swept. Many small things but the sum is a great place to stay in Calistoga. AAA gives it 3 stars; I give it 4! Will we stay there again?? You can bet on It! !",
            "My friends and I have been enjoying the Roman Spa for over two decades now, and it does not disappoint. The staff is friendly and the maid service is efficient (we were gone for an hour for breakfast and by the time we returned the room was cleaned). The three spa pools offer different temperatures (large outdoor pool is 92-95 degrees, the medium indoor pool about 100 degrees, and the small outdoor jacuzzi is 104 degrees). There are also separate men's and women's saunas. While the rooms could use a style update, ours was clean and had a small but nice bathroom. Our room had a kitchenette which was convenient, but since the spa is located only steps away from a variety of restaurants (high, medium and low end), we just used it for the refrigerator and early morning coffee. What has always been the draw for us, besides the pools, is the landscaping. There beautiful dark wood vine arbors and there are always seasonal plantings. At this time of year, the mums are plentiful. Pumpkins had been placed abundantly in the gardens, including a monster big one outiside the office door. I was hoping for cooler fall weather, but had to live with glorious, sunny mid 80s weather during my stay. Oh well, that just means coming back again later this winter when I can count on a chill in the air even mid-day.",
            "We checked in and things were fine, people at the front desk were nice and helpful. It is a block off the main street with a ton of places to eat, so that was nice. When we got to the room, the door was open - wide open, which I think was strange. The room was very clean. It needs an update, new decor, the whole 9. The room was also dark, even with the curtains open, so we had to have lights on all the time. The bed was HARD! I had to toss and turn because my sides and back would hurt. The grounds were nice. Lots of plants everywhere. We went in the \"mineral pools\" but there was a strong chlorine smell, so we didn't stay in very long, plus there were kids everywhere, so it was hard to just relax and enjoy the warm water. There were a lot of families with children, which was fine, but they were running amok all over. I over heard a conversation with a hotel staff member and a guest, and apparently someone let their kids sleep in the car in the parking lot all night! All in all the stay was OK... I am not happy I paid almost $200 for 1 night, but it was Memorial Day weekend... The website made the place look like a resort, and I must say... it is FAR from a resort! I would stay again, but I would never pay that much again!"
