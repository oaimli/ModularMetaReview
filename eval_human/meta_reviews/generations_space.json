            "Just returned today from a 4 night stay in Seattle at the Four Seasons. The service is typical Four Seasons, always there when you need them, with few flaws. The only complaint is the shower water pressure. I felt it was low, but my partner thought it was perfect. The bathroom is huge, with one of the deepest tubs I've ever seen in a hotel. The bathroom mirror has a television built into it. Great idea! Lights are on dimmers in every room. The view of Puget Sound was perfect. The front desk staff addressed me by name every time I passed the desk, and always with a smile. The business center was spotlessly clean, and offered new computers and printers. We did not eat at ART, but would like to next time. The hotel location could not have been better.",
            "I stayed here in a corner Elliott Bsy Suite with my husband and my son. The hotel room was very nicely appointed, but I was not crazy about the color scheme, if I can be picky. The room was very comfortable and well-appointed, and very clean. One thing that I did not understand was why they didn't put any heating vents in the bathroom. It was a very chilly day in Seattle, and the bathroom was always very cold. Heated floors would have been a nice touch. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel.",
            "I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada which is across the boarder from Seattle however I had to stay overnight for business meetings. I would highly recommend the Four Seasons Hotel. In one word this hotel is perfection. Literally there is nothing wrong with this hotel. I am very picky about the level of service I receive in hotel and there is not one think I could complain about this hotel is the BEST hotel I have ever stayed at.",
            "We just returned from a 3 night stay over Labor Day weekend & loved this hotel. I paid for a sedan pick up throught the hotel which made it all less stressful upon arrival. One we arrived the staff was outstanding and our partial bay view room clean, bright and very comfortable. One thing to note though is if you look at the hotel images of the sound/bay view, it will look like an unobstructed. The reality is that you will see smoke stacks and a storage facility in front of the hotel, looking towards Puget Sound, plus a very busy elevated highway when looking out. Which is a shame but Seattle is a bustling big city and these things are there. The one thing I really loved about our room was the deep soaking tub. If you like taking baths versus showers, you will love it!! The other best feature about the location of the hotel is that there is an entrance to the Fish/Farmers market directly accross the street, so if it rains and the marketplace is open (9-5:30?) you can walk through it without ever getting wet. We ordered an in room breakfast our first morning and paid $88.00. Walk into the marketplace & get yourself some awesome coffee, dounuts, freshly made crepes and paying far less is my suggestion. But my ricotta pancakes and lemon curd were quite delicous!! Enjoy your stay...we certainly did and should have at $1280.00 for 3 nights!",
            "Stayed at the wonderful four seasons for 3 nights for work and sightseeing. I've stayed at many different four seasons properties across the globe and this one is better than the average four seasons. The service is great. The front desk and lobby staff are super friendly and go out of their way to helpful. They made great restaurant recommendations (metropolitan grill was my fav) and assisted us in storing/refrigerating some food we purchased at nearby Pike market. The location is great - very close to the famous pike market and acquarium (great for kids). Seattle is a terrific walking city with lots of shopping choices and we found the four seasons to be a great home base to see everything. The room was very high quality and modern. Love the in mirror tv. Always appreciate the turn down service with complimentsry bottles of water. The housekeeping staff was invisible yet they always cleaned our room whenever we left the room, which is the way it should be. Had a nice view of the water from our room. Very nice room overall. The fitness center has pretty new equipment but not much choice. Nice views of the water from the treadmill. Pool was closed, outside only and pretty small. The spa was pleasant, and massage was good like most other four seasons spas. The locker room was a bit disappointing - small with a steam room but no sauna or whirlpool. Wifi Internet worked well but was expensive. Tv choices were great - even had nfl network. Had breakfast one morning and it was uneventful as the food was very average - you're better off walking to a nearby diner. Overall I would definitely recommend the four seasons Seattle to anyone traveling to Seattle for work or fun.",
            "Everything was perfect. When we checked in the girl at the front dest caught the names of the kids and called them by name the entire time we were there. The kids got special treats which made them happy! The hotel is close to everything so you don't need a car to get around.",
            "From Start to Finish, our stay was fantastic. Every single staff member worked with a singular purpose - Provide First Class Hospitality...and they do! The rooms were spotless, and the restaurant food was delicious, beautiful and priced lower than I expected. The bar fills with locals during M-Th Happy Hour, but clears out by 8:00 leaving plenty of room for hotel guests. The infinity pool is a great way to spend an afternoon, and the staff was very attentive. The cool towels they offered were a nice treat to help beat the heat. (We happen to be there for 85 degree weather...) We will be coming back soon!",
            "We stayed here for three nights before our Alaskan cruise. The room was large and clean and very quiet. Recommend the bay view, was outstanding! The location is excellent, can walk just about anywhere, markets, piers, shopping. The staff was excellent and attentive but not overbearing. The infiniti pool with fireplace wasbeautiful place to relax. This hotel had a lot of little complimentary touches that added to the overall stay. The restaurant was excellent for food and service! Our only negatives were two: our bed size, had to book room with two doubles and when you are used to a King, it's very small, might book the King with two rollaways next time but beds were very comfortable. Second, the internet fee was per device! We all had iPads so it added up quick! Overall, stay was wonderful and can't wait to return!",
            "My wife and I were visiting Seattle and had the pleasure of staying at this incredible hotel.. The lobby was magnificent.. candles everywhere and an incredible fireplace with architecture to match! The staff were all friendly and helpful.. We stayed on the fourth floor.. not usually where we like to stay at any hotel , however the room was beautiful with all the amenities we could ever want. We loved the TV in the bathroom mirror and the shower was awesome with the dual showerheads (although the pressure was lacking)... Our room was right across from the spa, gym and pool... which was great as they always had fresh lemon water there even though it was a little too cool and rainy to use the small pool. One of the two negatives were the tiny bathroom shade, which left a half-inch on both sides, thus possibly exposing us to outside onlookers. The other issue was a major problem -- the air conditioning shut down and we had to have maintenance come at 6:30 in the morning and vacuum the water in the internal drip pan making a whole LOT of noise and totally knocking our experience down a few steps and why I gave the room only 4 stars... The hotel is only a block and a half from the famous Pike Place market and we took EVERY chance to go there and had an great time!! For anyone looking for an incredible Seattle experience, the Pike Place market is the place to go!! We loved that the hotel was so close!",
            "We have stayed in numerous hotels in downtown Seattle and have always appreciated being able to walk to nearby attractions. The Four Seasons is adjacent to Pike Place Market and it was a pleasure to sneak over for an early morning stroll through the Market prior to our conference. All aspects of our visit to the hotel were stellar. Great service, amenities and guestrooms. We would highly recommend staying here and think it is one of the highlights of our worldly travels. It is definitely would be a place to receive",
            "The Four Seasons in Seattle is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location, but what sets it apart from other hotels is the magnificent staff. The front desk is very accommodating. The concierge arranged wonderful in room massages for us and provided excellent directions to our destinations. The wait staff at the Art restaurant even helped us plan our itinerary each day and gave us valuable insights as to great spots to visit that weren't as touristy such as the Fremont Market. Everyone is extremely nice and helpful. The hotel lobby is lovely and the rooms are serene. The bathroom is huge. We had a room on a high floor facing the city and it was very quiet. The beds are comfortable. The breakfasts are wonderful. I was very impressed and would return for future visits.",
            "This is everything you expect at Four Seasons, beautiful great service and high quality. For valet parking I like that they have their own garage below the hotel rather than off site. Had a lower leve 4th floor room facing street and was happy to find hotel so well built I did not notice the street noise. The water view side does have a view of the sound but I mostly noticed the industrial buildings between the hotel and sound, perhaps better view at higher level. I am in Seattle often but only my second time here as the prices swing dramatically in this market. I tend to shop this against Hotel 1000, not quite as upscale as Four Seasons but a good barometer. When priced in mid $200's best hotel in Seattle, even if they hit you for $11 wireless.",
            "We just arrived back from a wonderful trip to Seattle at the Four Seasons, it is a beautiful hotel with a perfect location as we walked everywhere. The weather was in the 70s, no humidity and sunny everyday. We went for a romantic getaway, one night we took a cab to Canlis which I highly recommend for a special occasion dinner, it was exquisite. The staff at the Four Seasons is very warm and it has a very modern lobby, a beautiful fire place and they make you feel special as a guest and welcome you back. The bedding was lovely and the bathroom was amazing, they had a built in plasma in the bathroom mirror which was a really fun way to watch the news in the morning with a lovely soaking tub. We had a partial water view and I agree the views are a bit industrial, but besides that minor comment we loved the hotel. We took advantage of their special offer for three nights and they were very accommodating to let us check in early and two hours late. When we checked in they gave us a coupon for $25 off the spa for each of us, so we used the spa, which is lovely and get a couples massage for no extra cost, although the view was very industrial from the massage room, but besides that we really enjoyed it. They offer a beautiful relaxation room with tea, snacks and water. We took a water plane to Victoria for a day trip and I would highly recommend that experience spectacular views and it is a beautiful city!",
            "My husband and I stayed here for part of our 30th Anniversary trip; it was the best part of our vacation. From the extremely knowledgeable and courteous concierge, the restaurants, room service, everything was an experience to remember. The room had a water view and the bed was like laying on the clouds. The hotel was located across the street from an entrance to Pike Place Market and within walking distance of the major shops. I wouldn't hesitate to go back again!",
            "This was my first stay at a Four Seasons when I was on a business trip. I had high expectations which were surpassed in every way. I was in a standard room which was huge. Amazingly comfortable beds, huge bathroom with a huge deep bath and a TV in the mirror, Customr service was exceptional in every way especially in the bar where the bar staff made exceptional cocktails. The Spa and Gym were top quality and well worth the money. Highly recommended if you can get to stay here.",
            "I have stayed at this hotel several times on business (I travel to Seattle 6-10 times per year) and have never been disappointed. The staff is phenom - always friendly and helpful. The beds are extremely comfortable. The rooms are spacious. (Did I mention there is a full stall shower, a soaking tub, AND a TV in the bathroom mirror?) The location is incredible. My only complaint about this place is that I have to leave... although I suppose I could move into one of their residential units. The little touches and personable service at this hotel cannot be beat in the Seattle area.",
            "The Four Seasons Seattle is brand spanking new and was the reason we chose to drive down from Vancouver for a few days over the holidays. The hotel is perfectly located right next to the Pike Place Market with views over the water. The rooms are typical Four Seasons city hotel decor everything is perfectly in place but to be honest a wee bit boring. Common areas are lovely and the bar is a nice place to sip a cocktail and was quite buzzing. Staff were nice and attentive but not quite as polished as other properties that have been around a bit longer, to be expected given they had just opened. Would not hesitate to book here again next time we are in Seattle. One minor criticism we would have would be with housekeeping. One of the reasons we love the Four Seasons is the invisible housekeeping we have experienced. At other properties we have marveled at how every time we left the room it was miraculously made up when we returned and we never ever see a maid. At this location it seemed that we were always bumping into the housekeeping staff and the timing of the room refresh was always off, evening turndown service always came when we were in the room and we had to settle for grabbing a couple a fresh towels and a bar of soap from the maid through the doorway.",
            "My husband and I stayed at this hotel two weeks ago. We were en route to British Columbia and decided to spend 2 nights in Seattle. We were booked at another privately owned boutique hotel close by which appeared to be nice on its website but when I realized the Four Seasons was only $25 more night, I immediately canceled that reservation and booked with the Four Seasons and was very glad I did. We arrived late around 11 PM but we were still on NY time and it was 2 AM for us. We were very tired and were thrilled at how comfy the beds were and loved the delicious pizza we ordered from room service. The rooms/bathrooms were lovely but much smaller than the Four Seasons in NYC (the one in NYC is about $200 more a night also, so I guess you get what you pay for). We LOVED the tv embedded into the bathroom mirror..very nice unexpected touch. We had breakfast at ART and the lemon ricotta pancakes were to die for ( i have also had these at the NYC location but they were even better here). If you are going to Seattle and thought this hotel would be out of your price range check it out anyway. We got a great rate would definitely stay here again. The location is perfect!",
            "Very comfortable. If anything they are too nice and accommodating--if that is possible. Views of Elliot Bay, wood accents, generously sized-rooms. I was impressed. According to some of the Seattlites in my group, the restaurant and lounge, called ART, has one of Seattle's best Happy Hours. Endless exotic cheese table, Tapas Unlimited, Mini-Burgers, Proscuitto di Parma board, and Calamari was good enough to skip dinner.",
            "Excellent service nice hotel decor. If traveling with children the hotel does a great job at recognizing them. Seattle has a few great hotels but none match the level of service that the Four Seasons offers. Location by Pikes Place Market is an added bonus. When booking your room check room size because they do vary. Lobby is limited so if planning any type of business conversation meet off site there is no place to talk in private.",
            "I have been to Seattle many times and have stayed at many fine hotels however The Four Seasons Seattle trumps them all. The service by all the employees from bell staff, bar, front desk, spa, concierge desk, housekeeping, all of them are perfect professionals who aims to please all their customers. It is always worth staying at a Four Seasons Hotel anywhere in the world as they are all about first class service and making the customer feel special. Great rooms with great views of Seattle, perfect location very close to Pike's Market and shopping. Close to the convention centre for those of you staying here on business which was in my case for this trip. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience a stressfree, first class experience. Check out my profile on tripadvisor of the places I have stayed to realize that I know what I am talking about when it comes to first class hotels and restaurants.",
            "Hotel looked impressive. Swimming pool was incredibe. Room very nice... except: only one chair to sit in... very hard to have breakfast with partner (don't like eating in bed). Wireless connect wasn't working right. We had corner room and curtains would not operate correctly. Had to stand on chair and yank curtains closed. 24 hour fast ironing service (advertized heavily) was not available... turned shirts/pants in at 8pm and were not delivered back until 8am. Ordered room service for breakfast... it was late by 20 minutes. Good thing our meeting wasn't til 9! For the price of $500 + I would stay at Hotel 1000 any day.",
            "My husband and I stayed overnight on a quick trip up from Vancouver. The hotel is in a great location, only a couple of minutes walk to the Farmer's Market. We found the staff to be very friendly and efficient, especially the concierge, a lovely lass called Meaghan. As we were new to the city, she was able to suggest several places to visit and also which public transport to take. Our room was excellent with a lovely view onto the pool area. I was delighted to see they had a firepit for guests to sit by in the morning after a swim while waiting for the sun to appear. We enjoyed cocktails in the lounge but didn't get to try the restaurant, although the menu was impressive, as we were going elsewhere for dinner. We would definitely recommend the Four Seasons. Also look out for the yummy chocolate shop adjacent to the foyer",
            "We stayed here in late December. The room was immaculate and bed was amazing. The windows span the length of the floor which is nice and it offers a great view, we had windows that spanned the length (horizontal) of our room facing the mountains and sea. The bath was nice, separate toilet and bath as well as shower, lots of glass and TV in the mirror. Everyone at the hotel was great, no complaints there. The hotel is also a short walk from Pike's Place as well as some of the more notable attractions the city has to offer. There's also a staircase right next to the hotel that takes you right down to the docks. Across the street is the Seattle Art museum. Overall the hotel was perfect, clean, new, and a great place to sleep. Would come here again.",
            "We reserved & checked into a beautiful harbor view room. It was very well planned... lots of storage, the chaise positioned perfectly for enjoying the view, and a spacious bathroom. Due to a small problem with the door, we were upgraded to a 1 room suite. It was amazing... an even better view, HUGE amount of space, beautiful fireplace, extra half bathroom and dining room. Very friendly and helpful staff, always greeting us whenever we saw them. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that the Pike Street Market was so close, and that we could access it through a small mall across the street from the hotel.",
            "The location is great, the market is literally around the corner and it is close to the waterfront. Waterfront views are fantastic, and so is the pool area. The gym facility is not staffed like some other Four Seasons I have stayed at. Don't pay the ridiculous amount for breakfast at the hotel, walk to the market where you can get all kinds of choices at reasonable prices. Valet service was prompt. Had access to hotel car as well, which was very convenient. As other reviews have stated, the pool area is fantastic. Overall great place to stay.",
            "Our stay at the four seasons seattle was our first time staying here and we were not disappointed. The location was very central for shopping, visiting the waterfront and pikes place market. The hotel staff was all fantastic, we had great service at the concierge, front desk, lounge, bell desk, and restaurant. The staff was great at remembering us and greeting us warmly. The rooms were well designed and spacious, but very simple. Bathroom was large with a wonderful shower and bath area. Anything this hotel lacks they make up with the incredible staff. We did not encounter one rude staff member while we were there. Definitely would stay here again.",
            "From the moment we walked in, this hotel (and its staff) blew us away. Each member of the staff greeted us by name -- including knowing our different last names and our daughter's first name. They kept track of where we went and asked my daughter if she enjoyed it. The recommendations provided for dining and activities were top shelf. The rooms are beautiful and definitely worth mentioning, but the true standout at this property is the staff. We have stayed in numerous Four Seasons properties throughout the world (including Paris) and this is hands down the top hotel for Service. This was our third vacation in Seattle and we will never stay anywhere else.",
            "We just spent 5 nights at this hotel. The entire experience was beyond excellent! The best staff of any hotel we've stayed in. Rooms were very nice, comfortable and well appointed. And nice roomy bathroom! Can't wait to go back soon!",
            "I spent three pleasant evenings at the Four Seasons Seattle in May, 2009. I would recommend the hotel to other travelers. The hotel is a new structure, of modest height, right on Seattle\u2019s waterfront. A few of the rooms have direct waterfront views. Many other rooms (mine included) overlook the pool area and have diagonal views of the water. There are also rooms which look out over the streets that surround the hotel (I thiink I'd try to avoid those). The interior d\u00e9cor is modern (think bleached wood, and Scandinavian design). The standard rooms are of decent size, and include a built in desk with two chairs (one a high tech swivel chair with mesh back and seat) and one easy chair. The easy chair suffers (just a little) from the modern design problem \u2013 i.e., it\u2019s beautiful to look at but nowhere near as comfortable as a traditional overstuffed arm chair. The room was perfectly quiet during my stay (no noise from adjoining rooms, nor any detectable noise from the outside). The lighting in the room is good \u2013 each of the reading locations has a light source of more than ample wattage. All of the linens and bedding were of the normal high Four Seasons quality. The service was excellent. All my interactions with the front desk were handled precisely and efficiently. The concierge offered a dinner recommendation, and followed up with an inquiry about the meal. The one breakfast I ate in the restaurant was very good. This hotel lacks some of the charm and history that the Olympic Hotel provided when it was managed by Four Seasons. That said, this is a very fine hotel, and one I would be glad to visit again.",
            "My husband and I had an unexpected 24 hour layover in Seattle on our way to Cambodia. As my husband had never been to Seattle, we picked the Four Seasons for its proxemity to the waterfront and Pike's Market. The rooms were beautiful. We enjoyed the large soaking tub, the ability to watch the news in the mirror while getting dressed in the morning, and the view of the water. Just like all Four Seasons stays, this one was fantastic. The only negative could happen anywhere...I left my jewelry pouch on the made bed. It had several irreplaceable items int it. I called within 45 minutes of checking out but they didn't have any of their staff members report it.",
            "This is not a usually grandiose Four Seasons Hotel. The building outside appearance was not very attractive and at night the area was very dark. But inside the hotel, it was Four Seasons quality as usual: New modern comfortable spacious room (but the decor & furniture were not cozy) and great service. I was really impressed with their \"fibre\" high speed internet connection; it's even better than at home! Overall it's a very nice hotel.",
            "What can I say, if you've done any Four Seasons its a very plush known quantity. We always deal directly with any hotel/resort we are staying at, rather than book online, even with their own website. There is always added value going this route, whether it be a personal touch, like the child sized Four Season bathrobes and cute stuffed animal gifts laid out for the children, or even an upgrade bc you make the reservation agent laugh. Front desk service was inviting, very \"proper\", and yet not stuffy. We stayed here for the weekend after a week long rental on Whidbey Island. We could see the city for a couple of days, and ya know, stay at the Four Seasons...weekends are always cheaper. The rooms are beautifully well appointed, beds uber comfy and sheets with fairy tale softness. The bathrooms are downright interior designer porn. Nice big flatscreen, wifi (I think I paid), and groovy infinity pool and hot tub with a view. We ordered in the first night, and though the food was beautiful and delicious. However, it looked better than it tasted and for the amount we spent could have eaten at a high end restaurant. Wonder if the in house restaurant would have had a little better food, but with the kid's with us, it was the best food we were going to get. THey did have a children's menu. Anyway, after looking at the various Kimpton properties, and W, on the Trip Advisor reviews, I decided that Four Seasons was a no brainer. And we were well rewarded for staying here.",
            "Unbelieavably wonderful service. The kind where you think if care so genuinely about your stay or if they are just paid to do so. I believe they really care or they are good actors. You can stay one night but everyone including the doorman knows your name and greets you. Awesome view, awesome location right next to the museum and pike place market. I won't go into the amenities and how nice the rooms are but rest assured it's the four seasons and there are no better rooms I have stayed in even compared to st Regis and ruts carltons of the world. To top it off, their rates are very low compared to four seasons in other cities. I highly recommend it as the stay is well worth the money!",
            "Amazing service from the second you drive up. Always opening doors, calling you by name, offered me an upgraded room, fast room service, excellent food at the restaurant, beautiful views from the room, great pool area (with firepit) and great gym. really excellent brand new hotel. right down in the heart of seattle - near pike's place - minutes to belltown, minutes to the freeway to redmond, etc.",
            "This is a stellar hotel sitting right on the edge of the sound. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with excellent appointments. All just what you'd expect from a Four Seasons. The service is equally charming and attentive. This the kind of hotel that makes travelling the perfect mix of adventure and creature comforts.",
            "I lucked out with a conference rate and was quite pleased, worth the extra walk to get to the convention center. The hotel is fairly new and definitely up to 4 seasons standards, similar to the one in Denver in decor. The room was quite large with a separate bedroom separated from a large bathroom by a small hallway-- I had a city view room but could see the harbor in a reflection on the building across the street. As is typical of 4 seasons, the staff really made the experience with everyone being very helpful and friendly, including providing a town car for trips around town when it was available. The hotel is 1 block from the Pike Place Market, 7 blocks from the convention center, and 3 blocks from the Westlake station that will take you to the Space Needle.",
            "In my multiple yearly trips to Seattle over the past 15 years I always looked forward to the FS Olympic. I was bummed when it left the FS family. Great things are worth waiting for. The FS Seattle is so much better. The location at Union and 1st is perfect and close to the wharf and freeways and shopping. The staff is top notch. We had a 700am meeting across town and the restaurant staff and midnight shift room service worked together to serve us breakfast in the restaurant. The rooms have fabulous water views. The rooms are modern yet very uncomfortable and bathrooms are the spectacular (if you like bathrooms) The FS experience has retuned to Seattle better than ever and this is the best for business, family, or a city get away, You will not be dissapointed at the Four Seasons Seattle",
            "I spent one night at the Four Seasons on a business trip. We arrived before check in time. My friend's room was ready, mine was not. We decided to have lunch. It was quite a nice lunch, although the view of the Public Storage facility is not the best. During the lunch my key arrived and our bags were taken to the rooms and correctly put in each room. I had a very good room service breakfast, right on time. This has all the usual feel of a Four Serasons, including excellent service. I would happily stay there again. I had a view of the water, which is very interesting and I would recommend it. It can be so nice to just relax into a Four Seasons and know things will be done right!",
            "just completed a 4 night stay in a deluxe elliott bay suite...luxury unsurpassed, staff amazingly friendly & helpful. pool area, albeit small, decadent in its service. room service quick & efficient-person who answered the phone noticed i had a cold, sent up a complimentary cup of tea w/honey! concierge, eric loan in particular, assisted in helping us plan our trip in advance, reservations, taxis, etc...all handled w/the utmost of professionalism.",
            "The location of The Four Seasons is perfect to Pike's market. I don't think we could have gotten any closer. We actually stayed at this hotel to be close to the market. The room was beautiful and spacious. We had Mother's Day Brunch at their restraunt and it was amazing, absolutely amazing. The food presentation was beautiful and everything tasted perfect. The food service was great also. Great shopping is within walking distance, along with many restraunts. The only thing I would say that was slightly negative about this hotel, is they are not very friendly when you're looking for advice or information. They seemed to be bothered by to many questions and never engaged in offering suggestions easily. We visited Pike's market every day we were there and the market was filled with happy energy and good foods.",
            "Great hotel that is right next to Pike street market. Rooms are very comfortable. The pool/jacuzzi setting is great considering you are in a busy downtown area. Be advised that the rooms don't photograph well, the pictures posted by travelers are not that great because of the room color/decor are somewhat plain, the rooms look much better in real life than the pictures show.",
            "Just returned from 3 night stay in Seattle for work. Four Seasons was fantastic. The rooms and location (50 yards from Pike Place) were great, and the service even better. I left home in a hurry and forgot shaver, deodorant and cufflinks. The hotel had the first two up to my room in around 2 minutes, and for the cufflinks they were able to get a contact at Brooks Brothers to open the store for them at 7:30am, and they brought back a pair of exactly what I asked for, well in advance of when I needed to leave for work that morning. I will definitely be back and will try to bring the family on vacation there as well. I highly recommend it.",
            "Without realizing it we arrived at the hotel when Manchester United was staying there. After I had to be told who they were(we aren't soccer fans! )we proceeded to have a fabulous stay despite the total chaos that MU presence brought to the hotel. With hundreds of fans outside the hotel, kept behind police tape, my family and I were able to come and go without any hassle. Not even so much as being asked to show proof we were guests in order to re-enter the hotel. It's that Four Seasons magic-they had a security system in place that protected those that needed it but didn't hassle other hotel guests. The hotel rooms are beautiful. Our party had 2-one waterfront corner 1 bedroom suite and one waterfront deluxe room. The deluxe room was so spacious that I had to make sure it wasn't the suite before the kids settled into it! Location fabulous. Right across the street from the art museum, right at Pike's Market. Very close to lots of what's happening in Seattle. If you have the time arrange a tour of the city on your first day, DO IT!! The concierge set up small group van tour which was 3 hours and very interesting. Even went out to the locks and saw the boats coming through them. Also saw the \"steps\" at the locks. The fish ladder built to facilitate fish returning upstream to spawn. We spent about 1/2 hour at the locks. It was a nice break from sitting in a tour van and this part of the tour really catches the children's attention. If you're a fish lover than Seattle is the right town for you. We had some of the freshest, most creatively prepared fish on this trip. Don't miss the opportunity when in Seattle to enjoy the fish-and of course the coffee!! A coffee shop on every corner! My coffee addicted husband thought he'd died and gone to heaven! Hard not to have fun in this town and can't wait to go back again.",
            "My husband and I enjoyed the best service of any hotel in Seattle. No one would be disappointed with the ambiance, service, and amenities here. In addition, it is a mere step away from the places all visitors want to be. The location could not be better.",
            "Just spent a weekend at the Four Seasons in Seattle. The room was wonderful and we were looked after expertly by everyone at the hotel. Great location too. We enjoyed the gym and spa facilities - the steam room was amazing. Everything at the hotel was well thought out. Highly recommend to anyone thinking of visiting.",
            "I had a very good one night stay here at a hotel that truely fits in the luxury category. (Bill Gates supposedly owns one of the condos above) My room service was interesting and tasty. Everything in the room worked well and was comfortable and I really enjoyed the outdoor hot tub. Of course every little thing is very expensive but that's what you expect at a place like this. The view from the hot tub was great. My room cost $50 more for having a \"partial view\" of the sound which I took only because it was the last room available in Seattle that night. Please... Don't be silly, there was no view without getting a neck ache. This property offers everything I could think of wanting in a downtown Seattle luxury hotel. Oh yeah, the location is awesome with a great view and right by the Pike Place market and walking distance to everything downtown.",
            "It was my pleasure to stay at the Seattle Four Season's for a stay-cation with my husband. I was impressed with their offering the hotel's personal car service when I inquired about a taxi and loved the room on the pool level facing Puget Sound. We were also thrilled with the service from our server and food for breakfast at the restaurant as well.",
            "The first plus is the ease of finding the hotel. When travelling from north of the city Exit 165B and travel on Union Street until the street ends. We were greeted by a thoughtful staff and eventhough an entire European soccer club was staying at the hotel and mobs of fans littered the area around the hotel we were made to feel welcomed. We were never were bothered by the fans and the hotel was really quiet even while at full occupancy. The hotel has a modern design (no this is not the Olympia) with a fireplace going non-stop in the lobby, lovely marble bathrooms and the use of light coloured wood in rooms. I enjoyed the artwork in the rooms and public areas. The food was great. We ate breakfast in the dining room every morning and we were not disappointed. We ordered room service too and enjoyed our snacks. The pool area has been well thought out. The pool is small but freshing after a full day of shopping (The Nordstorm rack is only 2 blocks away). The unique fire pit beside the hot tub is a fun addition to the pool area but be careful in the wind (don't burn your feet)! The location of this hotel is great. It is directly across from the Seattle Art Museum. The Pike Place market is only one block away! On a nice day you can even walk to the Space Needle from the hotel. It's about 12 blocks away. I would go back in a mintue if only to use the spa area. If you are going stay in Seattle why wouldn't you stay here?",
            "I got in late on a Monday and was quickly helped by the bell man and checked in by the concierge, I went upstairs to the largest City hotel room I've ever stayed in. Everything seemed super-sized from New York or DC. The bathtub in the bathroom was large and inviting, the walk in rain shower so large! I also didn't realize how close Pike Place Market was, it was literally like a 3 minute walk up the street, so the downtown location can't be beat. The inside of the hotel was spotless, the only thing that left to be desired was the view, I had a city-view, I'm imaging the lake view was much nicer but also much more expensive. I didn't go into the pool but the pool area had a great view, there were lots of chairs and a fire in case it was cold. The only strange thing about the hotel was that one of the things it faces is a giant public storage building. We had an event and the food was fantastic, the service there was also great, everyone was just so helpful and friendly, I can't wait to go back. My one complaint was that we didn't get to stay longer.",
            "I stayed in Seattle for two nights, and this property it really is worth every penny, rooms are magnificent, very large and equipped with all modern technologies, good leisure facilities with Fitness center, Spa and outdoor pool. The location is amazing: just a block away from the Pike Market. great place to stay and discover Seattle",
            "This is unlike most Four Seasons: a smaller, boutique style with a \" Scandinavia meets Zen\" interior design. The lobby is rather dark, lit by a fire and little candles/ nightlights even in the middle of the day, which I found a bit disconcerting. Overall, I found the design effects rather bland and not very comfortable. Upstairs, the corridors are narrow and featureless - imagine a 3 star airport hotel. However service IS true FS standard and very efficient. We had drinks and snacks one evening in the ART bar, which was positively buzzing (it WAS Happy Hour) with a most convivial atmosphere. Dinner in the ART restaurant the following evening in the restaurant was more indifferent. The bedroom was fine, usual excellent bedding and linens and the bathroom lovely and spacious with a great rainhead shower; yes, the TV in the bathroom mirror is a gimmick, but we found it entertaining (never seen THAT before)! As tourists who had never previously visited Seattle, we thought the location is very good (so close to Pike Place and easy walk downtown) and I would recommend the hotel as it is a high standard. However this isn't one of the \"raves\", but probably the best Seattle has to offer?",
            "Beautiful hotel with great amenities. The room was very spacious and everything was very clean. I do wish that they would have coffee/tea available throughout the morning, was only able to get it one morning. The location was great, right across from Pike's Place Market.",
            "Warm, personable, intelligent and competent staff from the doorman to the concierge to the management. The hotel lives the philosophy of its founder, Isadore Sharp. The restaurant food and service was so good, it was almost a disappoint when we ate anywhere else in Seattle.",
            "We stayed here after returning from Orcas Island for our last day and night of vacation. We were upgraded and the room was fabulous. Service was out of this world. Stop into Fran's chocolate shop for an extra special sweet. The infinity pool is beautiful and oh so serene. Fitness center is well equipped and has a great view. Staff arrived several minutes into my workout and brought water to me on the treadmill... with a lid and straw, which just happened to fit perfectly into the cup holder... Now that's service!",
            "Property is in great location, halfway between the piers, sightseeing and shopping districts (key since it is a hilly city). Superb service and beautifully maintained property. Nice restaurant/bar, and welcoming lobby. The tv in the bathroom mirror is a cool gadget and convenient amenity. The best activity in the hotel: watch the sunset while enjoying a bottle of nice Washington Cabernet or Syrah and marveling at the Puget Sound view by the fire pit in the pool/jacuzzi area! Standard Superior Room and City-View Room are ok. Do not get a Partial Bay View Room as the part of the view that is not the bay is a less than desirable view (unappealing residential building with residents looking your way). And to look at the bay you need to strain your neck next to the window. Best choice is a Deluxe Bay-View Room or, if willing to splurge, any of the suites.",
            "I stayed here in November and it was my first trip to Seattle. I wanted to near the tourist spots and didn't want to rent a car. Well, it was a long day of walking, but I think I managed to see everything on the beaten path. We had brunch both days at Art and one lunch. The food was delicious. The hotel feels very new and modern. Nice bar scene and fireplace.",
            "Our room was beautiful, the staff was very helpful and any and all requests were cheerfully honored. We were treated to the excellence of service that one expects at a fine hotel. Every detail, every convenience at your finger tips. The location is in the heart of Pike Place Market. Within walking distance of many fine restaurants and right across the street from the SAM -- art museum. The pool was just what we needed to cool off on a hot day (100 degrees) while watching the sunset in the bay. Staff couldn't have been more helpful with dinner reservations, recommendations, etc...Prior to our stay at the Four Seasons, we had been at another hotel (Pan Pacific) and experienced such poor service fromt the staff that we moved out and up, so to speak! Well worth the move. Would go back in a heartbeat!",
            "This four season's hotel fully delivers. In addition to amazing rooms and service, we took advantage of their spa, which is probably the best in town. The facilities are perfect, the service is outstanding and the amenities are phenomenal. The food and service at Art restaurant was without fault. I highly recommend this facility.",
            "But you will pay $$$$ for the amenities that come with it. :) That's to be expected though as it's one of the nicest hotels in the city. The neighborhood, while close to tourist attractions, can be a bit dodgy at night. It's right by the water though and has really pretty views during the day. The rooms are immaculate, with lots of closet space and square footage. The bathrooms are to die for and great for couples. Probably my favorite thing about the hotel. Marble floors and tub, TV inside the mirror and rainforest shower heads. Amazing. The fitness room while small comes with nice amenities like ice-cold towels and lemon infused water. There's also an infinity pool outside if you prefer to do laps in the morning instead.",
            "the location is fabulous. just steps away from downtown and pike market. only a few minutes walk to pioneer square. the rooms are very cold and minimalist--it's way to cool to have curves and warmth. for a hotel group with the reputation of the four seasons the service level is not what i expected. i had to pry room cleaning out of the housekeeping deparrment(they said they clean rooms between 9 and 5:30). the last thing one wants after being out of a hotel room ALL DAY with the only wish to have a quick nap is to find a room that hasn't been cleaned (and it is late afternoon). perhaps with the economic downturn they have had to decrease staff and service. perhaps service depends on room level; i felt like my room didn't rate. i usually stay at the inn at market. i regret not staying there this trip.",
            "We went to the Four Season with the kids for a little Staycation in Seattle and it was wonderful. The location is fantastic, just steps away from Pike Place and the Piers. The pool was a hit with the kids, as was the brownie sundae by the pool!! Amazing place.",
            "I stayed for three nights on business. Got a corner room with two double beds. Good views on both sides. Good sized room. Fantastic bathroom. Quality fixtures. Quite air conditioning. Wonderful professional service. Nice business center where I printed my boarding pass. The hotel is within walking distance to mostly everything, or within inexpensive cab ride distance. (Seattle downtown is a really nice walking downtown so I would walk instead of catching a cab whenever possible.) Would definitely stay here again. At the end of the conference, I also got a massage at the Spa. I was settled into a room overlooking the Elliot Bay. All the facilities are top-notched. The bed was heated, the pillow was adjusted, and the room was sizable. My massage therapist was Lauren. I just have to say, her techniques are superb. She worked my kinks in silence and hit all the right spots. Would definitely come here again.",
            "Great service, location (very close to Pike Market) & the beds are always like sleeping on a cloud. I guess that's what you would expect while staying at the Four Seasons right? We have also have a 3 yr old & they were extremely accomodating with him as well.",
            "The strip joint located next door has closed. The hotel artwork is worth a re-visit. Located directly accross the street from the Seattle Art Museum. Stunning view's of the water and museum. The best and biggest tub's in town and a huge shower.",
            "My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons for three nights during our wedding weekend. We had a nice, large room with an excellent view of the water (over the viaduct and some buildings, as others have noted). The bed was nicely positioned so you could lay in bed while enjoying the views. The bathroom was great with a large soaking tub as well as a separate double headed shower. We ordered room service for breakfast all three mornings and all of the food was fabulous. (Though the coffee was a bit disappointing, as we live in Seattle and know much better coffee is to be found nearby.) We also had dinner in the restaurant, ART, one night, which was also very good. The view isn't quite as good at the restaurant because its on the first floor, but it still had a great ambiance and our food exceeded our expectations for a hotel restaurant. The day after our wedding we had absolutely heavenly massages at the spa. The massage tables are the most comfortable I've ever been on. As a honeymoon treat, they offered us complimentary chocolate covered strawberries in the relaxation room after our treatment, which added to our wonderful experience. After our massages we went out to the pool deck for a cocktail and a light lunch. The pool area is very nice, though it was overcrowded with families given that it was a nice Sunday afternoon. We got the only two loungers available, though I should note an employee helped us find them and set them up for us. All in all it was very relaxing to lounge by the pool, even with all of the kids splashing around in the pool. We were very happy we chose the Four Seasons for our wedding weekend stay - our pre-honeymoon. The staff is fabulous, the beds are heavenly, and I honestly had absolutely no complaints.",
            "First and foremost, it is important to recognize that this hotel, we learned, is a recent rebirth of the former Four Seasons Hotel which is now the Fairmont. A newly constructed building, the new Four Seasons in Seattle is a wonderful hotel in almost all respects. Location, design, staff, service, and ambiance are all Four Season level of quality. The restaurant ART and room service are impeccable and the rooms are first rate. In particular, the rooms are clean and roomy and the bedding is very comfortable, as one would expect from a hotel in the Four Seasons stable. One small criticism, probably not relevant to all guests, is the significant traffic noise that accompanies rooms that are not \"bay view.\" Finally, a word of caution to those who wish to avail themselves of cab service in the Seattle downtown area: we used cab service ten times during our almost week-long stay and found the drivers to be universally arrogant, angry, unappreciative of their clients, unethical, and just generally very unpleasant, among the most unpleasant, rude and incompetent cabbies we have ever experienced. We have been all over the free world over the last 40 years and were astonished at the lack of interest these 10 drivers exhibited in providing even a modicum of decent service. When we discussed this with the hotel staff, they reported that cab service in Seattle was among the most complained about subjects they hear about on a daily basis. Very sad indeed! It marred an otherwise very fine stay in Seattle.",
            "Great location in downtown. The staff is over the top helpful with any requests or questions. The room was spotless, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The Puget Sound views were breathtaking. The room service was always on time and ready with the morning newspaper and a big warm smile. The hotel made a few dinner reservations for us and we always got an excellent table with great wait staff. Even the front door staff is terrific; always willing to gladly open any doors for you and to get or arrange for transportation. Stay away from the hotel bar area during sunset, it gets very warm and bright and the bar maids can become a little less helpful when asked to lower the shades.",
            "My wife and I stayed two nights at the Four Seasons on our way to a two week vacation in Hawaii. We wanted to break up the long trip from Detroit to Honolulu by laying over in Seattle. The Four Seasons is in a great location downtown, near the waterfront. Every aspect of our stay was superb and it was a great start to an awesome vacation!",
            "This was my first opportunity to stay at a Four Seasons property and they definitely exceeded my expectation in every way possible. From the check-in, to bed turn down, to the food and drink in the bar and restaurant, I could not have asked for more. The Four Seasons over delivered in service each and every time I needed something, and even when I wasn't expecting it (like placing slippers next to the bed after turn down service). I will definitely be staying at this location in the future. Thank you!",
            "What a great hotel, almost made us want to move to Seattle, even put up with the long rainy season. Word of caution: the pictures posted by other people don't do the hotel justice. We almost didn't stay there because of the photos. Don't worry, the rooms are much better than they photograph. We love the 4 Seasons and we try to stay at these hotels as much as possible. This was such a pleasant stay. The Hotel is very warm despite the Modern decor. Location could not be any better. You are 1 block from Pike Market and easy to walk to many places. The Linens (if you are into high thread count and quality) were the best of any hotel we've stayed at. The windows are not as sound proof as they should be, but the noise didn't keep us up at night. Apparently Seattle is pretty tame at night. The pool setting is Magical, especially if you have kids. it isn't very big but will do. Also the pool is located in an inner courtyard (sort of) so it is protected from the wind.",
            "LOCATION- Took the Light Rail from the airport. $2.50 per person and 40 minutes to University station. Just a block from the hotel. Walked to the Pike Market every morning. LIght stroll to the pacific center- 10 minute walk. Aquarium is only 10 minute walk. The ferry to cross to Bainbridge is 20 minute walk. Everything was within 3 mile radius so that you have an option of using the complimentary house car. HOTEL - Probably the smallest Four Seasons in the US. Lobby is modern and clean but generally small. Pool and jacuzzi area also small, but beatiful view. SERVICE - As usual, FS quality. Haley at the concierge was very helpful. ART RESTAURANT- The doughnut desert was not as good as other people's review. Portions were small but still satisfying. KIDS 5 and under eat free.",
            "A beautiful hotel with wonderful staff and many personalized and added touches to our stay! Our family of 4 was treated like royalty. Both of our daughters felt special and recognized. The personalized touches to our room for our daughters 13th birthday were special and most importantly you didn't leave our the 10 year old she felt equally as wonderful. The beds were fabulous our youngest even pulled up the sheets to figure out what kind of bed she slept on. The rain shower, tv in the mirror, and huge spa tub were enjoyed by all. Most importantly the customer service was fabulous!",
            "We considered staying at a variety of hotels and almost stayed at Hotel 1000 - we're SO glad we chose the Four Seasons!!! The hotel is the ultimate in luxury and service and the location is unbeatable! We were staying there with a little baby and they made sure we were as comfortable as possible. They upgraded us to a suite to give us more room with the baby, provided a crib with blanket and toys and had all bath amenities/wipes/diaper pail for us. The rooms were understated but luxurious and comfortable and our views were fantastic of the bay. They have a great fitness center and pool and even provide diapers for little ones going in the pool. Every detail is covered.....we ate at ART for breakfast and dinner and the food was very good. It is a bit of a business scene for breakfast but nice nonetheless. The concierge was incredibly helpful and assisted in almost every aspect of our stay. We would highly recommend this Four Seasons and look forward to staying there again!",
            "Was here with family in two rooms overlooking Puget Sound - beautiful view (dont look down though as in front of the hotel is a grungy old building, but whatever...deal with it). The service was excellent - the concierge was great - getting us great tickets for a Mariners game, although that is not the hottest ticket in baseball). The concierge also hunted down a pair of swim goggles way after the pool staff had left. Went well beyond the call of duty and made one child very happy. The restaurant was fantastic for lunch - our kids had a great meal too and they did something so special for them (I wont mention, since I am not sure they want to repeat it over and over...) but the restaurant manager was a perfect gentleman, the waitress was so nice. Room service was always perfect too - no reason to leave for dinner (although it is very expensive and I am not a fan of built in service charges - let me be decide that). The salmon with Indian spices was excellent - the chowder is a meal itself. So overall - cost was high, but if that is not the issue and you want a perfect hotel located right in the action, then there is no reason to look for another hotel in Seattle.",
            "The Four Seasons Seattle is very well located, across from the Art Museum, a block from the Pike Market, and near most downtown locations of interest. The staff was extremely attentive, kind, and respectful. Views from the room are breathtaking. The hotel is modern and unlike most Four Season properties, but the rooms were quiet and peaceful. The hotel was a great choice for the end of our weeklong trip to the Pacific Northwest.",
            "I've never stayed at a Four Seasons so I was a newbie but I have never experienced that level of service anywhere! I love the location, the view, the bed, the bathroom. And the pool was great. My friend brought her three kids and we invaded the area with floaties and water wings and no one cared. They just brought us lots of water and towels and made us feel at home. I've stayed at the Fairmont also and while that was also a great place to stay, I just liked the feel of the FS a little more because of the modernity of the decor. I've made the decision that from now on, when I visit Seattle, the FS is the only place for me, expense be damned!",
            "I've statyed at the Four Seasons twice and would have rated it as excellent but on my second stay, when I visited with my wife, I booked a higher priced room which, oddly, wasn't as good as the lower category I'd had the time before. It was bigger but not really in a useful way - for example the bathtub in the smaller room was positioned so you could watch the very cool 'in mirror' TV whilst you couldn't do this in the larger room. Also the first room was nice and quiet at the end of a corridor with great views whilst the larger room was near the elevator, and had an adjoining room where the TV was clearly audible from our room - and the view wasn't as good as it had the other two sides of the hotel sticking out and getting in the way (it's sort of a 'C' shape'). Given those factors I didn't feel it was particularly great value. On the plus side the rooms are nicely furnished, the pool (and gym) have great views, food was excellent in the restaurant and service up to normal Four Seasons standards. Hotel is also well located next to Pike Place market (and near the very first Starbucks if you need a touristy fix!). Would stay again but will be more careful on room choice.",
            "The location of this hotel is great if you want to visit the waterfront and Pikes Market. The Market is just a block away, and we walked to lots of good restaurants from this location even though we had a car as well. Hotel also has car service for the guests which we used one evening and was terrific. We visited the lounge one evening and ended up in the middle of their happy hour which also features a wonderful cheese side bar with lots of great tasty fruits, nuts and breads which ended up being dinner one night.",
            "This is our third visit to 4S Seattle. We're spoiled, and you will probably see me replicating this review for any 4S property. 4S Seattle is particularly nice for an urban hotel because it is not a large property. The modern rooms are finely decorated and are exceptionally comfortable. Nice gym, but pool is a tad small for my taste [about 50 ft], since I like to swim laps. Lovely water view, even with Seattle Steam across the way, which actually adds to the appeal of the vista [think Pompidou Museum for real].",
            "Compared with other Four Seasons properties this hotel is disappointing. It has a beautiful and relaxing lobby, and very nice rooms, but other than that I was disappointed. It's in a noisy part of downtown Seattle; while you have a view of the water, the view is over some industrial buildings and an always-busy and very noisy expressway (the Alaska Way Viaduct). It is convenient to Pike Place Market, but I have hard a time imaging that the clientele that can afford this hotel is going to make more than 1 trip to the market. The really annoying thing about this hotel -- and the primary reason for my poor review -- is their terrible policy toward charging for wireless Internet service. Upon signing in and paying for an $11-day-per-day rate (crazy in and of itself), they prompt you to pay an additional $4 for \"premium\" service. If you don't pay the $4 upgrade, you get mediocre service -- not fast enough to watch simple Flash animation, for example. So Internet service equivalent to what you get in a Holiday Inn Express for *free* will cost you $15 a day. I've read in the paper that the owners of this hotel are in deep financial trouble and have refused to pay the company that built the hotel. I can only assume that they're trying to make up the difference by charging $15 for Internet service. One more thing - Fran's Chocalates (in the lobby) are great.",
            "I am a loyal Four Seasons customer and was very excited to have the chain come back to Seattle after many years of absence. Unfortunately, my first stay negated my excitement. The hotel is new and the rooms are reasonably nice and brand new, but not really up to Four Seasons standards. The furniture is light maple and the carpets are very bright. The entire place felt like it was built by high end Ikea. It doesn't look or feel luxurious. The other big problem is the location and the view. I paid extra for a waterview room, but it was dominated by a view of two big smokestacks and a construction site. Seattle has amazing water views but this hotel isn't situated in a spot that has them. In fact, it is still in a transitional neighborhood with a handful of peep shows and X rates theaters only a block away. The worst part of my stay, however, was my inability to take a normal shower. The water pressure in the shower was the lowest I've experienced in North America. I couldn't wash my hair and could barely get the soap off my body. Upon checkout I emailed the manager and he told me that the \"water pressure in my room was consistent with the hotel standard.\" I don't know what that means but it is not connsistent with any other place and certainly not a Four Seasons. Seattle has great luxury hotel choices in Hotel 1000 and the new Pan Pacific. There is no reason at all to put up with the shortcomings of this Four Seasons.",
            "My husband had a meeting in Seattle so we decided to make it a quick family get-away. This trip was for business and for pleasure combined. A friend from Seattle actually recommended the Four Seasons. The chain has been running some great deals lately; Stay longer package deals (stay 2 nights, get one in Houston/Seattle and several other cities), and we have been taking advantage! We stayed for 3 nights over a holiday weekend. So lucky to have PERFECT weather in Seattle and to take in all the great things the city has to offer. Walked and walked. Cant' think of a hotel with a better location to Pike's, etc! Very easy to get anywhere from the Four Seasons. For my taste, the decor was very comfortable, very lovely and soothing. Bathrooms were wonderfully big! They really treat families well, here - at all FS. Delivering pop corn and sodas and fresh made cookies upon check-in. Superb FS service: Late room service (although it did take a LONG time and one of my daughters feel asleep waiting for dinner to arrive) was very helpful to us. Housekeeping even located a lost earring for one of my daughters. The work out facility is really one of the better hotel fitness rooms I have used with the treadmills facing large windows with pool and water views. The pool deck was a nice surprise, got a little crowded on the warm, sunny days. Nice Spa and fire pit, also. The one downside I can think of is the staff could not seem to supply consistent information on whether food could be served pool side- it never was while we were there. The in house restaurant was OK - Four Seasons pricey, very pretty. Oh, and we got an 8am wake-up call one morning we did not request. Thank goodness it wasn't 5am! Staff was apologetic. All in all, the pluses far out weighed the minimal minuses in my opinion and I would not hesitate to stay at the FS if I return to Seattle.",
            "This is our third stay at the Four Seasons Seattle. We used to stay at the Fairmount, but it has become a bit tired, so we now prefer the FS. The one negative about the FS if you have kids is there is no indoor pool, which the Fairmount has. I like the modern, no fuss decor of the FS and the rooms are spacious with comfy reading chairs and lights. The lighting is good, which is important in the gray Seattle weather. This time I tried the spa and had a very good massage. My one disappointment with the FS is the restaurant. Breakfast is good, but lunch and dinner can be iffy. The food can be overly precious with too much emphasis on presentation and not enough on taste. If you have a child, however, you must order the \"space needle sundae\". The chef may be a dud, but the pastry chef is a genius! !",
            "We were warmly greeted at check-in and that warmth was maintained throughout our three night stay. Upon check-in we we received a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe bay view room and thoroughly enjoyed watching the ferries and cruise ships come and go and getting a glimpse of the Olympic Mountains beyond Elliot Bay. In addition, we were treated to a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries as an anniversary was being celebrated during our stay. We ate our breakfast at ART and everthing was delicious, especially the lemon ricotta pancakes. The location was convenient to everything. We walked through Pike Place Market and to Safeco Field for a Mariner's game. We aren't big shoppers but the shopping core was within a few blocks. If we ever need to stay in a hotel in Seattle again,we would definitely stay at the Four Seasons.",
            "Outstanding service, incredible amenities, and great views. Anytime you can stay at a Four Seasons, definitely do. The one in downtown Seattle is close to attractions, shopping, and outstanding restaurants. An experience that I will always hold as the baseline for hotels I stay at in the future.",
            "Only few tips : prefer seaview high floor ( noise from first road in the opposite side ) ; visit the swimming pool in the happy hour time ; walk up and down in the city to appreciate the location of this hotel . The rate is expansive ( try special offers ) but it is a very Four Seasons with comfort and perfect service .",
            "We have stayed a the Seattle Four Seasons on several occasions. Whether we are there for an evening at the Symphony, dinner in town, or to catch an early flight at SeaTac, the Four Seasons has always been a wonderful place to stay. The staff is oustanding and the valet/email/checkin process is excellent.",
            "We don't take many vacations but when we do we plan every detail. The internet pictures of the Four Seasons looked spectacular and won out over the Fairmont Olympic. We booked a two bedroom suite and couldn't wait to get to the room. What a disappointment!! Our $2100 per night view consisted of three smoke stacks billowing smoke and steam, a large storage building and an elevated nasty looking highway. Not the beautiful vision created on their homepage. The Hotel itself is ok and the service was excellent but overall not worth the expense. When I returned home I called the Four Seasons home office in Vancouver to express my dissatisfaction. No one really listened to me and the pictures on the home page are still there! I won't be coming back!! In my world it's called false representation.",
            "I am from the Seattle area, and stayed here overnight for a weekend in town to see a concert. As soon as we pulled in, we were promptly greeted and offered help with our bags, we politely declined as we only had overnight bags. Check in was fast and efficient. Before you knew it we were in our room. The room design was modern and clean. The bathroom was stunning with a very deep soaker tub and awesome shower with an overhead rain shower. One of my key criteria on rating a room is the shower and the water pressure. This one was top notch! The tv in the mirror was a nice touch which would be expected in a 5 star property. My other main criteria is the bed. This bed was uber comfy. i slept like a baby! After coming in pretty late from a concert it was nice to see the room turned down for bed, with the ice bucket filled and bottles of water on both nightstands. What a nice touch. We used the lounge prior to the concert. The cocktails are delicious if a tad pricey. But for being in a 5 star hotel I was not surprised at the prices. We also had breakfast in the hotel restaurant. The quality of food was amazing. I believe much of the produce is sourced from the nearby pike place market a major tourist draw. I would definitely recommend this place to out of town visitors and family, and would not hesitate to spend another weekend here for another special event like a concert.",
            "I am a very loyal customer to the Four Seasons Brand. I have stayed at my of the hotels all over the world and most recently the Four Seasons San Francisco and New York. Needless to say I am in love with the service and amenities that the brand offers. On a recent stay at the Four Seasons Seattle I was very disappointed. Firstly, the facilities were not of the Four Seasons Standard. The hotel seemed very dated although new. The service was not close to par with any other hotel I have stayed in. A good example is the doorman was on his cell phone while holding the door open and did not make any eye contact with me or my traveling partner as we entered the hotel. The front desk people checking us in were aloof and seemed unwelcoming when we arrived and did not warm up during our entire stay. The public restrooms next to the lobby was unclean and did not have toilet seat covers and when it was brought to the attention of the front desk, they look at us with the look as to say \"so\". Overall, I felt that I was staying at a nice Holiday Inn or a Sheraton or Hilton. The overall impression I got when leaving was that the hotel was going to benefit from the Four Seasons name alone and not do anything to uphold or enhance the standard. If I were at the hotels headquarters, I would reevaluate the general manager as the hotel can only be as good as the management deems. This is a failure for sure.",
            "This relatively new hotel is in a perfect location, about 2 blocks from Pike's Place market and the heart of touristy Seattle. Great water views, typically solid Four Seasons service with their outstanding beds make this a great downtown hotel with a FS twist. I did find some minor housekeeping shortcomings (ironing board wasn't put away after I used it, small bars of soap, clothes I left out weren't folded as they'd typically do in other FS properties) but this is still a stellar city hotel. I also had one of the best massages in my life while enjoying a little down-time here.",
            "We stayed here after a cruise and loved it. Everyone there was helpful and friendly. The hotel is newer so everything is still fresh and clean. I have a two year old and let them know when I made the reservations, if you have little ones this will be helpful for you. They set up a bed with side rails, a mini robe, and little slippers as well as a toy (which was a gift for her to keep). They also put toiletries in the bathroom for babies. The view from our room was phenomenal, the market one block away. Would definitely stay here again.",
            "As I walked past the desk moment's after arrival I looked over at the reception and there stood three agent's all with their head's down. It looked as if they might be doing their taxes? None looked up at me as I walked by. This hotel cost me $500 per night, your supposed to be ATTENTIVE!",
            "My Mother In-law purchased a room at the Four Seasons in Seattle for our Anniversary this last March. We loved the room and the location was great for walking around Pike Place Market and many restaraunts close by as well. The room was fabulous and there was even a TV IN the bathroom mirror!!! The tub was huge, easily big enough for two! They must have known it was our anniversary because within 20 minutes of checking in a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were delivered to the room! Very unexpected and wonderful!",
            "Was lucky enough to stay here for nearly two weeks and it is just the perfect place to stay. I fully agree with other reviewers - from front to back the service is top notch, no exception. Front desk, concierge, bar staff, doormen, room service, housekeeping - all worth mentioning as they were all exceptional. They really couldn't do enough! The practicalities are superb too - lovely spacious rooms, impeccably well designed and very quiet. Great bar and restaurant, well equipped gym, luxuriously decorated throughout, and the hotel is in a super location by the waterfront right smack in the centre of town. There really is no reason to stay anywhere else. Thanks to all at the hotel for a wonderful stay.",
            "I'm very lucky to be pretty well travelled and particularly experienced at American hotels! I'm a Westin devotee but hotels.com had a great deal on the Four Seasons, so we booked the first 3 nights of our honeymoon to stay there. It is quite simply one of the nices hotel rooms I've ever stayed in! The bathroom was amazing - so well designed, massive sunken bath, walk in shower, seperate toilet with it's own glass door, and a tv in the mirror! Bed was just as comfy as the wonderful westin Heavenly beds too. Loved it. Really well located for sight seeing in Seattle, and amazing fire feature in the lobby. Really welcoming too. Didn't try the food so can't comment on that but i'm sure it was great! If you're looking for a good restaurant in Seattle, try Etta's Seafood. Best food we found in town by far.",
            "I have been going to Seattle every summer for the past 15 years. No until this trip did I feel like I was staying in a place that could hold its own against the very chic hotels of NYC and LA. The hotel is very comfortable. Unlike other Four Seasons this one has a boutique feel to it. The lounge is great. There are great views of the sound with a few smoke stacks mixed in to give it a very city/industrial feel. I thought it was a very nice mix. The chairs were comfortable and the nightly happy hour with $5 food and drink specials was perfect and large. The room was nice and big. I was in a partial Bay view room which also looked down on the pool. The ferrys came in and out of port right next to the hotel so that was a nice addition to the view. The pool was the real treat. Unlike the old Four Seasons (the Olympic) This one is outdoors and gorgeous. There was a nice mix of both younger (20s and 30s) people as well as a few older couples, and the occasional child. The pool is full service with a bar on the weekends (you can have drinks all week but it takes a little longer). The view from the pool deck is perfect with almost no sign of the industrial waterfront below the hotel. All around I was expecting to hang out with friends and run around the city daily. Instead I hung out by the pool daily and enjoyed cocktails and snacks. I cant wait to go back.",
            "I took my parents here overnight in order to celebrate my Dad's 70th. What a wonderful hotel. Everything went without a hitch, including the champagne that I had pre^ordered. We had adjoining rooms and they were huge with luxurious bathrooms. We visited the lounge downstairs and our server was generous with our wine re-fills( I cannot stand being ripped off with just a sip). The only negative thing that I can say is that the water pressure is week and it doesn't heat up hot enough. My bar bill was reasonable as well. Keep up the great work Four Seasons!!! !",
            "Stayed 3 nights in early September in a harbour facing room. Fulfilled the usual high Four Seasons standard. Location is great - within walking distance of many things and easy reach of the main public transport. Best point: the pool and sunbathing area were an unexpected delight. The area is in shade until about lunchtime but then catches the sun for the rest of the day. There is drinks and food service. It's fantastic to have this facility in a city centre. Disappointing: the bar is functional but not an an interesting or welcoming space. Four Seasons can do good bars - like the one in New York - and this one needs some excitement."

            "We purchased airfare and hotel from Travelocity. Purchased room at Mercure in the suburbs. Hotel closed for Christmas so we were booked at the Mercure Arthur Frommer in city center instead. Thank you Jesus. Arthur Frommer located within walking distance of Dam Square, Rembrandt Square, Rijksmuseum, restaurants, shopping and canals. The furniture is spartan but that is OK. Breakfast buffet is pricey but there are plenty of alternatives. Staff spoke English well and they were very helpful. Overall, I was very pleased with the hotel and would recommend for anyone on a modest budget. You will not be disappointed.",
            "The hotel has excellent location- close to train station (only few stops by tram or 10 min by taxi), close to all museums and all attractions you should visit in Amsterdam. If you like walking everything is within walking distance. The museums and art galleries are app 40 min walk (or 10 min tram if you dont want to walk that far), Heineken museum is just around the corner, Anne's Frank museum is 15 min by walk- honestly I couldnt imagine better location. The hotel itself is lovely- its off the main roads so its nice and quiet (we had really good sleep, not disturbed by any noise) and the rooms are simply charming. After stays in hotels that look the same, regardless where you are, its such a nice change as the room was lovely with more of personal touch. It wasnt very spacious, but its Amsterdam, you wouldnt expect lots of space, and the design of the room made up for lack of space. We had breakfast only one morning, and although its a bit pricey as other reviews mention, we were absolutely spoiled with choice. The selection was very impressive, much better in other Mercures. All members of staff vere excellent, very helpful and always there for you. There is simply nothing bad I could say about this hotel and our stay, everything was lovely, some things eg location, better than expected. Definately will book this hotel for next trip to Amsterdam:)",
            "Good location, quiet, yet within very easy walking distance to the main shops and bars and restaurants. Trams 16, 24, 25 run from close by to city centre tickets can be purchased from most shops. Trams are every few minuets, so you are never waiting around for long. On arriving at Schiphol airport, and not knowing our way around, we went to the tourist information desk and bought a return ticket for the shuttle bus, which took us right to our hotel. If you have never been to Amsterdam before like us, then I can recommend you use this or you may never know how to get to the hotel. For 19 euros it was easy. The hotel staff are all very helpful and polite, the rooms are basic and well maintained, and not bad size wise, which were cleaned every day. They have a free safe deposit box, T V with some English channels as well as Dutch. The bathrooms are average in size with shower, however the showers do not have doors, and water goes all over the bathroom floor unless you turn the shower head against the wall, but there is always plenty of hot water. Continental breakfast, with a good variety on offer. Part of the hotel is none smoking, which suited us fine. You must buy a good map, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on the small free maps that are given away. Always be careful of the cyclists, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a dam and seem to have right of way, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to stop if you get in their way. The Anne Frank museum is well worth a visit, but be warned, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very moving experience. The Heineken experience is also a must. For 10 euros you get about 3 hours of fun and drinking. We certainly had a good time at the Arthur Frommer, and can recommend this hotel to the more mature traveller.",
            "Our room was small but had high ceilings and a large window so felt light and airy. It was on the first floor (middle floor) and overlooked Noorderstraat. It was mainly pretty quiet.The bathroom (with walk-in shower) was generous and well appointed. The double bed was spacious and very comfortable and we slept well. There was plenty of wardrobe space and excellent flexible lighting. The breakfast was of a high standard - freshly squeezed orange juice, lovely croissant, eggs cooked to order - lots of choice.. The staff were always polite and helpful. The location was perfect for us, near the quieter pretty Prinsengracht and Reguliersgracht canals, but also only yards from the tram stop. It was easy enough to walk to the museum area and Vondelpark, or along the canals to Anne Fran's House, or into the city centre. Several good cafes nearby. (The Myrabelle deserves a mention here). A great stay. Recommended.",
            "We stayed here in Nov 2009 and although the colour schemes are a little bold, we found this place very good value for money and a good all round hotel. The 3 person room we stayed in was a decent size, clean, and well maintained. The only potential issue was the rather small corner window, which did almost nothing to light up the room (althogh this was acceptable and I belive ours was the only room with the unique window, due to it's postiion on the building corner). We didnt try the breakfast, but it seamed very nice (and expensive at EURO 16.50). I would happily return to this hotel and recommend it to others.",
            "The hotel is very good and clean. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 5 minute walk to Flower Market and other attractions, so very close to the city centre, but in a quiet street. There are plenty of nice restaurants and bars nearby. Staff at reception were helpful and friendly. The only weird thing is that the cleaning lady knocked at the door at 9:30 AM (on the 2 mornings we stayed there) and within one second she was inside the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not very good for privacy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Apart from that everything else was fine. Would stay there again and recommend it.",
            "The hotel is close to tram but far away from the noise. Located on a quiet street, this is a true gem. And it is less than 5 minutes away from all the action. In my opinion it's strategically located between the Museum area, the tourist area (Dam) and the trendy Leidseplein. All within walking distance, no more that 10 min. Tram is about two blocks away. The staff was courteous and Ismael was truly helpful, even though he was a trainee.",
            "Stay in this hotel many times and as always the staff are greater. Only compliant is about the book web site which makes it difficult to book long periods. This stay was for 19 days but had to be broken into shorter say becuase the web site would not let me book it as one stay",
            "the rooms and bathroom was ideal for a short weekend away, the bed comfy and the general condition was nearly new. one poor point was at reception you cannot have a room allocated before 2 or 3pm 9although luggage storage offered), unless you upgrade 30 euros to get your room early. I will assume the hotel is always full and so no rooms are free until once cleaned. also a tea and coffee tray is 5 euros, being a regular traveller its usually the norm to have them available within the room rate",
            "I have previoulsy stayed at this same hotel before with 2 friends and our triple room was fine. Good decor, good beds... this time, I came back for a double room and had a somehow negative surprise: room was much smaller, with a much poorer decor... and very very very noisy - every single morning, we were woken up by the continuous noise of doors, cleaning... really unpleasant. We did get an early checkin, which was great, but the staff was not pleasant with us at all - made crystal clear to us they were doing us a big favor. And that continued during the whole stay. Lobby was recently renewed and looks much better - but not a very good taste, I would say. The room was small, but fair - good equipment, good bed. Bathroom was small as you expect in Europe -and had the basics. Just an important note to women: they do have a hair dryer but it's crap. So if you need a dryer, better take yours, because that things if just for them to put at their website they have a hair dryer. They do have ONE single PC you can use with internet access - but many sites are bloked. And I mean regular sites - I couldnt access my email because the site was blocked (it's my company's public website), and I guarantee there's nothing pron or not appropriate there. Staff just told me there was nothing they could do. At the end, I could at least print my boarding pass there, at least... Price was not cheap, so it's definetly not a good cost benefit relatoinship. The only excellent thing is location - between the center and the museum district, near cannals... really nice location. At the end, the experience showed us that the management and staff really do not care about guests' experience - all those details that show they care lack, at all levels.",
            "This charming hotel in a quiet mews near many attractions, excelled in all areas. The entrance and recepton staff were welcoming and efficient. The bedroom we were allocated had taseful elegant, high quality furnishings with a comfortable bed, pillows and warm duvet. Other room facilites included a mini bar and flat screen TV. The shower room was a good size with a high standard of cleanliness. The breakfast room had been well thoughtout with a large variety of food and the only minor irritation , was no facility for making toast.",
            "Just returned from a fab weekend in Amsterdam. We booked a triple room which initially I had reservations from previous reviews, but there was plenty of room. The bathroom was nice and modern however there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke in there which was slightly off putting. The beds are very comfortable with feather pillows and thick duvet. One thing that let it down was the air conditioning. It was too hot in the night and for some reason the air con kept switching to warm air during the night. It was quite noisy trying to sleep at night with people banging doors when they got in but I thankfully packed ear plugs which blocked everything out. The hotel is in a great location, approx 15 min walk to Dam square which we were happy to do each day. There is a tram stop nearby too which we used once, very straight forward. Overall I would recommend this hotel but I think it's pot luck with what room you get.",
            "I very much wanted to give this hotel five stars, but after a long journey, the first night was farcical - no sleep all night because of the noise from the central heating and then to cap that, deafening work started at 7am on the adjacent building site right outside my window. I fully accept that the hotel has no control over the building work, but it appears that the central heating problem is known to the owners. I know from my own experience of operational management that these things can be difficult to fix immediately, and the commendable staff changed my room without hesitation, but the fact remains I lost a whole night's sleep and, as that is the main point of a hotel, I feel I wasted my money and lost the enjoyment of a day's sightseeing through tiredness. I would have been very upset if I had only been staying one night and had a business appointment next day. Once the room was changed though, the noise - whilst still there - was bearable, and I was able to enjoy the very comfortable bed, good spacious shower and efficient, friendly service. The hotel is extremely clean, tastefully decorated in a modern style and situated in a peaceful residential area, although most attractions were only ten minutes or so away. I didn't try breakfast and I thought having to pay 5 Euros (per day) for a basic tea/coffee facility in the room was rather odd, but maybe that's the way things are done here. Overall, the good points notably outweighed the bad points. Once the heating problem is resolved and the building work completed next door, this will be an easy five out of five and I would definitely come back again. Until then, unfortunately, I can only rate it three stars and advise that visitors proceed with a degree of caution at the moment.",
            "I booked at the Mercure because I wanted a moderately priced hotel not far from the city center. I didn't expect it to great but overall it beat my expectations. The room was clean, the bed was reasonably comfortable. There's a kindergarten just outside so there's a nice cheery vibe around the neighborhood and not a little noise at times (which I personally found rather charming). The front desk staff were cheerful and helpful, though I must say I didn't present any particular challenges. Overall, I thought this was a good place to stay. That said, I didn't love the fact that the closet and bathroom were on a different level than the rest of my room, accessible via a metal staircase. It's tedious to get up in the middle of the night and fumble up the steep stairs (slight digression: Amsterdam on the whole has the steepest stairs I've ever seen. Plan those trips to the bathroom accordingly). My room may have been the only one in the hotel with this arrangement. Or not. They didn't tell me. If they had asked whether I wanted the climb-to-the-bathroom-room I probably would have declined. I also would have had a lot less beer the first evening I was there. At least I got my exercise during the night. One thing to remember if you stay here: keep the address with you. Cab drivers without exception didn't know the hotel by the \"Mercure Arthur Frommer\" name and there are 3 Mercures in town. If I hadn't had the address in my phone to show them they never would have known where to go. Bottom line for me: I would go back happily, but would avoid room 112. Value for the money was better than expected.",
            "The room was small, plain, and clean. The bath was about the size of one in an airplane, but there was a small pub on site, and it was a short walk to downtown. all in all, for the price I was satisfied",
            "We stayed here for 3 nights in November 2010. The hotel is on tram line from airport. Get off at Heinekin Brewery and its a 3 block walk. It down a very quiet street so it was nice sleeping. We did not eat breakfast here. There was a bagel and coffee shop 2 blocks away and also some restaurants in the area. But it was just 3 or trams stops to Dam Square. Front desk was helpful with a map. Would stay here again. Rooms nice and bathrooms very nice",
            "Great hotel in a fantastic location, hidden away in a mainly residental area but just a few minutes walk from the Prinsengracht. Our room was delightfully decorated and very quiet. Comfortable bed and the bathroom facilities were excellent. The TV had a number of English speaking channels and the mini-bar well stocked and not hugely overpriced!! My only gripe is the price of the hotel breakfast, 17.50Euro per person is rather crazy in my opinion - and obviously we didn't partake! There are plenty of local cafes nearby and even an organic supermarket in the vicinity should you wish to purchase food on the go. We didn't sample the downstairs bar - but it looked smart. I'd definitely recommend :)",
            "Stayed in this hotel on probably the most freezing weekend ever in Amsterdam was -15 degrees, also coupled with some snow, Scotland where we left was more tropical. Asides from this the hotel was excellent arrived at 245am due to airport delays the man on reception was friendly and helpful and the rooms were warm. Cleanliness was excellent in the rooms and the staff on reception were helpful too all with excellent English. Only downside was paying for the tea but bearing in mind the temperature I probably wouldnt have took this option if it hadnt been so cold out. The tv had English spoken channels too which was handy. The location was great a nice quiet area but still close enough to the action once figured out where we were going. Would definetly stay here again when I return to Amsterdam.",
            "Booked this hotel as two ,middle aged ,women away for a few days break, after reading recommendations from others on here. We haven't been been disappointed at all. It's in a quiet street away from the main touristy places yet only a short stroll away from everything. Just been to the steak restaurant on the same street which is lovely (too shattered to walk any further after been out all day till six). And now sat watching tv in the room. We booked a privilege room (214)which is great and has tea making, dressing gowns slippers and a large bottle of water everyday - it was only a few euros more booked in advance on the Mercure site. Yes the walls aren't soundproofed ,it's an old building. Do wish they would get some better door closers on the rooms to stop them banging closed though - or only allow considerate guests to stay! We had breakfast at the bagel cafe and broodhuys, both great - broodhuys doesn't take cash and doesnt have any normal English breakfast tea though. We have walked and walked, had a great time and would stay again.",
            "If you want to stay in historic Amsterdam, in an old Amsterdam building, tucked alongside the canals and cobbled streets, this is the place. The rooms have the big windows and high ceilings that you expect from an old Amsterdam house. The light floods into the room. The bathrooms are a little compact, but kitted out with everything you need. The reception team are very helpful. It is a 15 minute walk from Muntplein or Leidseplein if you want tourist restaurants and bars. It is a 2 minute walk to the nearest tram stop. We ate out for breakfast, or picked up a picnic from the one of the many stores/deli's nearby. The buffet breakfast in the hotel is EUR 16 per person, but we did take up the EUR5 a day coffee/tea making facilities.",
            "I enjoyed the location of the hotel, but the room had a very worn out, dated look to it, and the bathroom was ridiculously funky. The carpet seemed unclean, the blankets and pillows very old and uninviting. Most annoying was the low level of sound proofing in the facility--this is a good hotel for people who don't mind the sound of doors slamming day and night. Many of the guests seemed to have little regard for others' sleep; there was lots of hollering out in the hall. The windows could use improvement, as even on the quiet street we faced, there were motorists and drunken revelers passing by in the wee hours of the night. While some of the desk clerks we encountered there were helpful and professional, one was downright rude about giving directions to the VanGogh museum upon our arrival and another was curt and impatient. Breakfast was just so-so; we only ate there once and preferred to walk to Village Bagel on the main street. Unfortunately, the main street leading to Noordestraat was all torn up and under construction, which gave our approach to the property an industrial, unpleasant feel. But once we wandered through the canal streets east of the hotel, we fell under the spell of Amsterdam. We wished we'd opted for a hotel on a canal, with a little more charm. The Mercure Arthur Frommor was just utilitarian.",
            "The Mercure Arthur Frommer is located right on the edge of the City Center, making it an ideal hotel if you're in Amsterdam for work. The staff are great and the facilities are decent. If you go in the winter, the heaters in the rooms tend to take a long while to warm up, so it can get chilly at times. Overall, it was a decent hotel and great value!",
            "Pros: Good location. Very friendly staff. Cons: Hotel is run down. Clean, but need some attention paid to it. Room was really small. Located in an alleyway, which made getting home at night a little scary. Bottom Line: Basic hotel if you're looking for something cheap, but I wouldn't stay here again.",
            "The hotel is located in a quiet side street just outside the main centre of Amsterdam. It is within easy walking distance of the central area of Rembransplein, Dam and Leidseplein, museum area. The hotel is well-served by public transport, particularly by tram with direct lines to the Central Station in about 10 minutes (4-5 stops) and Leidseplein (2 stops/10 mins walk). The hotel is very clean and has a modern interior. The room was well-laid out, the bathroom was clean and modern, there was a wide range of TV channels in several different languages. Quality of sleep was excellent (very quiet area) although I was woken each morning by slamming doors, whether from other guests or cleaning staff I am not sure. I did not take breakfast at the hotel. At 16 euros this appeared to be quite steep. The hotel had 1 internet terminal in the lobby, which was heavily used, and when I did have a chance to use it it was very slow. However this is an excellent choice for a hotel in one of the most popular cities in Europe.",
            "Hotel was ok and in a very good location, but the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac45 per night parking charge was extortionate. We were also advised on arrival that our rate included breakfast but when we checked out we discovered it wasn't and had to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17.50 each per day. We'd have eaten out if we'd known. The rooms and cleanliness were fine.",
            "This is a great little hotel - it's not posh, it just does the essentials really well. The location is great - about 20 - 30 minutes walk to the Old Town and 10 minutes from Leidesplein or Rembrantsplein. It's in a quiet residential area so not much traffic or drunken reveller noise. Rooms are small but nicely decorated. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Breakfast was tasty. All in all, \u00c2\u00a3300 for a double room for 3 days including breakfast seemed like a damn good deal. Would definitely stay again.",
            "We choose this hotel from trip-advisor recommendation. Great choice, best location, very nice and quiet street. The service is very effective. The room was clean and spacious. The hotel was recently renovated and everything is new. Breakfast and breakfast room - a must. In summary, we will be back!",
            "We stayed here as part of package deal and it turned out to be a very pleasant hotel. The location was very good and within easy walking distance of everything. The street was very charming. The hotel was clean and the room was a good sized. There is nothing so special about this hotel, but if you are looking for a safe, reasonably priced hotel in a nice area of Amsterdam, then stay here.",
            "The location is great: a quiet neighborhood, but a moderate walk to anywhere in central Amsterdam and quite close to the museums. Just a few blocks to several trams. Rooms are small (judging from the floor plan, mine was one of the smallest, but comfortable and with a relatively large bath and shower). I think the soundproofing is a bit lacking; I wasn't bothered much by noise, but I could imagine that noisy neighbors in the hallway might be a problem. Breakfast is good, but not cheap. Staff is efficient and friendly.",
            "We stayed for 2 nights and wanted to stay near Leideseplein but didnt want to go over budget. This hotel is definitely off the beaten path, but its not too far from some of the main areas. The plus is that you are in a quiet area and its peaceful to walk around and not crowded with tourists. Very comfortable beds, good size rooms and bathrooms. Internet worked good. Great bagel cafe 3 blocks away around the corner from the hotel. Wasn't in Amsterdam too long so didnt spend too much time in the hotel. But it was all we needed and not to bad of a walk to get places. Would definitely stay here again, however, we may want to stay in a different area if we go back.",
            "Small hotel on a small and quiet side street in Amsterdam. Had to walk a bit to get to the central area but it didn't ever take long. Nice and helpful staff. Good selection in their breakfast bar. Rooms are a bit tight for a family of 3 (our child is 17) but they did manage to fit in an extra bed without too many problems. We were never in the room for anything but sleeping any way. If you like quiet and a little off the beaten path then this is the perfect hotel. We would stay here again. Also...there is a shuttle from the airport to get here and take you back again. It does cost but inexpensive compared to a taxi.",
            "This hotel is located in a quieter area of Amsterdam about a 5 min walk to the main action. It's actually pretty good if you dont want to be around all the sleaziness of central Amsterdam. Price was great about $70 for the room as we booked pretty early. Rooms a little small but beds were very comfy. Wifi a little strange giving you vouchers with access numbers that expire after 24 hours. Still a great midrange option in Amsterdam.",
            "Stayed at this property on March 12 - 15 with a friend. Staff was very nice, although no one offered to assist us with our bags. At the entrance, there's a small flight of stairs and the elevator is tiny. They have a computer in the lobby where you can surf the internet for free. Or you can purchase wifi time via T-Mobile HotSpot in your room...you can buy by the hour and split up your time during your stay. Front desk manager was nice enough to print out my train confirmation when asked if they had a printer (which they do not have a public one). Room was okay...not huge but not tiny. It was comfortable for us. Location was wonderful. We were within walking distance of the Heineken Experience and the main street to catch the tram. There was a supermarket nearby, coffeehouse around the corner and some places to eat. It cost us $11 for a taxi ride from Centraal Train Station to the hotel. I would definitely stay here again. We didn't do the breakfast so I have no comment to offer on the food.",
            "Have stayed here a couple of times. The hotel is basic for the cost and so much more could be done with it based on its great heritage. The hotel doesn't offer much by way of facilitys, expensive breakfast and a small dingy bar but the rooms are comfy dispite being very basic but have some charm about them. The loctaion is the best thing as it's in a quiet residential area next to a small school yet it is only a short walk to all the main areas. That is the main reason I always choose this hotel.",
            "We stayed here for 4 nights and wanted a nice hotel to use as a base when sightseeing around Amsterdam. It was ideal for us! We got a tram from the central station and then a short walk to the hotel. The hotel is tucked away on some residential streets, so nice to be away from the hustle and bustle. Our room was a good size - big, comfortable bed, ensuite shower room (small but newly refurbished). We were out and about sightseeing so only came back to our room to sleep, but had a good stay and would definitely recommend it. The bedrooms are nice and fresh as have been recently refurbished. It was good value for money.",
            "Stayed here for a three night break, had originally booked a standard room, but upon arrival early Monday decided to take them up on their offer of upgrading to a superior room for an extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 per night, and room was available immediately. Stayed in room 112 which is a large room, with floor to ceiling double aspect windows, flooding the room with natural light... Lovely. Bathroom is compact, but everything is there and plenty of amenities which are topped up every day. We purchased a four day pass for the trams, and within a day realised how very very easy it is to use, and the fact the hotel is slightly further out than others, means that you have a really quiet night sleep. Everything is sparkling clean. The reception staff are polite and helpfull, and more than happy to provide you with information on where to go, helping us to print off our boarding passes ... We had their mini breakfast one day ... So we sat in their bar area and Amin (I think) served us in there. Very charming, if we wanted more coffee etc not a problem, just ask. I didn't like having the packet creamer on our coffee tray in our room, not a problem, within five minutes housekeeping presented me with a jug of milk to put in our fridge. I like the fact the hotel decor is different, eccletic and so very clean. Thank you for a lovely stay.",
            "All I want from a city hotel is comfortable bed, big breakfast and great location. Mercury Arthur Frommer was a great choice. 5 min walk to Rembrandt Sq, 10 min to Leidse Sq., and about 10min ride by tram to Central St. ( stop is just 3min away - 2.80eur ). Location is very romantic and safe. Building is in residential area...no traffic...what a blisful sleep accomplished by very comfy bed and soft linens. Rooms are not huge but ok and showers are modern and clean and contains some shower gel,soap etc. Decor is corky and fresh, especially the stripy carpet is really cute. Check in fast, not overly friendly, but decent enough. And breakfast (included in my deal) was fabulous. Big selection of breads, pastries etc. Juices,coffees, fresh fruits, cold bar...more than you need. So overall stay was very pleasant and next time in Amsterdam...I am back in Mercury.",
            "I cannot believe the prior posts. My experience in this hotel was excellent! CHEAP, CLEAN and with FRIENDLY STAFF. Clean air conditioned rooms, bathroom including amenities (soap, shampoo, lotion), very friendly staff always willing to help you with directions and maps and well located (1 1/2 block away from the nearest tram stop). A grocery store is 1 block away, a couple of restaurants are about 160 feet from the hotel and the Heineken Museum is a short walk distance. This hotel is now part of the Accor chain hotels. Maybe those awful experiences I read in the prior reviews happened before this Mercure Frommer hotel acomplishes the Accor standard. I totally recommend this hotel for young people with a controlled budget.",
            "We booked through Airmiles to stay 2 nights at this hotel. The Airmiles pictures definitely make the hotel look more luxurious than it is in person. The fixtures and furnishings in the bedroom are ready for refurbishment and the bathroom needs a deep clean. The location is ideal for exploring Amsterdam and there are tram links close by. Don't hail a cab unless you can speak Dutch because we were truly ripped off; I don't think the taxi driver realised we had been in Amsterdam for a couple of days and had walked the road numrous times when he took the scenic route and charged us E15 for what should have been a 3km journey. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is good - healthy and fresh with plenty of choice, but don't expect service with a smile. General value for money was about average, I reckon.",
            "Stayed for 4 nights at Arthur Frommer. Room was on 3rd floor, facing over the street, at the front of the hotel. We'd booked a twin, but actually got a room with a large double and a single, so we had lots of room. Very impressed with the cleanliness and standard of housekeeping. The beds were supremely comfortable, and the ensuite, whilst compact, was modern, stylish and featured a large shower, with non-stop hot water and plenty of towels. Having read other reviews of the hotel, I'm surprised that people have complained about the noise. We heard nothing at all from neighbouring rooms, and could only occasionally hear doors closing further down the corridor - certainly nothing to cause a problem. The street is quiet. There is a school/nursery nearby, but the noise is only intermittent during the day, and, to be honest, it's a nice sound anyway. Location is terrific. Tram runs past end of the street but we pretty much walked everywhere. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the Oude Kerk and the same to walk to The Jewish Quarter or the Museum Quarter. You're just a few steps away from some of the prettiest stretches of canal. There's a large supermarket a block away with everything you might need and several cafes/ restaurants within very easy reach. The area felt very safe, even late at night. Reception staff extremely helpful and professional, and speak pretty impeccable English. They helped with directions, booking the airport shuttle etc. Only two downsides. (1) breakfast not inc and charged at approx 18 euros pp per day. We skipped this and got what we needed from the supermarket. (2) no tea tray in room but is offered at a rate of 5 euros a day. I thought this was a bit poor - it surely can't cost much to put a modest hospitality tray in the room and it's nice to be able to get a hot drink when you want it. These are the 2 reasons why i've not scored top marks.",
            "good points - clean, comfortable, many languages spoken by polite & helpful staff. quiet street close to romantic canals and friendly bars bad points breakfast overpriced & slow delivery of request for coffee in room (over 30 mins), room smaller than expected but upgrade was possible. summary - excellent hotel for romantic visit to Amsterdam but consider upgrading orm basic room",
            "This hotel was excellent. In a very quiet street, away from the red light district but still walking distance from all the main attractions. Hotel staff were pleasant. It was an advantage having a 24 hour manned reception desk. Close to breakfast spots, museums and restaurants. Definitely worth the money.",
            "This hotel is a hidden gem in Amsterdam. It is in a secluded courtyard just off one of main roads leading to the Dam Square and Central Station. Most of the main sights are in easy walking distance. The Staff were v friendly and efficient, speaking english as one of their many languages. Booking in was v easy. Our Room was clean and airy, the Bed was v confortable, with a good ensuite wc/shower. Breakfast was of qood qualitiy continental style, the waiting staff were good. Eggs were cooked to order. The reception staff gave us good directions to help get our bearings on our first venture out. They also recommended good restaurants nearby, which we did manage to visit. Only down side to our stay was the lack of compilmentary tea/coffee facilities in the room, but these were available from the reception for a charge. We would stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel to others",
            "We stayed here last year almost same time and came again last weekend for 2 nites. Its 200m from tram stop which takes you in 10 mins to city centre, 200m from mini supermarket for extras and 50m from Mellow Yellow, a great coffee shop...... There is no restaurant in hotel only small bar but several to choose from within 500m. We ate first nite at Les Fles on next canal north about 250m & next nite at authentic indonesian on Utrechstrasse, Tempoe Doeloe which was quite special, about 600m. We find eating out in Amsterdam expensive for food and wine but it is too in Lindon! Its 25m off main road so quiet at nite, stylish with a nice courtyard and nice rooms. The room we had on first stay was on ground (1) floor, last weekend was on 3rd floor so not so grand in attic but still well appointed with Velux window. We did not realise room had air con until 2nd nite when we awoke too hot and switched it on. Only disappointment is that no rooms seem to have bath tubs only showers, and the breakfast is expensive unless you are all inclusive.",
            "Stayed in this wonderful hotel for two nights and couldn't have had a more enjoyable stay. Placed in a charming street, within walking distance of canals, shops and attractions, it was spotlessly clean, with trendy decor, lovely bar & restaurant and staff were very efficient and friendly. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",
            "I stayed here for 2 nights this month. The hotel is on a quiet residential street which is within a 10-15 minute walk from the main shopping areas etc. Rooms are pretty spacious and have a nice bright colour scheme. I was given a room on the 3rd floor which was very cosy and quiet. In fact I didn't see any other guests while I was there at all. Breakfast is served in the basement room, with a wide range of food available and I would recommend it. Although I think it is quite expensive if not included in your rate. The staff are very friendly and have lots of info on what to do in Amsterdam. The only downside of the hotel I could see were that they didn't have anywhere to eat or any room service. There is a restaurant just along the street from the hotel as well as some other places nearby though.",
            "Location: Tucked away from main street, the hotel really feels like part of the neighbourhood. Very quiet and quaint. It's a great location, not too far from anything. Easily accessible from three tram lines, 16, 24, 25. At night, after clubbing, if you don't want to wait for the night bus, you can always walk home as well (since Amsterdam is very compact). I was clubbing in Leidsplein area and walked home in 15-20 mins. In the morning, Every morning, I walked 5-10 mins to Munt-Plein (Flower market) and had breakfast along the canal there. Cleanliness: Very clean and recently remodeled so toilet fixtures, beddings, TV, desk, etc are all in great condition. Room/Computer: I was in 308, their top floor, so I had a slanted roof. I have no problem walking around, but tall people might hit the ceiling. There was a PC in the lobby for everyone to use free of charge. Value: Hotel prices tend to be higher in AMS due to its limited availability. Mercure provides a good balance between value, location, and facility. Overall: Very happy with my stay, a cozy room without that boring hotel feel.",
            "I booked the hotel through flying blue miles for 3 nights for me, my wife and my 16th months' son. Everyone was really very friendly, the rooms are extremely clean and nice, breakfast rich and of very good quality and the area, where the hotel is, very quiet. Also it is located close to the centre of the town and we could reach all the places we were intereseted to visit by foot, which was very important especially considering that we were travelling with a small kid. End of the day we were very happy about it and, in case we are back in Amsterdam, this hotel will be our first choice.",
            "The hotel is very good, the staff very friendly. Location is quite good. Not gobsmacked in the city, but close to all of attractions. We were able to checked in before the say-so checking time, and we were asked whether we would like to leave our luggage after we checked out. The bed is AMAZING, the pillows were so nice, it made me want to throw pillows I have at home and get one that is exactly like the ones at the hotel. TV has zillions of channel (maybe not zillions, but it seems like never ending channels). BUT... I requested when I booked that we would like 1 double bed and 1 single, instead I got 3 singles. When asked how come we got singles bed, they nonchalantly that the particular room has been given away, so O well, what can we do kinda attitude. All good, I'm not fussy. Next, we were advised that wifi is available entire hotel. We didn't get it in our room, maybe because our room was kinda underground, so the wifi doesn't get to our area. The most disturbing part is, when I went to shower, there are A LOT of dead bugs on the floor. It seems that (maybe) the room has been unoccupied for sometime and hasn't been clean again when we get there. Overall a good stay, if only there are no bugs on the bathroom floor...",
            "This is a charming hotel in a great location in the central city. It's walking distance to many things, including the famous museums, and a short tram ride to central station. The rooms are small, but comfortable and clean, and have all the usual amenities, including free wireless internet. I did not try the breakfast, since it was rather expensive (17.50 euro), and there were nice bakeries right around the corner. The staff were helpful and friendly, and made me feel very welcome. I would definitely return to this hotel on my next trip to Amsterdam.",
            "Hotel is situated in a quiet part of the city, about 20 minutes walk from the main tourist areas. It is rather difficult to find because of the narrow one-way streets, but is worth the effort. Overall we had a happy experience, except for a shock on check-out when we were charged 90 euros for two days parking. No mention had been made of this at any time.",
            "We hve just returned from a 2 night trip to Amsterdam staying in this excellent hotel. The hotel couldnt have been better. It was spotless and the staff were so helpful and caring and efficient. The choice of food served at breakfast was first class, and there was something for all tastes. The position was also excellent as all the main places to visit were in walking distance. We would definately revisit and would have no hestitation in recommending it to anyone.",
            "The hotel is in a canal belt and easily walkable to the main attractions - the Heineken Experience, Anne Frank and the Rijks and Van Gogh Museums. Its not in party central, which means quiet nights. Also there is a tram stop nearby on the main road. I had no problems getting around Amsterdam from this base. The reception is currently undergoing renovation, which isn't pretty. Hans checked me in and he was courteous and welcoming. The double room was small, but pretty good value for Amsterdam standards, and the new furnishings were lovely. The walls were painted a dark blue, which may not be to everyone's taste but the look went well with the coloured carpets and decor. Lots of restaurants in the area, and there are cafes, a deli and a bagel shop just around the corner.",
            "Hotels in Amsterdam in Amsterdam expensive! This hotel is a great price for the quality and nice and modern. The 1 euro bus/van hop on hop off that runs around and stops anywhere is very very close to the hotel and well worth using. Hotel also really close to the Heiniken factory!!! Worth staying at.",
            "Rooms are clean and look nice but at about 2-5am the pipe works for the hotels central heating fires up and you hear constant noise in the rooms from radiator pipes (even if the radiator is switched off). We stayed 4 nights and were moved rooms 3 times and all the rooms same problems. If you are a light sleeper like me the hotel is not good. You also hear a lot of noise from other rooms as the walls are thin.",
            "We stayed at the Mercure Amsterdam Arthur Frommer for 3 nights in January 2010. We stayed many times at Accor hotels before (whether Sofitel / Mercure or Novotel) and never had to complain. However, Mercure Amsterdam Arthur Frommer deserves one. It took us 25 minutes to check-in, as the receptionist was being rude to a guest instead of trying to help and confort. This caused the guest to complain even more. She was not kind with any of the following guests, including us. Guests in front of us were Gold members and asked for an upgrade. She replied with a straight rude 'no ugrade, sorry'. We asked for a basic info, she replied she did not know. Rooms are good and modern, positions was excellent, in the middle of some of the nicest canals. At check-out, again, a receptionist, this time a loud man, was rude to a guest that complained about high extra charges. Apparently they charge EUR 20 for parking, EUR 5 for internet., EUR 10 for coffe in the room. Again only 1 receptionist and 6 guests checking out. Some guests wanted lo leave baggages at the hotel for a while. Considering the queue, the receptionist could have collected them, and deposit them later. On the contrary he rudely inticated the way to the guests, left the reception, and went with them to a store room very far away. When he came back, looking quite distressed and upset that the queue was getting longer, he entered a room, to exit after a minute. He kept speaking so loud that everybody could hear all other guests: name, surname, details of nights stayed, minibar, movies watched. In short Agreable hotel, but AWFULLY RUDE reception staff. Will not come back.",
            "The hotel is located quite centrally with being in an overly crowded area. You can get a day pass and hop on the tram that stops really close by and takes you directly to the Dam Square. There are a few cafes and restaurants nearby. Leidepleinssquare is about 5 minutes walk. Actually, everything is quite close on foot. The hotel is nice and clean. Check in was fine and everyone is friendly. The only downside are the very small rooms, which do not leave much room for luggage, while the bathroom is fairly large with quite some unused space. Note that there is a school across the street, so when you get a room facing east, you will hear screaming in the morning. All in all a good value. I would go back.",
            "I stayed in a triple room for two nights. The hotel looks nice and is very well located, most attractions are on walking distance. The breakfast was perfect for me, plenty of healthy choices. The only disadvantage was that the hotel was rather noisy on the second night. There is also no double glass so there might be noise from the street. However, I slept very well because of the great beds!",
            "I have visited this hotel three times in the last two years. Always very clean and quiet, excellent breakfast. Rooms at second and top floor are also extremely charming and big, while the rooms at ground floor are very small and those next to the service entry are noisy. There is no price difference really, so first bookings get the better rooms... Public transport is very close and connects perfectly both directly to the city center and on the circle lines around the city.",
            "We took our two children to Amsterdam for a few days in March and were really pleased with this hotel. It is in a great location - a quiet side street away from hustle and bustle, but within easy walking distance of plenty of things to see & do. The hotel was very clean & the staff very friendly, particularly towards the children (who incidentally loved the artwork in the room). The tv able to receive BBC was an unexpected bonus for the kids. Breakfast was typically European but plenty of it.",
            "This hotel was comfortable, clean, and offered great service. The room was smaller than American hotel rooms, but it was enough space for the two of us and the bathroom was bigger than average. Modern details and fantastic customer service at the front desk made this hotel feel like home during our stay in Amsterdam. It is located on a quiet street a block from a canal and is walkable to major attractions.",
            "We stayed at this hotel May 11-13, 2011. The rooms are modern, clean. The beds are ex excellent. The bathroom excellent. There is no restaurant, and the breakfast is a little pricy - but the staff are most helpful and welcoming. The location is not bad, a little walk or tram ride away from most tourist spots. Highly recommend, would not disappoint.",
            "Just returned from a 2 night stay here. Rooms were small - basically just the bed and no room for much else. The beds themselves were comfortable,however, and the rooms were clean. Two of us had rooms on the ground floor and found the noise from reception annoying - the noise seemed to travel along the corridor so clearly it felt as though someone was right outside your room. Also got woken by a banging noise which seemed to be coming from the heating system or pipes. Staff were helpful, friendly and accommodating which redeems this hotel somewhat. Nice hotel but we wouldn't opt to stay here again.",
            "The location is convenient for sightseeing - you can get any of most interesting places on foot, the staff is very helpful and friendly. Disadvantage - breakfast is very expensive, although there is a variety of good meal and drinks. Walls and doors are not sound protected, so if someone talks loudly in the floor hall you can be disturbed and even woken up.",
            "We visited this hotel in late March, and found it to be really agreable. It is in a perfect location - tram stops are a few minutes walk from it in either direction - to Leidseplein or the Dam and all other tourist attractions in between. Or if the weather is nice (it was freeezing last week) you can easily walk to everywhere. Hotel staff were pleasant and helpful, the room was a decent size, with comfortable beds, tv, mini bar, and large shower room. Breaksfast room/Bar was a decent size. Can't fault the hotel at all really.. would throuoghly recommend as it is very comfortable. In a good location, but also benefits from being in a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle. Would thoroughly recommend. Enjoy your stay.",
            "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. It is in a pretty and peaceful location, but within easy walking distance of restaurants and centre. The rooms were clean and modern, but quite small. It was necessary to pay extra for the tea and coffee facilities by the day, which seemed incredibly mean. The room was clean, the bed was reasonably comfortable. There's a kindergarten just outside so there's a little noise at times but at weekends very quiet. One downside was at about 2-5am the pipes for the hotels central heating fires up and you hear constant noise in the rooms from radiator pipes (even if the radiator is switched off).",
            "I am a Favorite Guest Business program member which had pre-paid our stay but entered the wrong A Club number. When I arrived, I asked to have the discount applied and enter to the correct Business card number. The hotel manager refused to give the program discount. This hotel management has a poor attitude toward the customer and it appears the management at this hotel is just looking for excuses not to give you the discount. This same situation happened to me at another Accor hotel and that hotel manager was more than happy to provide the discount. Beware of typos when enter your A Club loyalty number when booking this hotel.",
            "This hotel is well situated in a quiet street. The building is a restored townhouse, and the room was comfortable and clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Free wi-fi is available and works well. I would recommend this hotel to business travellers and tourists.",
            "Stayed in this hotel for 6 nights on a business trip. The rooms are small but very stylishly decorated and with good modern bathrooms and very comfy beds and pillows. The hotel is situated on a quiet residential street which means you get a good nights sleep. However, you're not far from all the sights and it's a very pleasant stroll along some of the prettiest canals to Rebrandtplein and the city centre. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice and good freshly squeezed orange juice. The hotel bar is pricey, but nice for a drink before heading out of an evening. Staff were very helpful with restaurant recommendations and travel tips. I'll be back!",
            "Good, clean room. Clean hotel. EXCELLENT staff was Incredibly helpful from the beginning of my stay until the end. Free wifi in the lobby and in the room (you can use it on your handheld device and laptop w/same free code unlike some hotels who act like wifi is sacred.....it's 2011 and wifi THROUGHOUT THE HOTEL AND IN THE ROOMS should be free. This hotel understands that!). Room is not huge but not terribly small either. If you want to be a few blocks from the heart of the action this is an excellent choice. You're probably 100 yards from the tram stop, a block or so from a grocery store and even closer to a few pubs and restaurants. I stayed in room 120 (first floor no elevator required). GOOD SELECTION. I will definitely stay here again if I'm in Amsterdam. I was freaked out that it may be a mediocre hotel since people bash hotels for silly reasons, however if you need a nice, clean, reliable hotel in a good location this is your best bet. I'd love for it to have been less expensive but w/the way people talk about cleanliness, mice, etc. in other less expensive hotels there's NO WAY I'd take that risk. Thanks for an awesome stay.",
            "Have just returned from a great stay at this hotel. Arrived early at the hotel and our room was not ready. Reception kindly looked after our luggage whilst we went to explore the area. The hotel is set just off the main city centre but all areas of interest are within walking distance. We were impressed with our room. Very comfortable bed and good shower. Breakfast, which was included in our package price, was exceptional. Freshly squeezed orange juice, cereals, cheeses, hams, pates, fresh fruit, all kinds of fresh bread as well as scrambled eggs and bacon. You could also order freshly cooked fried eggs if you preferred. Being English, I do like tea/coffee facilities in the room which are not provided. However, you could book this facility for 5 Euros a day, which is very good value when a cup of coffee averages 3 Euros in local cafes. Overall, a great stay in a very comfortable hotel with friendly staff. Would definitely stay again if returning to Amsterdam.",
            "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. It is in a pretty and peaceful location, but within easy walking distance of restaurants. The rooms were clean and modern, but quite small. It was necessary to pay extra for the tea and coffee facilities by the day, which seemed incredibly mean. Parking was very expensive, but at least there was some available. We didn't really have any choice but to pay it as the street parking was also expensive and I never saw a spare space. We were told of the charges on arrival, so it wasn't a surprise. We ate breakfast at the hotel on the last morning of our stay. There were two price choices, express which was 8 euros and eaten in the bar or the full breakfast for 16 euros and eaten in the restaurant. I would not say that either of these options were good value for money, but Amsterdam did seem particulalrly expensive compared with others I have visited. In summary, I would recommend the quality of the hotel, but be prepared to pay for it.",
            "great Hotel, good quiet location, easy walking to Rijksmuseum, van gogh and lots of others. good breakfast, lots of buffet food. GOOD location, quietness, rooms layout. BAD No lift at street level, so some stairs to carry suitcases. highly recommended to stay in, will defenately go back.",
            "I stayed at the Mercure Arthur Frommer this summer and the temperature went up to tropical hights. It was hell at night altough they claim to have airconditioning. The barman was smelly and was asking for a tip! Brutally! To make things even worse: the night porter was drunk!! I complained to the manager but she tried to blame me!! Never, never, never stay at this hotel",
            "Our room was on the 3rd floor, and had a sloping roof, affecting one side of the bed making it hard to get in and out. Staff were generally ok, except the cleaning staff who ignored the do-not-disturb sign on our room, and chose to make it up anyway. We didn't want it made up, we wanted out privacy. We were out of the hotel at the time but that's hardly the point. The colour scheme of the room was a sort of lime green and a pinky colour. Sort of odd really. Location-wise, the hotel is in a nice, quiet location that seems very residential. It's close to Leidensplan, with lots and lots of restaurants, things to see and do. It's a bit of a walk from the Red Light district, but you could always get a tram. We were very upset to discover that for the rate we pay for an Accor 4 star-hotel, there was no in-room coffee facilities. A sign in the lift kindly offered it to us for 5EUR a night. That';s not reasonable at a hotel of this level.",
            "What a great hotel. Situated in a very quiet residential street within easy walking distance of most of the major tourist sites in Central Amsterdam. The welcome at reception was very warm and amusing (being told the room was the only one where it is advisable not to be drunk upon entry!). The room was immaculate and very comfortable but a little cold to begin with due to the heating not having been switched on, but this was soon rectified. The bar is very pleasant and spent a very agreeable late Saturday evening in the company of the barman and a Norwegian engineer. The tranquility is marvellous compared to some other Amsterdam city centre hotels I have stayed in. I will definitely use this hotel in future.",
            "I spent 3 nights and is just great. Nice location, in the nicest part of the town with beautiful canals. I took a privileged room are just restored so everything is new and confortable. Very nice decoration, good breakfast. It was all great. Friendly service. 5 min walk to rembrandt plain.",
            "I stayed here for two nights with two girlfriends - they even managed to find us a room with three single beds! Spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated and with staff that really couldn't do enough to assist. The bar was lovely. The beds were really comfortable and although we were at the front of the hotel, we were not disturbed by noise even though we slept with the window open. The hotel is in a lovely quiet spot but within easy walking distance of the canals, shops etc. Our only small negative comment would be that there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room (although available from room service). I would definitely return, as would my friends. A truly welcoming place to rest your head whilst enjoying the beautiful city of Amsterdam.",
            "Amsterdam is a beautiful city, hotel was perfect location, very quiet,wonderful breakfasts, really well managed, its a pleasant walk to all sights, flower market very close. felt very safe, did boat trip and really enjoyed it, gives you a great feel for the city. Alot to do and see, so will definately return.",
            "Spotlessly clean,very comfortable bed and really nice staff.If you stay here you will most likely use the trams a lot so you should get a 24hr pass (7 euro) as it is 2euro60 every time you ride. You can also get a 48hr but you have to go to the station for this. Take a look at the little voucher stand in the lobby as we got discount on a few things with these including the beautiful museum of bags and purses. The bar is very nice and we went there a couple of nights, the staff where very good. Didnt have breakfast as it was 17euro and there are too many other options nearby. We tried the 1euro breakfast at the HEMA store and it really was great value. Apart from an issue with noisy heating we couldn,t fault this hotel .",
            "Just stayed for 3 nights with 6 friends & found the hotel to be better than expacted. Having stayed in a few Mercure hotels (generally on cheap & cheerful breaks) we found the hotel to be better than expected. The staff were friendly, rooms smallish but clean (cleaned every day) & the continental breakfast more than adequate (with exceptional fresh orange juice - a machine squuzed them freshly as required). The location was down a quiet side street but near enough for \"hitting the town\", with good tram links although close enough for walking. One exceptional point was that I managed to leave some cash in the room safe & only remembered after checking out! However, they had it safely kept in reception. It is also near (only 50 yards from) a very good \"local\" steak restaurant Steakhouse Piet de Leeuw.",
            "With Mercure you can be confident of a nice, clean room with free internet and excellent breakfast. There's some construction outside the hotel, which made it a bit noisy (but no fault of the hotel). The site was accomodating and professional. The rooms are good for the rates charged and the furniture is comfortable. English TV is an added bonus. The location is within walking distance of the city centre but situated in a quiet setting, away from the noise and stress of downtown.",
            "Actually I liked the location, on a quiet residencial street, and liked the style of building. But the good part stops here... I hated the room decoration. The first room I occupied had a brown and blue painting, very dark and tight. Never felt so bad in a hotel room. Internet connection didn't worked with cable, and wireless was T-Mobile, wich I could not use because don't had a T-Mobile phone and could not use credit card for paying the service due to company policies. I finished using the desktop PC near the frontdesk... After complaining about internet I tried another room where the connection still didn't worked but I could get free access from a hotspot and the room was better, with more space and \"lighter\" green paint. The building itself is charmy, with the help of a good IT pro for fixing the internet problems and a good decorator or architect to redesign the rooms it can get quite better. At least new carpet and paintings... Meanwhile, I would never get back...",
            "We stayed here for a couple of nights in March 2012. Our room was on the second floor and really quite lovely. Very clean, modern, and stylish. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a huge room, but there was some storage space and a wardrobe, which was ample as there were just the two of us and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have too much luggage. The bed was comfortable and spotless, although a word of warning to anyone who considers themselves to be tall: me and my partner are both on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpetite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 side, but even we found the bed was a bit too short as our toes were hanging over the end of the bed! The bathroom was also really clean and stylish, and the complimentary toiletries were a nice touch. Our room did overlook the building work that was going on next door, so although the view wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wonderful, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disturbed by it in any way. And thankfully, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the problem with noisy pipes that has been reported by other guests! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have breakfast during our stay and so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that, but we did make use of the hotel bar, which was really well designed and has a lovely ambiance. The prices were really reasonable too, compared to other European hotels that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in. All the staff we dealt with were courteous and polite, and more than happy to help us out. We found the location of the hotel to be pretty much perfect for us. It only took about 10 minutes to walk into Dam square in the evenings, yet it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far enough away from the hubbub that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly quiet and peaceful for a city centre hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easily within walking distance of the Rijksmuseum and the Heineken experience, and about a 10 minute tram ride away from Dam Central station and the canal boat piers. So overall, I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a bad word to say about this place! I would recommend it to other travelers as a good base to explore the city, without paying the top prices charged by more centrally based hotels.",
            "We (me, wife and adult daughter) stayed three nights in this hotel in mid-April. We were allocated Room 108 which we suspect normally had two single beds but the management had put in a roll-away bed as well. All the beds were fine and comfortable. Linen was changed for the third night. There were some cobwebs and dust visible on the high picture rail, quite a few marks on the walls (from suitcases?) and grubby paintwork around the light switches. All this made the room look a little worn and shabby. The air conditioner didn't seem to cool the room, just blow air around on what was a temperature record breaking weekend (27C). The clean, bright bathroom was huge with a proper full-size bath tub with over-bath shower. The sink/vanity unit was okay, and the towels were clean, fluffy and changed every day. The free in-room safe was a good asset. The mini-bar was well stocked, but the contents didn't entirely match the printed list. There is no tea/coffee making facility in the room. From previous reviews we elected not to use the expensive hotel breakfast bar but to eat at a small cafe a few hundred meters south of the hotel on the main road - that was fine. The bagel cafe mentioned in reviews looked good. Note that the Persian restaurant (the Teheran) mentioned in previous reviews is now closed and looking very derelict. Staff were helpful in providing maps and calling taxis. Although not in the downtown central area it is generally within walking distance of most tourist sights, and easily accessible using the 16, 24 and 25 trams from/to Centraal Station. The car park is small, max imum 7 or 8 cars. In summary the hotel was perfectly adequate as a place to shower and sleep. We booked through Expedia and paid EUR118 per night (incl taxes). Yes, we'd stay there again.",
            "Stayed 2 nights recently. Hotel in good quiet location easily accessible to most things either on foot or by tram. Rooms nicely refurbished, clean and comfortable although the bed was a bit hard and the room at night was very hot, couldn't really open the window because of noise of people passing by late at night in the courtyard behind our room. We got a good deal which included breakfast which was fine - plenty of choice, but don't expect anything cooked apart from hard boiled eggs. Recommend getting the two day tram pass at the Central Station in the Tourist Information Kiosk and don't panic the queue moves really quickly with their number system! Good idea to go on a guided bus tour first then you can choose which places you want to visit, we ended up missing a couple because we did it on the last day! !",
            "We have just returned from this hotel where we stayed for 5 days. Our room was a bit too small for what we've expected, we kept bumping into furniture around the bed. It was clean, but some things were a bit shabby, like the shower not working well, and the door missing some paint. All in all it was an ok experience. The location is well, some 5 tram stations from the Dam Square, reachable by stroll. Noise in the hotel was a bit of a problem, as well as the window that was a bit old and couldn't close entirely. Staff were ok, but i must point out that the guy working in the bar was extremely rude and unpolite, not wanting to give me a cup of hot water for my medicine at 23:45 saying that he was done with the work (the bar works until midnight) and making all sorts of faces, and gesticulating in a not proper way. We didn't have breakfast so i can't comment on that. Including all, it was a bargain considering the prices in Amsterdam but i really think it could have been much better.",
            "Stayed three nights at the Frommer in September 2011. Being out from the city center and 100+ yards off a busy street, it was amazingly quiet at night. But that 100+ yard walk brought you to a tram stop that could get you into the center in five minutes, and the hotel is closer to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum (and the Cat Museum!) than those nearer the Dam. Breakfast is not cheap at e17.50 but has a great variety, and if you're an early riser, it opens at 6:30. Bed comfy, and what matter more in a hotel. If I return with my wife next year, we will definitely stay here.",
            "Great place to stay, lovely smiley staff, clean rooms, great sleep, no noise at weekends. It is not in the centre of Amsterdam, so consider that if you want to be closer to Dam Square etc. However, it is a short walk from the museums - Gogh etc - and Vondel Park, and is very close to a tram stop on Vijzelstraat that takes you into the city centre proper. We didn't have the breakfast, it seemed pricey to us, but instead ate out every morning.There are several cafes etc nearby and we had breakfast at Vlaamsch Broodhuys, Vijzelstraat 109 - check their website, they sell a huge variety of artisan breads to die for, plus coffees, pastries, croissants, fruit platters etc. We also ate at Myrabelle, Vijzelgracht 1, a lovely pub that does really nice moderately priced food. A great place to stop off at in late afternoon/early evening for an aperitif if you are returning to the hotel. The other place we liked was De Blauwe Hollander, Leidsekruisstraat 28. It serves typical Dutch food at a reasonable price and was packed when we went on Saturday night. It's not fine dining and the food reminded me of British comfort food, which was perhaps why I liked it! It's in the middle of a really lively (in a good way) area.",
            "Fairly quiet location in easily accessed position near Tram routes (less than 5 min walk). Small rooms typical of Amsterdam but spotlessly clean and well appointed. Hotel only does breakfast but this is fresh food, of excellent quality and variety and staff are very attentive and friendly. Do not expect a pool or Spa.",
            "This property was my first stop after an all-night flight. They had a room ready for me at noon when I finally crashed. This property is just about finished with a thorough remodel. My room was great (two single beds is always a surprise to an American!). The bathroom was brand new and clean. The walls and carpet were freshly updated. I would have loved to have stayed here for my entire visit. It's located a block off of a main street, which makes it nice and quiet at night and it's far enough away from the seedy downtown area that you get a feel for the real Amsterdam. A very nice hotel.",
            "I spent two nights at this hotel and I would recommend it for everybody, who wants conquer Amsterdam. The location near Prinsengracht is very good. It's a 15 minutes walk to Dam and Central Station. And there is also a tram station in 3 minutes walking distance. The hotel is cosy, the rooms are very stylish and well appointed. The bathroom is not to big, but enough. The breakfast is adequate to this category of hotel, but a bit expensive (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac 16,50). There are many nice cafes just around the corner where you can get better and cheaper breakfast. The whole hotel as well as the room and bathroom are very clean. The personnel is very friendly and helpful. All in all a very good hotel to a fair price.",
            "Can't believe the two reviews I've just read. Just returned from Mercure Amsterdam (April 04) and it was fine. Staff very courteous, most comfortable large double bed I've ever had in a hotel, clean, etc. Also clean WC and 'wet style' shower. Nice white fluffy towels. Only thing wrong was no tea or coffee making facilities, but they had satellite TV. Hard to find hotel though, when you arrive at airport, train to Amsterdam Central and then Tram 24 or 25. Just ask, ask ask! the natives are friendly. Thoroughly recommended.",
            "Nice hotel, although the decor is a little wild. Nice location, quiet overnight hours. Good restaurants within walking distance. The staff was EXCELLENT. Very professional and courteous. My only complaint is the rooms are tiny. Yet, you could hold a dance in the shower. Why not make the rooms larger? In order to change my mind I had to go out in the hallway...",
            "The hotel is located just south of the centre of Amsterdam and is easily arrived at on Trams 16, 24 or 25 from Centraal station (the stop to get off at is Wetteringcircuit). It appears to be in a very safe area. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the Heineken Experience. The service we received for fantastic. Hans, on the main desk, was particularly helpful. The rooms are cosy but then you are in Amsterdam so you will only be sleeping there. Only two issues with this place - firstly you can only eat in the hotel at Breakfast time - there is no room service or restaurant. The second issue was that Tea and Coffee making facilities are not provided as standard so you are charged \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 per day for a kettle etc.",
            "We found the Mercure because of it's association with Novotel - it exceeded our expectations and was a great value for a family with small children. Great location near the Heineken Experience, beautiful and spacious room, very helpful staff. It's very hard to find a single room for 2 adults and 2 children, but they can accomodate with advanced notice. We made reservations online and got an awesome rate, but didn't know if they'd have a room for 4 until we arrived. Fortunately, a room with 4 twins was open. There was plenty of space, even with all those beds! Breakfast was filling, although their regular dining room was under construction. The only down side was the street noise from below - but that just helped us get up earlier and get on our way.",
            "I chose this hotel because of its location. The staff is polite and helpful, they made sure to make feel wellcome. A thoughtful detail of the hotel also is give a password to the wi-fi with the expiration only in chekout day, don't forcing the gess to every day ask another password. There is a computer and a printer in the louge (the use is free). My room (208) was spacious and clean, the special pillow (3 per person) and the bed were very confortable. The shower has a constant temperature but whitout much pression, just normal, And had no door, so it left the bathroom a little wet. The place is quiet and near every interesting points includ from the train station. from less them 2 blocks you can find a pub, a mini market, a restaurant and a coffshop. the hotel also has a park in open space.",
            "They took a Merc ure chain property and droped in in a quiet, side street location, differentiated it with modern quirky furniture, and created a great hotel experience. If it weren't for the small Mercure Hotel sign, you wouldn't even know the hotel was there. Walking distance to Heineken Experience, Albert Cruyp Market, Museuamplein, and you can walk to Dam Square in about 20 min (or take the 24 tram). Staff pleasant, and I was promplty checked in to a double on the third floor. Room had modern conveniences, including large bath, fridge, flat screen with international channels, and a windw with shutters. Several wifi options are available, with the cheapest being the broadband connection at the desk for 9 euro per 24 hours. There's a small bar downstaris, and a breakfast room which is simple, but ample.",
            "Why do the advertise with a/c when they switch it off at eleven in the evening? When I complained to the night-receptionist I could't understand a word he was saying. I think he comes from Pakistan or something. The general manager did't listen to my complaint she was more interested in her ugly little dog.",
            "The hotel was within walking distance of the whole city; we didn't have to travel by tram except for our arrival and departure. The bed was extremely comfy, the staff very friendly and helpful, the breakfast plentiful (included in our deal), the room small but more than adequate. It was freezing in the city (the canals froze over for the first time in 15 years) but the room was warm and cosy - we didn't experience any of the radiator noises that some other guests mentioned. The bar was a really welcome spot after a day or night out. The wines were very reasonably priced, the staff extremely friendly and the atmosphere very relaxing. Our room backed onto the street where the school/kindergarten was, yet this was absolutely not a problem. The kids started making a noise around 9 am, by which point we were up and about, getting ready for breakfast. Even if we'd been lying in, the kids wouldn't have disturbed us - the noise was very much of a background nature. All in all, I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel to family and friends with no qualms."

Breakfast room was beautifully lit and comfortably large. The breakfast was great too! Only downside is that curtain door to bath does not afford enough privacy if you are traveling with an older child. Ask for a room that has the new decor. We would certainly stay here again.",
            "Rome is one of my favourite cities in Europe and Hotel Adriano played an important role in making my stay a very pleasant one. Its location is excellent, I could walk to all historical sites of Rome, and there are many good restaurants nearby. Staff is friendly with very good recommendations for places to go for shopping and eating. My room was modern and very clean. There were not many international channels on TV, but I did not go to Rome to see TV, so I didn't mind. The lobby is fantastic, with a very warm feeling. Also breakfast is very good. I highly recommend this hotel to someone who wants to experience how the local people live in the center of Rome, without paying a fortune. I will certainly go to Adriano hotel again next time I will be in Rome.",
            "Hotel Adriano is a gem of a hotel. I was really nervous booking as there is so many to hotels to choose from but this hotel had it all. Within walking distanct of all major attractions and a really good breakfast to stay your day off right. The rooms was lovely with a small terrace to relax on with a glass of wine at the end of a long day of sight seeing. Perfect",
            "I stayed at the Hotel Adriano on my arrival to Rome. The driver sent by the hotel to pick me up at the airport was wonderful. He gave me a quick driving tour around the city before taking me to the hotel. The front desk was helpful. The hotel is very elegant. I had a double room in the new wing of the hotel. The rooms are contemporary and spacious for hotels in Rome. I especially like the bathroom layout with the separate shower. Breakfast at the hotel was good with an average selection. I do think the hotel might offer a few more selections. I selected this hotel after reading the other reviews on tripadvisor, but I'm frankly not sure why this hotel has not ranked even higher. The location was really good--near the Pantheon, the Piazza Navone and fantastic cafes. I would definitely stay here again upon returning to Rome.",
            "Hotel Adriano was perfect for a mother and 16 year old daughter. It was located in a super safe part of town, close to gourmet shops, artisan shops, a newspaper store, bakery, dry cleaner. We walked all over town. Walked to St. Peters, the Colosseum. The staff were very gracious. The breakfast was more than we had hoped for given previous reviews. Fresh fruit, yogurt, cornettos, ham and cheese. The room was clean, the bathroom spacious and clean. The beams in the ceiling let you know you are in a building that is 100;s of years old. It was extremely quiet. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",
            "We stayed in Hotel Adriano for four days, and it was wonderful. The hotel had arrangement for us from the airport and we can recoment it. As soon as we arrived and during the hole stay we felt very welcome by the friendly staff. We had a deluxe-room with a big terrace. The room was great, clean, big, very nice decorated and hade good beds. The location is perfect, only two minutes walk from Pantheon and close to all the other sites. We have been to many four and five stars hotel, so why Hotel Adriano have only three stars, I don't understand.",
            "This was a fabulous place to stay. The downstairs public areas are gorgeous...loved the decor. The breakfast was fabulous. My only complaint is that we thought we had reserved an updated room because we reserved a \"deluxe\" vs a \"classic\", but as it turns out, the only updated rooms are the \"Superior\" rooms. Our room was adequate, but small and loud with traffic noise from the street below and would occasionally get a sewer smell through the air conditioner which was not remedied. I would definitely stay here again and get a superior room. The staff was very helpful and friendly and attended to our every need. The location was great. Very central to all major sites...within walking distance of most. The clientele was upscale. I think it is a good value for the room rate.",
            "This is was my second stay at Hotel Adriano; the first one was in October 2009. I had a good experience then, and knew as soon as we planned our wedding in Italy, that we would be staying at Hotel Adriano for our first few days in Rome. The hotel is ideally located, close walking distance to sites. The classic rooms although typically small in size, are clean and bright and have very large bathrooms. Some of our guests stayed in the upgraded rooms, which were large, modern and spacious; only caveat there is that the bathrooms are a bit less than private, and could be a little uncomfortable for some people. What I really like about this hotel is the large lobby area. There was plenty of room for us to meet down there when planning our days/nights. There is also a separate room with a computer and free internet. We also had happy hour drinks at the bar; the little complimentary snacks were a nice touch. We found the staff very helpful in assisting us to coordinate with our guests, who were arriving on different dates and times. The breakfast is more than ample, and the breakfast room itself is large and comfortable. The age or our group ranged from 28 to 65 and we all enjoyed our stay. I don't think you can beat the amenities, the location and the price. While it is not cheap, neither is Rome as a whole!",
            "we were pleasantly surprised!!! this is a 3 star hotel and we have stayed in 4 star hotels in italy that were not as good as the adriano! great location - many sites within walking distance (vatikan, angel's fortress, piazza del popolo, pantheon, spanish steps, fontana di trevi, piazza navona...) great service - helpful staff nice room - newly renovated...but the corners in the shower were not clean... :-(( great breakfast - opulent buffet and very nice restaurant great atmosphere!!! great value!!! we'll be back!!! i can definitely recommend this hotel!! !",
            "First of all the good points: The hotel is in a perfect location to walk to pretty much all the main sights that Rome has to offer. The staff were very friendly and possibly the world's best pizzeria, Pizzeria da Pasquale, is just around the corner. There is also decent free wi-fi. Now the bad points: We stayed in one of the newly renovated deluxe rooms, 322. The room was a bit on the small side but smelt terribly, a combination of mildew and sewage. I've backpacked around Asia and have a strong stomach but the smell actually woke me up one night as it was so strong. Another thing is that if you want to watch tv and don't speak Italian you'll have to pay extra to get additional channels in English and movies etc. My girlfriend also said that the hairdryer was useless and it took her over an hour to dry her hair (apparently this is very important for you ladies!) Another bad point is the buffet breakfast, if you can opt not to pay for this I wouldn't bother. Rock hard bread, cold eggs etc and there didn't appear to be any real system as to what you should be doing. The location really is the draw card for this hotel, otherwise it is quite average. It didn't take away our enjoyment of the city, which we loved, but for the price (certainly not cheap) I would look for something else the next time.",
            "We loved Hotel Adriano. The location of this hotel is the best, we walked EVERYWHERE in Rome. We stayed in a Double Deluxe room and it was definitely worth the upgrade. Our bed was clean and cozy, the bathroom was completely updated and large. The entire room was huge! We were in Italy for two weeks with two huge suitcases that didn't fit in our Florence Hotel. We had plenty of room at Hotel Adriano. The room was quiet (although not quiet enough to sleep with the windows open, but I\"m not sure if such a place exists in Rome). A full breakfast is available each day and is a good way to start the day. It's not going to be the best meal you have in Italy but it's enough to get you going until lunch. There are two negatives. One, the front desk staff is very unfriendly and not very willing to help. Two, there is wireless internet available but you must pay 10 euro a night to use it in your room. If you have a laptop you can pay 5 euro a night and use it in the lobby area. There is one computer for public use but it's slow and not ideal to use. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone going to Rome.",
            "Stayed in this Hotel for 4 nights whilst visiting Rome. What can I say, for us the Hotel was in a perfect location with all the major sights within walking distance. The staff were pleasant and friendly. We stayed in a room with a terrace which was great for relaxing with a glass of wine after a day walking around the wonderful sights of Rome. There was plenty of fresh food to choose from at breakfast.",
            "We have traveled to Rome many times and stayed at different more expensive hotels. Took a chance on this new hotel for an 8 night vacation. We were nervous but now so very pleased we made the change. Hotels location was absolutely fantastic Staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful Breakfast was very good and again staff went out of their way to assist us. Room was very clean not huge but more than adequate Bathroom really big. There was some early morning local noise but after 8am and not offensive. When we mentioned it to staff they een wanted to change our room. FREE INTERNET was an added find. Can not rave enough about this place.",
            "What a find!!! We spent 4 nights in Rome on our honeymoon and were lucky enough to choose Hotel Adriano. We had a deluxe room with a huge balcony overlooking the charming Roman rooftops. Despite arriving very early in the morning we were able to check into our room immediately. The room was a great size for European standards and due to the recent renovations everything was brand new. Yes the bathroom door was frosted glass and semi see-through but that is the only negative thing I could say and I have high standards. The location was PERFECT only a few blocks from the Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona and the Pantheon with the Trevi only a couple more. The staff were incredibly friendly, particularly one gentleman who was very sympathetic one day when I was very unwell after traveling all the way from Australia. The complimentary breakfast was also great with everything you could possible want and more. My family and friends will all be choosing Hotel Adriano following our glowing recommendation as will we when we return. Hopefully in the not to distant future.",
            "I give this hotel five out of five stars. The breakfast included was sumptuous, seven to ten a.m. The main desk is very helpful in getting you to your destination, either with directions or providing a taxi. The street is one way and smaller than the major streets, so the traffic is not as heavy.",
            "There is no more centrally located hotel in Rome. I'm in my fifties, and was able to walk to everything. The public areas are absolutely gorgeous, but the guestrooms a little more ordinary. But more importantly, the air conditioning worked well, the shower worked well and it was a comfortable room. The desk clerks are a bit shy and withdrawn, as they do not speak English well, but that didn't seem to present any major problems. The wireless internet worked perfectly in the lobby only, but that was good enough for us. We'd sit in the lobby with a drink and our laptops. They do have a bar, but not a restaurant. The breakfast buffet was not as good as the ones we'd had in Venice and Florence, but was sufficient. If I go back to Rome, I would definately stay here again, just for it's location alone.",
            "The hotel itself has nothing special but its location couldn\u00b4t be better. It\u00b4s within walking distance to the most famous sites in Rome. Professional service. We didn\u00b4t use the parking but were offered to. Breakfast was very good, too. We stayed there in the beginning and the end of the trip and in the second time we got a surprising upgrade concerning the rooms which pleased us a lot.",
            "Very nice hotel within walking distance of 90% of the major sites. We had a very comfortable stay at the Adriano. I would stay here again next time I visit Rome. We stayed here at the beinning and end of our trip. The rooms we had were modern and seemed pretty new. As some of the other reviews had mentioned some of the bathrooms do have glass doors but we asked to be in another room before we got there and didn't have a problem. If they are booked solid they may have trouble switching at the last minute so make sure you make that request before you get there.",
            "Great location, close to everything 15 minutes to most sights. Beautifully appointed Hotel with extremely helpful staff. Will definitely return, have stayed the last 2 times I have been in Rome and fell in love with the hotel, rooms, and above all staff. Excellent nearby restaurants, cafes and bars. All my requests have been met with a smile and courteous response! Many thanks to Bernardo at reception and Davide and Issam at the bar, great service always.",
            "Stayed there only this month and was impressed by the d\u00e9cor. Unfortunately my room was facing the front of the hotel and right above a loose drain cover. Every vehicle that went over it caused it to make a loud bang and kept me awake all night. Fortunately the beds are very comfortable but the noise was very bad because of the drain cover. The double glazing does little to stop the noise. I changed rooms the next day and was put in the one next to it. If staying here ask for a courtyard room and not one on the road. The rooms were clean to look at but there was a pubic hair in the bed sheets. Not nice! There was no bath in my room but the shower was good with plenty of hot water and pressure. The sink did not drain well and would be half full after just washing hands. breakfast was in general quite good but on the last day, a Sunday, the juice had been watered down, this was a shame as the blood red orange juice had been nice during the week. I was also booked in for a business fee and went to pay on the Sunday to see they wanted to charge me 32EUROs more than had been agreed in the email. Luckily I had a print out of the email with me so got the price agreed. This mistake also happened to my colleague I was travelling with but who had left a few days earlier, both bookings were made at the same time. The hotel was kind and looked after my bag for me on the last day. Also it was misleading, I felt, but the hotel does NOT have free wi-fi it is 10 EURO/day to have internet in your room. Mixed bag of feelings towards this hotel",
            "The location was perfect, we walked EVERYWHERE. Our room was one of the newer contemporary rooms. The room was attractive and comfortable. We slept very well. The breakfast was included and delicious. The even made us cappucino at no additional charge. they have a small bar, which is great for nightcaps. Front desk spoke English, which was very helpful for us. They also had great suggestions for dinner. We loved everything they recommended.",
            "Rome was the last stop on our tour of Italy, and after staying in 2 fantastic hotels in Venice and Florence we were disappointed when we arrived here. The lobby and bar area are lovely, but when we got to our room it was tiny!! Also, the walls are paper thin and we were disturbed everytime the guests upstairs had a shower and woken up by the people next door who were chatting at 5.30am! The location is excellent with major attractions just a few minutes away, but if you're looking for a peaceful retreat after a day of sightseeing you won't find it here.",
            "My husband and I took a trip to Rome July 2010. After extensively researching hotels in the area we decided on the Hotel Adriano. First of all the hotel is in an excellent location! its within walking distance to Piazza Navona (our favorite piazza of all), a 10 minute walk to the Pantheon, 25 minute walk to the Vatican, and 15 minute walk to the Colloseum. The hotel itself is very nice and clean. Our room was small but I think all European hotels are. The room was very clean and well-kept. The bathroom was cute and up-to-date and actually pretty spacious. The hotel staff was fairly friendly and the concierge got us cabs swiftly and was there to offer advice on restaurants ,shopping, etc. The breakfast was good (ham, eggs, rolls, cheese, croissants, fruit, etc). We would usually wake up, eat a quick breakfast in their lovely breakfast room, and head out on our day of sightseeing. Overall this was a great hotel due to its location, breakfast, and clean comfortable rooms. I am planning on taking my parents with us to Rome on our next trip and will def stay at Hotel Adriano again.",
            "We stayed for 3 nights in a double standard. Had a balcony to our surprise. Staff was great. Location outstanding. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. Loved the blood-red OJ from sicily. Hotel felt safe. Newly renovated. Room and bathroom size pretty good. Larger than expected for Europe. Although shower was small but that's everywhere. Definitley would stay there again.",
            "The best thing about this hotel is undoubtedly its central location, being just a few minutes' walk from Piazza della Rotonda and Piazza Navona. However, unlike some other reviewers, we also found it very comfortable. The public rooms are embellished with fascinating and eclectic decorative touches - ranging from porcelain artichokes to miniature dressmakers' dummies. Our bedroom was more functional than decorative but perfectly acceptable, with plenty of room, a comfortable bed and air-conditioning. The bathroom was a little cramped but , again, perfectly acceptable. We were lucky to have a room facing inwards, onto a small courtyard/lightwell - no view, but no traffic noise either, which is a huge bonus in central Rome! The only complaint we had was that the breakfast room was too small for the number of guests, resulting in queues, and the staff were not as proactive as they might have been in clearing tables and replenishing items which had run out (it was all self-service.) We would happily stay in this hotel again if we revisit Rome.",
            "I was not looking forward to Rome as to the other places we had booked in Italia. But, oh my, my daughter and I had a wonderful time! It is easy to get lost walking around but not matter.....take your map with you and any number of policeman or other people have no problem directing you. The hotel was in a fantastic location and we could walk to almost everywhere and took the bus to some other spots such as the Coliseum. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly and helped call taxis or locate the correct bus route. I strongly recommend the 1/2 day tour of the Vatican as there is so much to see and Sergio explained many details I would have missed. We also went to a lovely outdoor jazz concert in the park at Villa Celimontana, the best kept secret in Rome! We could listen along with a bottle of wine and even order some food. So much to see in this wonderful town and we did find some great deals on fashion!! We did get a taxi to/from the hotel for ease. The train is so doable even though a bit confusing at times but I recommend reservations in advance and in 1st class for a little more. What a great country and we loved every bit of our trip to Venice, Florence, Monterosso and then Rome. What a way to spend time with my 21 yr old daughter!",
            "stayed for 4 nights the beginning of March 2012. Had a triple room which seemed like a double room with some sort of very hard mattress stuck in the corner but OK. Room and bathroom were clean enough but had a problem with the floor always having huge dustballs all over the place, but the bathroom was clean and new. Even though we made reservations last August we did not get updated to A newer room. Breakfast was OK but was included with our room price so not much complaining on that part, but have had better at other hotels. Although living in the USA breakfast buffets tend to be huge. Liked the location seemed very convenient to lots of things, the staff was very nice and overall a very pleasant experience.",
            "The hotel is located centrally in Old Rome, near the Pantheon and Piazza Navona, and is in easy walking distance of many of Rome's favorite tourist sites. Also has excellent access to public transportation with a bus stop nearby and a bus depot a short walk away at Piazza San Silvestro. Rooms are tastefully appointed and impeccably clean. Breakfast is typical. Concierge service is friendly and efficient. A good find for sightseeing in Old Rome.",
            "I really loved this Hotel and the location! I felt it was the perfect location so we could leave the hotel at night to walk around. It was very romantic! The tour buses were blocks away, and of course we did the whole tour. Service was great! Staff was very pleasant and helpful with maps and directions. Breakfast was included in our stay. We had to go downstairs to the lobby in order to use the WIFI internet.",
            "I just returned from a vacation in Rome. I spent 10 days at the Hotel Adriano, from September 18 to September 28th and I absolutely loved it. I was travelling alone so the proximity to just everything was quite appreciated (5 to 15 minutes from Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, Pantheon and other must-see sites). The hotel is lovely and the breakfast was so much better than I expected with a variety of breads, cereals, yogurts, croissants, eggs, juices, coffee... The staff was kind and helpful also. My room was perfect and I was never heard a noise (walking 5 to 8 hours a day will really knock you out at night). When I return to Rome I will definitely stay there again. I chose this hotel because of the fabulous comments I had read on Trip Advisor and I am so glad I did. Thank you Hotel Adriano for making my stay in Rome a pleasurable one!! Isabelle C.",
            "Adriano is in a great central location and has interesting, quite funky decor in public areas. Room was good size for Europe - had a 'modern' one with terrace which was lovely, and a good size up to date bathroom. Breakfast was good and as well as the usual continental fare had scrambled egg and bacon. Reception staff were friendly and spoke good English and gave good local restaurant recommendation.",
            "This was my fourth hotel on a tour of Euorpe and id did not dissapoint. The hotel is in an ideal location to all of the main attractions, within 10 minute walk to Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon and 20 minutes walk to Colesium and Roman Forum areas. The hotel staf was Outstanding, highlighted by Elanora, she was so helpful and freiendly. She was very informative and helped me plan a couple side trips as well as point out some GREAT places to eat. It is a smaller quaint botique hotel, but with all of the ammenities that you would want. Breakfast was good with fresh pastires, eggs, and cereals. My room was slightly on the small side but just right for a single, the double rooms are much larger. If you want a nice, clean, updated hotel with a pleasant professional staff in a great location look no further. Magnifico! !",
            "This hotel was in a great location in Rome. We were in close walking distance of all the sites while still being in a nice quiet neighbourhood close to lots of shops and restaurants. The breakfast was great and included in the price. The rooms were a little small and the shower was European style and wasn't fully glassed in so we soaked the floor every day. The room was clean, however, as was the bathroom and the rest of the hotel. The decor in the hotel was modern and nice. Overall this was a great hotel for a great price.",
            "Best location. Quaint, cozy and clean. Sylvia was a great help and most kind. Stayed 5nights w/terrace room. One note for the terrace, the chair and chaise are stylish but not comfy. Still, it worked for having some vino and chilling while getting fresh air. Left windows open at night for the fresh are and to hear the church bells. Little to no car noise at all. Simply wonderful. Thank you Sylvia!!! !",
            "Hotel Adriano was a great find in Rome. I stayed at the hotel the last 3 days and i enjoyed each of them. Good rooms, with big, clean bathrooms. Loved and really enjoyed the lobby area. it has different cozy areas, but we enjoyed the one with the computer, from which we could connect freely to the internet every time we liked the breakfast was good, with variety of choices and the recepsionist friendly and always happy to help and the best Pro. THE LOCATION which could not be better walking distance to every major attraction in rome. it took u 15 minutes to the vatican, 20 to the colosseum (by foot) and via del corso just 5 minutes away from which you can easily reach everything else near the hotel you can also find some pleasent hotels, and giolittii, to taste whats called the best ice cream in rome (and really was)",
            "We were anxious about booking a hotel at the last minute but found it very easy to book this hotel through their own website. We stayed in a deluxe room which was very clean and comfortable...and the kingsize double bed was greatly appreciated. Buffet breakfast was great with lots of choices for both of us and Coeliac friendly for me which can be difficult at times. Carlo confirmed at the time of booking that their would be suitable food for me and that a pharmacy was located across the street if I need supplies of gluten free breads and things...it was great to know that the hotel staff knew what 'gluten free' would involve. The location of the hotel couldn't have been better - 20mins from the Vatican and 10mins from the Spanish Steps...this was very central for us on our first trip to Rome so we were within walking distance of most sites and places we wanted to visit. I would highly recommned this hotel...",
            "Funnily enough, I booked this hotel after reading through heaps of reviews and not finding any negative feedback (granted, this was 1 year ago and it has taken me a while to wrie this). The cabride was interesting, the initial impression being that this hotel was in a diificult (read: maze) location. The reception looked good and I even saw some businessmen around - hence, great first impression. Then the room.. well I have been to Europe 4 times and stayed in some crap rooms but my goodness for the price (not high, but not low), it was terrible. Yes it was small but one expects that in Rome. But we did not expect the broken toilet, the non-existent hot shower, the ineffective air con, the broken door on the wardrobe which fell on us and the incredibly rude staff (how dare I ask for another room or for working amenities!!). I understand there are 2 separate parts of this hotel - one for Italian businessmen which is apparently nice and more modern (see the photos they use to promote the place) then the other side comprising the majority which were like our room. Being peak season I made the slly mistake of prepaying in full on-line - never again. The one good thing was the tip to use the free walking tours that start at 9 at the Spanish Steps - great guys and alternative spin - do the Ancient Rome tour, not the Vatican one.",
            "Room good - only a small issue the bath plug does not release as it should. Breakfast room very nice & relaxing - only a small issue lion statue hidden low down behind a table would be good to see in a more prominent position. Only real weakness about the breakfast was a lack of good quality Orange juice. Would also suggest a card on each table letting guests know that a coffee/ Capuciona can be requested as many guests will have missed out on the beautifull fresh drink. Many open spaces with a variety of art - some good, some not so good but a wonderfull relaxing setting. 15 Euros for a return trip on a coach from Fiumincino airport to and from Paizza Cavour - 20 to 30 minute walk to hotel. Only 1 computer to access the internet in a room near reception and this was not there one morning. Improvement and at a small cost would be to have 2 computers in this room. All in all though a very good hotel in a perfect location. Please remove all photos of roof terrace as I do not wish to see pictures of what is not available to guests.",
            "The Hotel Adriano provided us with a good central location for Rome\u2019s hot spots. The room was reasonably clean and the bathroom was OK with a good shower/wetroom. Very noisy at night outside the bedroom windows with the constant buzz and rattle of scooters racing up and down the street. Air conditioning worked well. TV good though remote didn\u2019t work. One bedside lamp not working. Fridge in room healthily stocked with tempting drinks etc. Didn't touch them though. We were warned not to put our own stuff in the fridge or it would be confiscated! Why? How would it harm them? Breakfast was hit and miss. Served from 7 \u2013 10am, if you didn\u2019t get there at 7 on the dot there was not much left in the way of hot coffee or strawberry yoghurt. Egg boiler rather a complex gadget. Toaster/grill a bit daunting too. Tables were layed fresh every morning but we often had to use one which an earlier bird had left crumb-covered and which had not been re-layed. Hotel reception a bit reserved. We asked if we could put our passports in the hotel safe and were told we could but it would mean the concierge would have to \"walk all the way over to the other side of the hotel with us to do so\" so we didn't bother the poor fellow. We got the feeling that we were something of a nuisance just being there. Even leaving room key for the day was a bit much for them. (Actually, one concierge in particular who had more than a touch of Ming the Merciless about him). On leaving, while he obligingly called us a cab to get to the station, there was no goodbye as we wheeled our cases out of the foyer, Ming carefully keeping his haughty gaze averted. Rome was fantastic and can\u2019t wait to go back again. We were warned about muggings, pickpockets and gangs of street kids but we saw none of this. Only great style and friendliness and great tolerance of tourists. But will not stay at Hotel Adriano again.",
            "Even though we are sure that the hotel is placed in a hidden street (like in Harry Potter) it is the perfect place to live if you want to be able to take a evening stroll around Piazza Novona or see the Pantehon at night. The room was nice and clean and breakfast was good. The staff was helpful and the only thing bad to say, is that their internet connection was a bit unstable in your room. But all in all a very good stay at hotel Adriano.",
            "My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Adriano on three separate trips to Rome. Our first two trips were in 2006 and our reviews of the hotel were excellent. After our more recent stay in 2008, we will not be returning to this hotel should we find ourselves in Rome in the future. The hotel has a great location but the unfriendly staff and unclean rooms are not what one would expect for this level of hotel.",
            "The hotel is in a fantastic location, walking distance to majority of sights and shops, had to get a cab to the Vatican but was only 7 euros. We arrived and were given a pretty poor room which had a crack in the shower base and a handle on cupboard missing, wiring was taped together and pretty dusty with a stain on the bed cover. We complained and were given a better room, it was probably one of the older rooms as they are refurbing the building. The new room we got was very good and breakfast in the hotel was ok but we only had it once as we preferred to get in the fresh air and try the local places. Really a great city to visit and seemed very safe.",
            "This is a great hotel which makes it really easy to explore all of Rome's main sites by foot. There are lots of good eating places nearby too. We stayed in the new part of the hotel and the rooms were good. The front office staff were really helpful too when we wanted to book stuff. Would definitely recommend it.",
            "Life is too short to be wasting time wondering where to stay while you\u00b4re in Rome! We just arrived home after 5 nights at the Hotel Adriano, and it was our second visit there. To us, the hotel is the perfect hotel if you are going to Rome on holiday. It is situated right in the old town centre, and within walking distance of the Colosseum, Forum Romanum, Pantheon, the Vatican city (St.Peter\u00b4s Basilika and the Vatican museum), the Castel Sant Angelo and all the other hundreds of sites to visit. Apart from a very near perfect location, the hotel itself is fantastic. The staff is friendly and helpful, it is also a very elegant hotel with a quiet atmosphere, and it\u00b4s clean! The breakfast buffet contains everything you could be asking for - all in all just the perfect place! !",
            "The Adriano is a wonderful small hotel in Rome. We spent four nights there recently and found the experience flawless. Our room was modern and spacious (do be careful in registering because some rooms are very small and really meant for a single person). It's located in a nice neighborhood that's not far from the major tourist sites but not full of tourists. The Pantheon is a short walk as our Trevi, Spanish Steps, etc. The staff were very helpful in calling cabs, making reservations, etc. Breakfast room is bit bustling and crowded first thing in the morning but everyone is very understanding. A strong recommendation and we will certainly stay there again if we're in Rome.",
            "Posh looking tiny room at first look. Requested plug adapter 3 times and was told, \"not available\" so I walked down the street and bought one. Used usb plug until then and when turned the screen a bit to add cable, was greeted with Santa Claus beard-like dust on back of screen. The attitude toward guests is \"give me your money and go away\" much different than other Italian experiences. (Stayed is a much cheaper hotel in Florence--much larger room, not posh decorating--Hotel Casci--with a host of adapters, terrifically friendly, and spotlessly clean.) Breakfast at Adriano was good but same type of less than friendly attitude--when a lady accidentily ran into me and spilled my juice, we cleaned it up as the waitresses mysteriously vanished. Having worked in hospitality, the coldness was off-putting and the helpfulness totally lacking. Won't stay again even for the cool looking mini-room.",
            "We stayed here for the 3 days we were in Rome. My husband and I were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go from our hotel! The hotel staff was very helpful with our questions: tours, places to eat, getting a taxi to the airport, etc. Each morning (free) breakfast (pastries, eggs, fruit, toast, cereal, yogurt) was held in the breakfast room - it was decent and provided a great start to the day. The rooms were decent, though small in size, and the shower was great with a rain shower option. We would definitely recommend this to friends and family travelling. You had to pay for internet, but there was a computer in the lobby for use that we never had trouble using. We booked well in advance (3+ months) and received a discounted rate, but were treated with the same courtesy as other guests.",
            "Can't say enough about location. The furthest of the main tourist sights is probably the Coliseum and that was maybe a 20 min walk, if that. We didn't have to use the transit system because everything was walkable. Rome is an outdoor sauna in July, so having a well located hotel was great. As for the hotel itself, I'd probably have rated it a three, if not for the location. Nothing bad about it, just nothing memorable. The bathroom had just been relatively recently renovated so it looked nice. But the shower design was poor so it tended to leak a lot. Breakfast buffet was average. Good enough to get you going for the day though. It's on a back street so it was pretty quiet except for the random scooters and cars zipping by. Look both ways before you put your foot out the front door to the street though, as the road is the sidewalk and cars/scooters will literally use every inch of the road. Quite interesting. There's a mozzarella bar in the piazza called obika that was great. Never had mozzarella like that before. Great place for happy hour for sure. Also, if you walk past the two guard booths, to the left there's a great gelato place called giollitti. Or keep going straight down the street and there's one of those 50 flavors gelato place called Della palm that was good too. Avoid the tourist trap restaurants. Best advice I got on restaurants was looking for menus that weren't translated.",
            "Read the reviews on Trip Advisor about the great location for this hotel and they proved to be true. The hotel is within fairly easy walking distance to all the main attractions in Rome. My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in late August. We had booked a Deluxe room based on the hotel website. When we saw the room we were disappointed that although it was good sized the room was not one that had been upgraded. When I asked to move to an upgraded room, the desk attendant said they had none available that night but could move us to a Superior room for the next two nights, which we agreed to. When we got moved, the room had been upgraded, but was much smaller than the original room. In restrospect we probably should have stayed in our original room. The breakfast was very good and the room where it was served was very nice. The rooms were kept clean but some of the bathroom fixtures, even in the upgraded rooms had some mold around the shower area. There was also an odour in our second room, that we could not quite figure out. There were some sented sticks in the bathroom which may have been the source or they might have been placed there to try to cover other odours. I'd consider staying at the Adriano if I return to Rome due to the excellent location but would want to check out the room before checking in to make sure I know what I was getting.",
            "My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights 27th to 30th June. It is very central with all major sights and plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance. The rooms are nice and clean and well looked after and the staff are approachable and helpful. Breakfast was good and plentiful. Our room was a bit noisy - we were on the 2nd floor overlooking the road and you could clearly hear the traffic noise and the clatter of a loose drain cover every time a car went over it. I'd definitely stay there again but would ask for a room on a higher floor or overlooking the central courtyard. Careful on the way out of the hotel too - it is right on the road.",
            "Visited Rome early June 2011 for 2 nights after an amazing week in the southern parts of Italy. Hotel Adriano- Great location without a doubt! Closely located to all tourist attractions. 5 Min walk from the Spanish Steps and same for the Trevi Fountain, 5 Min walk from Piazza Navona and a few more to Trastevere while bus stops for the rest of the attractions are close by. Rooms are smallish but clean, modern and comfortable. The public areas of the hotel are absolutely beautiful and decorated very stylishly. Front desk service is quite average where we felt that help and assistance are available but you have to \u201csqueeze the lemon\u201d to get it which sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable. Breakfast is nice with the normal European buffet table. Price- a bit high in my personal opinion but I guess it\u2019s same for any other place in the area. We will definitely stay again!",
            "A really lovely boutique hotel right in the heart of Rome. With two small children we could easily walk to Piazza Navona, the Trevi fountain, Pantheon and Spanish steps. An area full of restaurants and great for walking. We had a very nicely appointed and quiet family room on the third floor. Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful in advising restaurants, tours etc. Breakfast was simple but well thought out and delicious. I would easily recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a short city break. One good tip I was given before traveling...don't rent a car in Rome! Nowhere to park, small narrow streets and very complicated. Once in Rome you don't need your own car, everything is close by.",
            "This is a lovely hotel with good service, modern, clean rooms with spare modern furniture that is well located near the Piazza Navona. The room was extremely quiet thatnks to very secure windows. It has a great breakfast that is included and the staff was always friendly and helpful. I wold absilutely stay here again and again when i vist Rome.",
            "I was transferred to this hotel for one night having been in H . Fontana. The location and view from the bedroom wasnt quite as extraordinary as H Fontana but the room was very good indeed - much more spacious and better bathroom etc. It was quite spacious as Rome rooms go and had been given a new and most pleasant bathroom . I was impressed with the relative good value for the very decent calibre of room. Breakfast was quite satisfactory in a very acceptable salon. Checkin and Out was fine - no particular comment in terms of staff attitude. I would consider trying this place again if i needed a cheap but well located hotel, although at the end of the day it is lovely to lean out of your bedroom window and have a view to die for ! !",
            "Friendly staff, Clean rooms, Central location we could not have asked for anything better. Although this hotel did not provide evening meals there was no shortage of places to eat nearby. The Piaza Navona was within easy walking distance and was a wonderful place to spend an evening with a wonderful ambiance",
            "As others have said, the location could not be better. We could walk to all the sights of Rome within 30 minutes, and we never needed to catch a taxi or a bus. To get to the hotel from the airport, take the Leonardo Express train ( 30 minute journey ) Metro line A to Spagna ( just three stops ). You arrive at The Spanish Steps which is a great start and the hotel is just 10 minutes walk from there. Perfect ! Our room was at the back of the hotel, and very quiet. Breakfats could have been a bit better, but overall we were very veryu happy with our stay....and Rome was magical. Just watch for food prices before being seated at a touristy restaurant ! !",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Adriano for five nights in December. The room was modern with a great terrace/balcony. The breakfast was great with that strong coffee that you don't find in the US. The area is terrific - close to the shopping, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, etc. We would like to sincerely thank the hotel for their assistance and empathy. We flew to Rome through the snowstorm in Paris and our bags were subsequently lost by Air France. The hotel was generous to let us dial out without charge to track our baggage. Additionally, the very nice woman who helps run some of the hotel and restaurant gave us a very nice Hotel Adriano tote bag in order to pack up some of the new things we needed to pick up to continue on without our personal luggage. Great service. We can't wait to return one day to stay at this hotel.",
            "We stayed in Hotel Adriano for 3 nights in March, the hotel was clean and our Standard Double room was quite spacious. We stayed in the 'new' part of the hotel, so maybe the older parts of the hotel aren't quite so nice? The breakfast in the hotel was very basic - hardly worth getting up for! The breakfast staff didn't seem to know what they were doing (rushing around, failing to turn around tables) - not bad, just not great. Reception staff were very helpful. One thing that did annoy me was when we returned to the hotel early one night (10pm ish), we found the bar closed The location of the hotel is great, we walked everywhere; Pantheon, Vatican, Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, etc.",
            "Great location, can walk to most sites in the city . Relativeley quiet location. Rooms were small ( as in many hotels in Europe for that price) but were clean and comfortable. It is better value than other hotels I have stayed at in Rome for similar prices. I will always stay here in the future when visiting Rome",
            "Stayed 3 nights in perhaps one of the newer rooms. It was spacious (for Rome) and very quiet. Wifi was free in the room. Used the lobby computer to book Vatican tickets in advance, send the confirmation to the front desk, and they printed our receipt for us. As we are independent travelers we did not use the front desk for much, but they were kind enough when approached.",
            "I booked this hotel for my husband and myself after reading the reviews of other travellers to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel I was so pleased with my choice. We arrived at Ciampino Airport and took the shuttle bus to termini station (6 euro each). From there we transferred to our hotel by licensed taxi (18 euro in total). We would recommend this particularly if you arrive at night which we did and although we could have taken the metro to our hotel and then a taxi, we decided that for 18 euro it was worth getting to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel we were very happy with what we saw and I was so excited as the responsibility of booking the hotel was mine!!!. The common areas are absolutely great in fact we would describe the hotel as 4 star rather than 3. Then there was the question of whether the room itself would live up to what we had seen in the lobby and it did. The room was just as pictured on the internet (we booked through yeego.com). Lovely oak floors and matching furniture and good quality furnishings. The shower was a little small but impeccably clean the whole room was clean. The thing that I really liked was that there was a card in the room giving the name of the person who had prepared and cleaned the room and that card was left every day so you knew, if necessary, who to complain about. But we can honsely say there was nothing. One small thing, we had to pay for room service as we like to have breakfast in our room and this costs 5 euro each person but was well worth and excellent serviced. Like all the previous reviews, we would add that the location is absolutely great, trevi fountain, spanish steps, pantheon, colosseum even the vatican all within easy walking distance. Unfortunately we missed the sistine chapel but needless to say we will be going back and staying at the Hotel Adriano!! !",
            "In the very heart of the Centro Storico the hotel's location is exceptional. The rooms are OK and things generally work but there is no real life in the hotel. Breakfast is OK but staff hard to find. Reception team never moves from behind the desk and while they will do things did you, you are never sure if is almost too much effort. A good central position and great if you know Rome, or are ready to get out and discover the best city on the planet. Nearby you find everything, the best coffee, pizza, pasta, wine and tourist must-do's .... So it depends what you want really. At the price and given location and the upgraded rooms etc, I would still likely stay again!",
            "I read some of the earlier reviews from 2003, 2004 that were very negative. The hotel was apparently completly renovated at the end of 2005 and all I can say is that you cannot go wrong with this hotel. The loaction is incredible ... walking distance to every major attraction. The room and public areas were well above average and the breakfast buffet was excellent. I really cannot find anything negative to say about this hotel and I have researched many other hotels in the area. A small elevator that only fits 4 people may be the only negative but unless you are traveling with a large family ... does this even matter. Comfortable beds, good air conditioning, good bathroom. internet connection in room, quite streets, good staff, I could go on and on.",
            "Just five minutes from Piazza Navona and main sites this is the best hotel I have stayed in in Rome. Clean room that was quiet every night, amazing considering its close proximity to the sites. Helpful staff, excellent breakfast, slightly expensive for a five night stay but I suppose you get what you pay for in capital city. Would happily stay again and recommend to couples and small groups of friends for a lovely stay.",
            "We arrived in Rome and walked into this hotel on the chance that they'd have a room available for 2 nights. They said they could accomodate us but would have to move us to a different room for the second night. The first night was wonderful. The room was lovely - very modern and great value for money. The reception and dining room are beautifully designed and feel modern and clean. We couldn't believe our luck! However, on the second day our bags were moved to the new room while we were sightseeing. When we returned, it was as if we'd walked into an alternate universe. This room was filthy with old furniture, damp peeling patches on the walls, worn-out smelly carpet and a mouldy bathroom. Apparently the management ran out of money when they refurbished the hotel and so half of it is gorgeous and modern whilst the rest looks like a squat. We were shown another room in the 'old' section of the hotel, but this was equally awful so we left. A great hotel if you can get an assurance that you'll be in the newly refurbished part. If not, avoid it like the plague!",
            "This is more like a four star than three star hotel. The reception area, little lounges, etc are very tastefully decorated and cosy. The room (double de luxe ) - was spacious, modern, clean with a lovely bathroom and a little balcony overlooking the surrounding rooftops. The breakfast was great for a European hotel. The hotel is situated in a very convenient and central position. Highly recommend this hotel - would stay there next time in Rome without looking elsewhere for any other accommodation.",
            "I have stayed at Hotel Adriano everytime i stayed in Rome for now almost than 10 years, staying each time one week and i have loved it for its ideal central location in the center of Rome. I find the price reasonable considering the location (although hotels in Rome are definitely expensive). During the last two years, the hotel has been refurbished and is now a real three star hotel. For sure, i will go back.",
            "The hotel was best placed for our stay in Rome. The cleanliness of the hotel was good. Room size was in my mind, small. My sons air con was faulty, whilst this resulted in a reduction it shouldn't have happened. Staff were however, very good. I would stay at this hotel again.",
            "My wife and I just returned from a trip to Italy and we stayed at the Adriano in Rome. We would recommend it highly. The location is perfect. The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was excellent. The hotel is really very nice. The room itself was a bit small, but typical of Europe...the bathroom and shower were good, so no complaints about room or noise.",
            "We ended a 9 day vacation with three days in Rome. After visiting Varenna and Vernazza and completely decompressing, we were worried the hustle and bustle of Rome would elevate our stress. But the Hotel Adriano provided a most relaxing environment. The room was spotless (stayed in classic room), the bed comfortable, the A/C most welcomed with Rome temps in the 90's, and most importantly, so quiet!! The staff was very professional, knew your name after check-in, provided perfect directions with maps and were helpful if asked. Good breakfast buffet although you should try all the wonderful establishments around the hotel. The location was fantastic. Easy walks to the Vatican, Spanish Steps, Trevi, etc. The hotel is located near Parliament, so you felt very secure with all the security around. Although, Rome in general felt very safe. My only complaint was the 5Euro daily charge per device for wireless, which adds up when you have 2 phones and a computer. They do offer free wired Internet on a computer in the lobby. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, highly recommend!",
            "Stopped here in June as part of our honeymoon and we loved the hotel. Its not a big hotel but is in a great location with lots of bars and restaurants on the door step and is in an excellent position for sight-seeing during the day with nothing more than a short walk away. The hotel itself was clean and comfortable - we had a room with a balcony and the bathroom was modern and well equipped. Best part was the bar man who was friendly and very helpful with recommendations for bars/places to eat",
            "We have now stayed twice at Hotel Adriano and will stay again. It\u2019s nicely situated just off the Via Della Scrofa in the middle of what would be a triangle formed by the Mausoleum of Augustus, the Piazza Novona and the Pantheon. Like the Grand Hotel Minerva in Florence, it\u2019s something of a business hotel with a bit of design flair. The public rooms are very design conscious with lots of low, cushiony seating and art objects here and there. The two breakfast rooms are nicely furnished with those kind of chairs they dress in cream denim pinafores for banquets. The included breakfast itself is tasty and has a nice variety of selections. Rooms are spare and design oriented having been recently refurbished. Reviews say that the front desk is inadequately staffed and I would have to agree but if you can get over that, the place is a good deal in the middle of Rome.",
            "We just returned from Rome and spent four nights at Hotel Adriano. The location and the value were excellent! There are many restaurants and shops nearby. The night atmosphere was lively and we felt very safe. The location was perfect for walking to all the sights (5 min to Pantheon, 10 to Trevi fountain and Spanish steps, 15 to Roman Forum, and 20 to Colessuem and Vatican). We couldn\u2019t have picked a better spot! The breakfast was included in our stay and was very good with hot and cold options. The room was clean and comfortable. Wi-Fi was free and worked great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My husband and I were extremely pleased with our choice and would definitely stay here again!",
            "This hotel was well located for the things we wanted to do in Rome. We used their airport pickup service and it worked very well. The room and bathroom easily accomodate 3 people. The only down side was the internet access which did not work at all for accessing our e-mails. Staff was friendly and very helpful.",
            "The hotel location was perfect for all aspects of touring the major sites of Rome. Even cab rides to some of the sites were short and easy. The room was in the re-modeled part of the hotel (our request) and was sleek, modern and clean, although small. Their idea of a triple room was to simply add a roll-away bed for my daughter. It was, however, a comfortable little bed! There was a large cushion (really large!) standing up in the corner, for which we never discovered the purpose? The bathroom was very modern, immaculately clean, with a glass door that did little as it was easy to see through. We did find that the room was a bit odd, however, as the shower is actually outside the bathroom, and IN the bedroom. Ours leaked easily around the door, creating a flood on the bedroom floor every time someone took a shower, which judging by the discoloration on the wood floor, had been a regular occurrance. The room also had an odd odor, something we could not identify. I would return, but would ask for a room with the shower IN the bathroom.",
            "The hotel was great. It was in a great location. Prices were reasonable by central Rome standards. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good. The only downside was that the bedspread and the carpet seemed dusty and dirty. Some fingernail clippings were left by a prior guest in the bathroom. The cup in the bathroom appeared to have been used upon our arrival. Not filthy, just not up to top quality cleanliness standards. That said, I would stay here again because I do not believe there is better value to be found in a hotel in central Rome.",
            "We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at the end of our 2 week holiday in Italy in July. We booked a triple superior room with a terrace. The room itself was lovely- modern, new, clean with a great bathroom. The terrace was brilliant, shame it rained on our last day!! The hotel itself was really nice, we had no issues at all except that breakfast was a bit chaotic. On our first morning it was very busy and whilst we were up getting food people had sat at our table. It would be better if there is actually someone supervising things. The location of the hotel in the historical centre was great. Overall I would definitely stay here again. There seem to be some mixed reviews around the rooms, I would pay the extra to get a superior one. It was worth it.",
            "If you are looking for a hotel in the centre of Rome with easy access to all tourist attractions this is the hotel. Maximum walk of 15 minutes to Vatican. Great Hotel with extremely helpful staff. Would definately stay here again. Remember there is a set taxi fare from airport to central Rome of \u20ac40. Don't be fooled by limo (shared taxi) drivers in arrivals. There is a set fair with white taxi to central rome.",
            "We booked a \"double deluxe\" and asked for a modernized room with a balcony. We had the reservation confirmed twice and got the room we wanted (room 422). The room and facilities was modernized in a minimalistic manner. The room was small (like most european hotel rooms) but adequate for two persons with only little baggage. The bed was firm and the pillow a bit hard but, nonetheless, we had excellent sleep. \"The bathroom\" was separated from the sleeping area with only a curtain which was inadequate for securing \"bathroom privacy\". The toilet had a semi-transparant sliding door and the shower had a semi-transparant door. The balcony was large and equipped with a lounger and a chair. Flowers and plants made the balcony nice. Moderate street noice is to be expected in the middle of Rome but it felt like culture more than a problem. The view was uninspiring looking at antennas on neighbour builidings but the sky was clear and the balcony sunny. The hotel seeems to be mostly visited by couples above 30 years and it is quiet and relaxing. However, TV-noice from next door and voices from the corridor is quite evident when they occur (which they rearely did). Breakfast was average. The Hotel Adriano is perfectly located in the old part of Rome with small cobblestoned \"via's\" just outside the door. The hotel is in walking distance from all the major sights from the Vatican to the Colosseum.",
            "This was our first trip to Rome and could have not chosen a better place to stay. Hotel Adriano is located center of all tourist attractions and is within 15-30mins walking distance depending on the site. My husband and I stayed here for 5 days/4 nights during \"Holy Week\" (the week before Easter Sunday), the most busiest time of the year. I am gald we stayed here because initally we were looking into some hotels near the Pantheon and the Trevi Fountain which ended up being loud and overly CROWDED with tourists. Hotel Adriano was secluded from the noise but close enough to walk to the tourist sites from the Colosseum and to the Vatican. A free breakfast buffet was available every morning, however the only one bad thing was that this hotel only served breakfast- no restaurant avail for lunch or dinner, which means you would have to eat out on the town. Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay.",
            "Our third visit to your lovely city and what a pleasant hotel to use as a base. From Hotel Adriano you can walk to all the interesting sights in Rome-no taxi needed. The staff members were very friendly and accommodating. We had two rooms and on arrival one room was not acceptable(bathroom not cleaned). Front desk immediately moved us to another room. Breakfasts were great with a varied fare. Our next visit to Rome will include the Hotel Adriano. Thankyou for a lovely stay.",
            "We stayed here for 3 nights after a cruise. Our family of 10 booked 3 rooms. 2 of the rooms were triples on the 4th floors. These rooms were great. Everything was renovated and hip.. The size of the room were big with very modern bathrooms. One of the rooms had an awesome balcony. The balcony had 2 lounge chairs and pretty flowers. We used it at night. The third room we booked was a double and they put us on the 1st floor. This room was quite old and dingy compared to the rooms on the 4th floor. I don't think the hotel renovated the rooms on the lower flowers. The room felt claustraphobic after a while. It did have high ceilings but was very small. The location of this hotel was awesome. It was walking distance to everything. Extremely convenient. The breakfast was great too. Mostly self serve with great coffee, pastries, fruit etc. I would highly recommend this hotel - great location and rooms (as long as it is not on the first floor...)",
            "I've now stayed here twice, once in Oct 2009 and most recently in May 2011. This is a great hotel for the American traveler - comfortable, clean and familiar. Both times I stayed here was with groups of friends/family for weddings. The communal couches, nightly happy hour and comfortable lobby are great for meeting up with everyone, relaxing, zoning out, etc. The desk folks are somewhat helpful, if not a little grumpy. The location is fantastic - you can walk to many sites from the hotel and the fabulous restaurant Gusto isn just a short walk away. Rooms are expensive, but very clean. I stayed in a double regular which was fine with a great separate bathroom. The next time I stayed in a twin superior, which was gorgeous - except the shower stall was outside the bathroom, in the middle of the room. Not a big deal, but a little awkward for a double twin room. (If you're not sharing a bed with someone, you're probably not comfortable with them showering in the middle of the room!). Working around this wasn't a problem, though. Breakfast is reliable and good. Unfortunately, there's no wi-fi in the rooms; and you have to pay to use it in the lobby. I had a major problem with this - If i'm going to pay ten euro a day to use it, i want to do it from the privacy of my room. They do have a computer station for guests to use free of charge and most guest seems to respect time limits, etc. I personally would prefer a hotel that's a little more traditional; but I'd definitely stay here again -- especially if traveling with multiple generations (they have an elevator! ).",
            "My wife and me stayed in Hotel Adriano for a long weekend in october and loved every minute of it. First of all, the location is great. Walking distance to Piazza Navona and Campo de Fiori and a lot of a sights too. Our room (superior double) wasn't big, but large enough not to trip each other every time we moved. Ned was nice and hard, not like many other hotels, that think the ultimate bed is a soft one. Anyway, fantastic shower too. Tv was crap (no radio channels, just a couple tv channels), but you don't watch tv when the city outside your room is a open air museum. Sure, there was some noise from outside. Scooters on the street, the garbage man in the morning, but with the window shut (and for americans: airco on) most of the noise stays outside. Oh, the breakfast. Wow! Two more excellent things: the bar/restaurant across the street and the farmacy around the corner (to cure that extreme hangover you get when drinking too much prosecco on the first night, like we did). By the way: when in Rome... rent a scooter! It's a fantastic experience that will last you a lifetime.",
            "I had booked this hotel using mileage points for a three-night stay in November. It proved to be in a good location, i.e. a small side street very near Piazza Spagna (subway), Trevi Fountain, and the Pantheon. There is a good bus connection at the hub at Piazza San Silvestre about a 5-minute walk from the hotel. The room was small, but since we were are out most of the day, it did not matter much to us. The room was clean and reasonably quiet, and the view from the window was at air conditioning units and walls. The breakfast buffet was excellent, offering fresh juices, eggs, cheese, ham, fruit, and many more choices. We were impressed by the taxi transfer to Fiumicino Airport, which the hotel arranged for us. It turned out to be a private driver (no official taxi), who got to the hotel ahead of time and took us to Fiumicino on what seemed to be the feastest and most direct route. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful, even tough the reception seemed to be understaffed and a little overwhelmed the night we got there.",
            "The hotel itself was very nice for a very central postion, no complaints except my newly purchased lingeria went missing. The manager very politley told me that \"the staff had been there many years and that guests often said they had lost things when they hadn't\". No signs of a complaints procedure or apology. It was such a shame so beware of walking underwear",
            "When I travel to Rome for business or pleasure Hotel Adriano is my preferred choice. After a major renovation the rooms are very stylish, trendy and very confortable. Stuff is so kind and attentionate to make you feel at home and charming owner Barbara is always there to give you the best tips and ideas to make your journey unforgettable. Central position is so convenient that makes Hotel Adriano close to everything you want to do in Rome from historical monuments visits, shopping and best restaurants.",
            "Just returned from 5 days in Rome. Adriano is in a great location for walking to most attractions BUT our room (123) was tiny. We were falling over one another. No dressing table, one hard chair, very tired bathroom, bedroom needs a makeover generally. When will hotels start giving room sizes in their descriptions. All top show, this hotel. Lounge area very smart. Bar only opened at 6pm!! Breakfast not worth bothering with - typical cheap hotel fayre. Better to spend 3 euros for 2 people on real coffee and croissants!",
            "This hotel is so convenient to all the marvelous sights of central Rome. We could walk everywhere from the Vatican to the Colosseum, and beyond. We enjoyed the evenings in the lobby with a glass of wine. The rooms were small but well equipped. Breakfast each day was excellent with a variety of items served buffet style. I would return here on my next visit to Rome.",
            "We booked this hotel because of the reviews on Trip Advisor, and the photo's of the rooms which look small but clean and the bathrooms look nice, however ours wasn't!!! We had the tiniest bathroom imagineable and the whole bathroom looked like it needed ripping out and replacing. (there was an old mouldy looking radiator in the shower!!!!) The room was tiny but you do expect that in rome.The bar area is lovely and inthe evenings they put loads of complimentary nibbles out which is a nice touch. The Breakfasts are very average but again ok to set you up for the day. The staff were efficient but not particularly friendly. Location is fantastic its literally 2-3 minutes walk from the pantheon and within 20 mins walk to everything else except the colosseum which is about 30 mins. (only 5 euro's in a taxi) We usually always stay in 4-5 star hotels but decided this time we would just go for location as we would hardly be in the hotel and we would spend the money we had saved in Rome, however if I was to return I would upgrade the hotel as the bathroom situation was not pleasant at all and We would have asked to move rooms if we had been staying longer than 2 nights.",
            "This hotel was not our original first choice, but it turned out beautifully. I found the staff to be helpful and spoke great English. The room was much larger than most European rooms, very clean. The location of the hotel was excellent, we could walk everywhere we wanted to go, and it was tucked away in a quiet location. Many of the places we had looked at ended up being in very travelled and noisy locations, and this place is in a much better location. I wish the hotel had free wireless, and that it was avaiable in the room.",
            "Stayed here for 4nts in late July for a midweek break. Arrived on the bus from Ciampino and caught a cab to the hotel, ended up costing about 15 Euro, be careful that you do not take one of the cabs offered by the touts as they might charge you near on double. Checked in without issue, and were shown to a nice twin room on the top floor, the view was nothing to write home about but then again when you go to Rome it isn't to stay in the hotel so this wasn't an issue. Went out and explored straight away, found that the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon and the Trevi Fountain were 5-10 min walks away, and so resolved to go there the next day. Used the hotel to escape the mid afternoon sun, and enjoyed having an hour nap in the afternoon as well. The breakfasts were nothing special, just eggs and meat, croissants etc. The grapefruit juice and red OJ was disappointing, as were the tea facilities. Still, with so many amenities nearby this was not a great issue. The hotel was easy to find, and the staff were friendly. I felt totally safe and would stay there again. We booked through [--] and got a great rate for \u00a3200 for 4nts for the pair of us.",
            "This hotel was a very nice surprise. I usually don't expect much of a 3-star hotel but this was VERY GOOD! Cool interior, fresh and delicate, friendly and helpful stafff, nice room, quiet and perfect location. I thought it was a 4 star hotel. I will stay here next time I go to Rome.",
            "My Fiance booked this hotel in room based on location and trip advisor reviews and we were very happy with our experience here. We arrived at about 9am after a long long flight from San Francisco and were eager to get to our room and catch up on some sleep. I figured they'd hold our luggage and we'd have to wander Rome for a bit until check-in. But happily they were very accommodating and put us in a room for a few hours until ours was ready which was at noon. It's important to note that there is a new wing and an old wing in this hotel. You want to stay in the new wing. The old wing is very old and faces some construction on the building next door. The rooms in the new wing are very very nice and very spacious for European hotels. Modern amenities, great shower and firm beds. We stayed in a deluxe room with a terrace. It was on the top floor and while the views are not fantastic, the terrace is very large and sunny and has a nice lounger and a little table. Location is phenomenal, it's within a very short walk of the trevi fountain the Pantheon. The plaza at the Pantheon is great as well with lots of street entertainers and nice cafes. We were there in early September and the weather was nice. It was hot but not unbearable with some clouds to keep it from baking. We walked to the Colosseum as well as the Vatican from this location. The complimentary breakfast was also very good, although it ends at 10am. The front desk clerks were very helpful and spoke excellent English. I'd definitely stay here again.",
            "We stayed here as part of a longer trip in Italy and found it to be in a great location - close to Pantheon/Piazza Navona/Vatican and, for the money, very suitable to our needs. The room at first seemed small, but had very adequate closet space which helped us make better use of the overall room space. There was a flat screen TV and the bathroom was large and very functional. Breakfast was good and the public rooms including the breakfast room are very nicely done, modern and clean. Overall we had a good experience and would return.",
            "Everything is close to this hotel - sights & shopping! The rooms are modern but yet warm. The hotel bar is really nice with great \"happy hour\" specials. I loved the room service - exactly what I ordered was delivered - this rarely happens! I usually prefer to eat outside (not in the hotel restaurant) but the Adriano has a wonderful daily fresh \"mozzarella di bufala\" menu that is the best!!! I have already told friends and will definately return to the Adriano!! !",
            "We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It was just what were looking for in that it was in a fantastic location within walking distance of all the main attractions, it was clean, tidy, and fairly modern. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was good. Overall it was good value for money and when we return to Rome, we'll be staying at Hotel Adriano again. The only thing to be aware of is that it is a little tricky to find the hotel but you'll be fine if you take a taxi from the airport or if you have a good look at some maps beforehand. It is worth noting that a taxi from Fumincino to the city centre is \u20ac50. This works out better than taking the train from the Airport to Rome and then getting a taxi from the station.",
            "We paid more than 250 Euros/night for a Jacuzzi bedroom and we're really regretting it. Very old bedroom with mold in every corner. Bugs in bed and mosquitos once opening the windows. Strong bad smell once we opened the room, some fixing in the toilet were going on probably. We stayed mostly outside the hotel because of this strong smell. We found a large dirty and wet towel thrown in the tub! It was a shock! The reception and lobby with very nice decorations and design but beware of the rooms, they are totally different. Ask for a room in the new extension - walls with modern design and black color. Some of the receptionist staff were rude. We asked to have our luggage from the storage to check out and the receptionist told us to pick them from the storage!!! How about the other people luggage, why he didn't think about the security of these people luggage?! I went there and I found many luggage there and very difficult to get ours, so I asked the other receptionist and she called the hotel-boy to do so. The reception services must be improved otherwise it'll effect their reputation. The lift is very small. Breakfast was good. Wireless internet not working in our room and I postponed my flight check-in one day till I went to the lobby and I worked near the wireless machine and then it has worked! I stayed in 5 hotels in Italy in 10 days and I've never hate a hotel as much as this hotel because I paid much and I've got nothing!",
            "Did I mention GREAT LOCATION? Given the number of bad reviews on this site, I was reluctant to book, but as the hotel was in the area I wanted, and less expensive than many others, I decided to chance it. I shared a number of emails with Carlo Zoppi, and he assured me that I would have a room that met my needs. I was not disappointed. I was in Room #311, and although spartan (wouild like to see some color on the walls), it was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was quite large by European standards and actually had a bathtub. Julio took me to my room, and apparently, he was also the housekeeper for my room. On the three nights that he attended to my room, it was better than the others (extra attention to details), but still, overall, I was satisfied. The hotel probably needs a few more Julio's, but that might be hard to come by. Breakfast could be better, but the rolls were quite good. Coffee was awful, but I did not find it better elsewhere. I should also mention a very pleasant restaurant within 5-10 minutes walking of hotel. It is \"BEFORE\" at 18 Piazza Nicosia. Not for \"Foodies\", but adequate and well priced. I had the best bruschetta ever, and the maitre de was quite charming. I would definately stay at the Adriano again.",
            "Stayed for 3 nights with wife, hotel is located in a fantastic location.. walkable to all major attractions. Hotel was clean, rooms large and breakfast more than enough. it is 30euro fixed rate from ciampino to inner Rome, we went Terravision coach then taxi , thought we were saving money but worked out more and far less convenient. For a good value base in a fantastic central location well worth it ...when we return to Rome would go back to this hotel. Loved Rome and the Vatican."

            "I know Paris hotels well and this one is an excellent choice if you are looking for a step up from a budget hotel but still want something reasonable. The rooms are very comfortable, clean and the bath is exceptionally nice. The mini-fridge comes in handy when you want to buy cheese! The staff is very helpful. Breakfast is as one would expect -- juice, bread, croissants, cereal and yogurt. The location is ideal. The bus stop is around the corner and the metro stop is a block or two away. You can easily walk to Nortre Dame and stroll through the Latin Quarter. Yet, you are in a neighborhood and you can get a glimpse into Paris life. The cheese store is typical and fabulous.",
            "We stayed here in August for 8 days. The rooms was very pleasant, clean and tidy. The staff were incredibly friendly, nice and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful-cold cereal, great coffee, yogurt and a wonderful basket of croissants, breads and pastries. The staff allowed us to store our bags there before and after our stay and, best of all, were really friendly and gave excellent information. In addition, we loved the location of the hotel-within walking distance to the main sights of Paris and two blocks from the Rue Mouffetard, full of charming bistros. It's possible to walk to Notre Dame, Pantheon, Jardin de Plantes, Jardin du Luxembourg ...",
            "Although it is listed with 4 stars, it did not give this impression. The location is great, however. Located in the 5th district, it is very close in the Latin Quarter and the area with some very nice restaurants, bars and nightlife. Also, very close to three metro stations and the Gare Austerlitz, where one can get a train to the Varsailles palace. Finally, it is located within 5 minutes of the Botanical garden, which is a hidden gem. The hotel offers breakfast, which was the typical fresh baguettes, croissants and pain de chocolat, with some very nice coffee. A great bakery across the street was a definate complement. If you want to see why French people love their bakeries, line up at the start of the day outside a bakery. The hotel decor and furniture definately needs some major renovation. The room was very small, even by Paris standards, although the bed was comfortable. Sound insulation was not that good, but being so tired at the end of the day, it did not matter much. The free Wifi was a definate plus. To us, the hotel was a nice place to sleep at the end of the day.",
            "I am a seasoned traveller and was lucky enough to have 2 weekends in a row in Paris recently. The first time I stayed with a friend in the Hotel Acte V around the corner from this one. It was great 3 star, modern refurb, friendly staff, great bar and lounge area, large well furnished rooms, aircdon, flat screen tv, little balconies, quiet, great location. For the second trip which was a romantic weekend away with my husband sans enfant I choose the 'sainte christophe' *because it was 150 points higher* than the Acte V on Trip advisor. What a *terrible* mistake. We couldn't believe it when we arrived to the drab, dated, run down place with no aircon and hot still little rooms (so hot other guests on the same floor were lying on their beds in the heat with the doors open for all to see!) This place is a 1 star compared to the Acte V and just shows how the good Trip Advisor system can be distorted wrongly and good hotels (and ultimately travellers pay). I have learnt from this run a mile from a hotel that appears on 'trip advisor' where every guest comment is followed by a management one thanking them as it shows the hotel doesn't have time to clean rooms properly (our room had a pile of old towels on the floor when we got there) or refurb. I know you can do much better for the money than the Sainte Christophe. They wouldn't let us cancel our booking for the first night but we stayed at the Acte V the second for sure thankfully.",
            "Hotel is very well located, just few steps from Place Monge. People are very nice and can help you for any information. Rooms are clean and nice according to Paris standards. Prices are more than ok for this hotel. Beds are ok, even if not fantastic. Definitely a good place!",
            "Great little hotel in the heart of Paris. The location is very central, near the Plade du Monge metro station. Very handy! The neighbourhood is very quiet for a big city, so getting a good night's sleep was not a problem! Located in the center of the lating quarter you are only about a 10-15 minute walk from the Notre Dame. The rooms are small, but very cosy - definitely big enough for what you need them for: sleep & shower! The only \"bad\" thing that I have to say is that the beds are a little to short to my liking and my partner's height, but they were otherwise very comfortable! The breakfast is simple & filling, enough to get you started. If you're looking for a bacon-and-eggs style of breakfast you won't find it here. The hotel also offers free Wi-FI, handy if you bring your laptop for some on-site sight/resturant research! We would definitely return to this hotel! The reception staff is very friendly and they also speak English. Note: Place du Monge has an excellent market on weekends - looking forward to explore the local cheeses and breads next time we are here!",
            "The first time we stayed in paris, we spent about $50 less per night and got a real substandard hotel... This time we were totally happy with this gem of a boutique hotel in the Latin Quarter. The location is awesome, only 2 streets from Rue Moufettard where all the restaurants are, 5 or 6 blocks from Notre Dame. Staff is like a family here and make suggestions. Rooms can be on the small side, but alllll european hotels have small rooms. We were on the street side, so there was some street noise at night. But it's awesome to have a little balcony in the morning to open the window out and smell the bakery below...",

            "I recently traveled to Paris for 1 week for a work conference and searched multiple areas for the \"perfect hotel.\" After a friend's recommendation, I discovered the hidden gem of Hotel Saint Christophe. Located on the left bank in the Latin Quarter, the hotel is within walking distance of Notre Dame, the Siene River, Luxemburg Gardens, and other major sites. Furthermore, the metro (line 7, Place Monge stop) and bus lines are readily accessible. While being ideally located and in close proximity to many places, the hotel was still quiet and personal. Additional perks include a nice, clean updated bathroom, free wireless internet in room and computer in hotel lobby, and very friendly staff. For European standards, the double room was also a decent size. Compared to other hotels in this area, Hotel Saint Christophe is a great value. I would definitely recommend the hotel to other travelers, and I will stay there on my return visits. Merci!",
            "We chose this hotel from the reviews on this site for our easter break. We chose right. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The hotel was cozy and elegant. Our room was bigger than I expected from a Paris hotel. It was clean and nicely furnished. Great location. Close to the Metro and walking distance to fantastic restaurants. Free wi-fi access. Price not too bad for Paris. We plan to stay here again.",
            "We stayed in this hotel tow years ago- loved it and recommended to our friends. This time- it was alittle bit disappointing. The room was tiny and smelly . We have no problem with litlle rooms, and even prefer the intimate feeling. But it was really too litlle! In addition, we asked, in advance, if there is a possibility, to make an early check in- we mentioned that i am pregnant in an advanced stage, and that our flight arrives early. We were answed that there will be no problem unless all the rooms will be occupied- an answer we found reasonably fair. Though, with our arrival we were told that there is no possibility to an early check in, since the hotel is full. Nonetheless, checking the hotel website, in the day of our arrival- there were 5 (!!!) double available rooms. It is true that no one owed us a thing- It is just the feeling that no gesture of good will was done. And it was the main problem during all our stay- the service was basic, and it seemed that no-one tries to halp wholeheartedly. That was the common attitude in the front desk and with the morning breakfest staff- who never smiled but looked very eager to ask the room number- giving an unpleasent feeling. So... the hotel still has its great location, reasonable price and basic but clean rooms, but there seems to be comparable possibilitis with batter attitude to the gustes.",
            "Me, my wife and my daughter stayed in this hotel from may 22 to may 27. The hotel has an excellent location in the Latin quarter, close to the metro, restaurants and places to visit. The staff were very nice to us, always willing to help and accommodate our requests. The room was very small, but it was enough to fit us and the crib that we requested for our 11 month old daughter. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",
            "We stayed eight nights in the St. Christophe. It is located in a lively neighborhood of students, tourists, families, shops and cafes. A short walk takes you to the Place Contrascarpe and Rue Moufetard with their many cafes. It's an easy walk to the Luxembourg gardens and even to the Seine and the Ille de Cite. Our room was small but cozy with a surprisingly large bathroom with full tub and stand up shower. Our room had large french windows that overlooked the street. The elevator is small but was in good order. The staff was professional and helpful. Metro stops are very close.",
            "This was the first hotel I stayed in on my one month trip of Europe and I was pleasantly surprised. While the room was small, it was not an issue for me as I was travelling solo. The room had a bar fridge, and the shower worked well. The room was very clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful in providing information on public transport options and spoke English quite well which was helpful as my French was limited. Breakfast was a little overpriced at 9 euro a day but you got a couple of pastries, yogurt, cereal and a choice of juice or tea or coffee. The location was quiet at night and a supermarket, pharmacy and the local metro station were very close by. Most of the attractions were in walking distance with the Pantheon very nearby. Would definitely recommend this other travellers - it was a great place to stay in Paris.",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Saint Christophe in April 2011 for five nights. We arrived early and our room was not yet ready. The reception staff offered to have the room ready within an hour if we needed to rest before beginning our touring. Our double room was well sized for Paris, clean, and extremely quiet. We were able to walk to all the tourists sights, except Montmarte and the Eiffel Tower. It's close to Rue Mouffetarde, which is packed with restaurants, cafes, and shops. Several metro stations are close; the neighborhood is safe at night. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast is a bit boring but included in the room price and adequate (great coffee). I would recommend this hotel for those who want a well-located, comfortable, budget-friendly hotel in Paris.",
            "On short notice we decided to take a trip to Paris over Thanksgiving. I was looking for a place on the right bank, but Hotel Saint Christophe had the right price. Our local travel agent helped book our stay. I had been warned that some 3-star hotels are not what they seem or what we would expect. From the moment of our arrival, we knew we had booked a great hotel. We arrived just after the beginning of the train strikes. The front desk staff was wonderful in giving directions, checking our train schedule (for traveling to the Loire Valley later in the week), and helping to arrange a tour to Versailles (since the trains weren't running). I have never seen such attentive staff! The rooms were clean--mine was on the 6th floor, had a balcony, and contrary to other reviews, the room and bathroom were of good size. My sister's was on the first floor, had 2 twin beds (kind of narrow), and had an even bigger room and bathroom. BOTH rooms were quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was simple, filling, and the staff were nice--coffee, croissants, rolls, cheese, yogurt, cereal, butter, and jam. The local flea market was great! Meats, cheeses, clothes, and treats! Hotel Saint Christophe is fairly centrally located--only 15 min walk to Notre Dame, 15 min walk to Gare Austerlitz, and many shops within a 10 min walking radius. We had a wonderful stay--we will return. Thanks!",
            "We have just returned from the St Christophe and a long weekend in Paris with our 3 children and partners to celebrate my 60th birthday. The hotel is very well situated for the metro (Monge) and for eating out on rue Mouffetard. As we were arriving on different days, I found that I could not book on any website - or I could, but would not have been certain of getting us all in - so I booked directly with the hotel. They were not willing to offer me the same deals available on websites (inclusive breakfast.. or even a free night) but the price was a not unreasonable 110euros per 'double' room. The \"children's\" rooms were all quite adequate; fairly small but clean and quite comfortable. Ours (24), unfortunately, was incredibly tiny and cramped with barely room to walk round the small double bed, the top of which was hemmed in by the only storage 'cupboards', so if you turned over too energetically in the middle of the night you crashed your elbow against them! The worst part was having next door's bathroom - and the lift shaft - in our room, hence the severe lack of space. So, do ensure that you specify that you do NOT want a room ending in 4! These rooms are certainly not of an appropriate size for 2 people - and would only suit someone a little on the deaf side! The reception staff were charming and helpful in every respect. They did try to see if an alternate room was available for us, but informed us that there wasn't one. I cannot comment on breakfast as we never managed to eat there - the breakfasting area was tiny and full the first morning, so we ate at a bar further up rue Monge on the left (les petits \u00e9coliers?) for 4e90. there is also an excellent boulangerie opposite and a good supermarket, Ed, on the other side of rue Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de heading for rue Mouffetard. [--] AMF",
            "This review is long overdue. My wife and i spent 10 nights at the Hotel Saint Christophe and after researching over 100 hotels we decided on this one. Wow did we ever luck out. Located in the Latin Quarter this location couldnt be better. We walked to most sights, @ 10 mins to the Notre Dame and the Metro was 1 block away. The rooms were bigger than i expected, and very clean and quiet. While we were there i just had to stop and check a few of the other hotels on my list, they were'nt even close to being as nice as the Hotel Saint Christophe. Our room included breakfast and it was a great way to start the day. As nice as the rooms and location were, the staff was excellent, always very pleasant and helpful and made out stay better than i ever inagined. when we come back to Paris we will definately stay here again and save myself hours of researching. I have already recommended this hotel to frinds of mine that are planning Paris this year. To the staff there if u remember us, we got you a fresh baguette daily. Thank you very much for a great stay in Paris. Hope to see you again.",
            "Location was not as close to Notre Dame as advertised, but still within a long walk. Some of the staff friendly and helpful. Our room was very small with old furniture, but clean. The bathroom was fine. First night the room was hot and had to sleep with the window open and the street noise was very loud. I asked the hotel staff to book and paid them directly for an airport shuttle for an early morning flight. I was in the lobby waiting for the shuttle and showed the desk clek my receipt. He called the driver in to get our luggage and help us board. To make a long story shorter I had been boarded on the wrong shuttle and therefore missed my flight and other connections. It was very expensive for me to rebook my flights. I called the hotel to see if they would at least refund my 2 nights stay to help offset my expenses. They would not accept responsibility nor would they offer anything other than a very weak apology.",
            "We stayed at St Christophe which is in the Latin Quarter in Paris in March of 2008. It was a wonderful location; right next to the Metro, walking distance to many restaurants and night life, and Notre Dame. The rooms were nice and the elevator was hilarious! I wouldn't suggest paying extra for the breakfasts. You can get more at the pastry shop across the street for less. The bathrooms were very nice and the water pressure was to die for. The rates were a little higher than I\u2019d like but it was well worth it. My favorite was the large tub with the gorgeous window that you could look out of while relaxing in a nice hot bath (which you will need for all of the walking! ).",
            "My husband and I just came back home from staying at the Hotel Saint Christophe in the Latin Quarter. We chose this hotel because of its reviews on this website, and we were not disappointed. The location is fantastic - just literally a 2 minute walk from the Place Monge subway, although we preferred to walk down to the Seine, by the Notre Dame, which is just merely about a 20 minute walk on Rue Monge. The staff at the hotel were always extremely friendly, helpful and courteous, the rooms were very clean and the bed very comfortable. We never heard any noises from the room next door, above or below us. Rue Monge is a little noisy, but we kept the front window closed at night, and left the bathroom window opened instead. Rue Mouffetard is just a short walk up from Rue Lecepede, where the hotel is located, and there is a vibrant nightlife there, with tons of restaurants, cafes, bakeries, supermarket, etc. We would most definitely stay at the Hotel Saint Christophe again, and would not hesitate to recomment it to other. Merci beaucoup!!! Au revoir!",
            "This hotel is essentially average. Given the multitude of choices in Paris, it's hard to go out and recommend it, but on the other hand there are a lot of worse places out there. The big plus is the location, which is essentially next to a Metro stop, as well as close to many shops/restaurants. The proximity to the university helps there. Also, the staff is quite friendly and helpful. There is also a computer, albeit a very slow one, with complimentary internet. Once you get used to the non-QWERTY European keyboard, it can come in handy. On the negative side of things, the cleanliness of the rooms isn't exactly top-notch. Not unusual for trash cans to not be cleaned, carpets to not be vacuumed, etc. Never mind personal items being strangely moved at times. Plus, the rooms can have a musty smell. Also, the rooms are very small (Tokyo small) but maybe not that unusual for Paris. And the lack of free wifi internet is becoming more of an issue now that so many hotels include it in their rate. As a side note, the breakfast should be avoided simply b/c it's not worth the cost. You can go to one of the many bakeries in the area and get much more for less than half the price. Overall, I don't think I'd necessarily stay again, but if you perhaps get a great deal, then it might be worth trying this hotel out...",
            "We stayed here mid-week from 21 to 25 January 2008 and our experience was superb. The hotel is situated close to Notre Dame, in a good area near to some lovely bars, cafes and restaurants. It is ideally located for exploring Paris on foot, but for the less active it is also close to a number of Metro stations. The hotel staff were faultlessly helpful and friendly. The reception staff spoke excellent English which was perfect given my rusty French. We had a room on the fifth floor which was cosy but very comfortable and warm. Outside street noise was not a problem. Most importantly, the room, bathroom and bed linen were spotlessly clean. However, some travellers may wish to take note that the size of the room and the small lift which serves each of the floors might prove problematic for wheelchairs. The hotel facilities included a small breakfast room where a decent continental breakfast was served, and an internet room. To be honest, we didn't expect or require much more. All in all this hotel was a real charm and I would certainly stay here again.",
            "Good quality, mid-range Parisien hotels have always eluded us.....until now. The Saint Christophe is a little gem, and we will definitely use it when we return to Paris again. The staff were helpful and courteous; the room was exceptional (for a Parisien hotel! ), in that its decor was unobtrusive, it was clean, all the plumbing worked, it was medium-sized but with sufficient storage areas for two people for 4 nights and the bed was very comfortable; the lift was fine (I don't understand why some people in their reviews of this hotel make a fuss about the size of the lift!) ; and breakfast was sufficient - very french, and with the choice of cheese and yoghurt as well the usual juice, tea/coffee/chocolate, croissant, rolls and jam, it could just do with the addition of a bowl of fresh fruit for customers to pick at. The reception area helpfully carries daily newspapers, a daily weather report and a pc terminal, and is a pleasant, light area in which to sit too. Situation-wise, the hotel is excellent, just a few minutes walk from the metro monge. The Jardin des Plantes is 5 minutes walk one way, and the student/market area starting at Place Contrescarpe is 5 minutes the other way. Here you can get practically any type of food you could wish for - vegetarian, italien, spanish, algerian, asian, turkish, greek, moroccan, etc etc. You can also get right to the heart of many parisien sights within 20-30 minutes walk eg. notre dame, boulevard st michel, cluny museum etc. The hotel will store your luggage for free, once you've checked out. In all, a really great hotel, well worth the money.",
            "We had traveled in june. We had booked 2 rooms double and twin., (1 couple, 1 teenage daughter and grandmother). . The rooms was sufficent in size, the bed and pillows were very comfortable. A portable fan was provided. Our window remained closed during the night related to the street noise. The room did not have air conditioner. I would not feel comfortable if we had booked it in aug when it would be hot. the bathroom had a tub/shower. The staff was very accommadating and nice.They did speak english very well. They had recommeded resturants in the area, arranged our transportation to the airport. The area is clean and safe. I would recommend it for famiiles. The hotel does have a lift. The hotel was close to the Metro, Plenty of resturants within walking distance to choose from! Breakfast : cold cereal, yoguart, tea/coffee/ orange juice/ plenty of the croissants/breads! We would recommend this hotel for anyone.",
            "We stayed at this hotel for four nights in September 2008. We found the location to be excellent as it's a very short walk to many dining locations and the Metro. We found the front desk staff to be very friendly and hospitable. The room was small, but it is what we expected for a room in Paris. We found the room to be clean, and that is all we wanted as we only use the room for sleeping! There is just too much to see and do in Paris! We can't comment on the breakfast as we didn't eat at the hotel, but picked up food as we walked around the city. We would definately stay here again, and would recommend this hotel to our friends.",
            "We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 19 day trip to France in September 2007. We wanted somewhere reasonable and central for exploring Paris, but not a modern cookie-cutter hotel room. This hotel was clean, quiet, convenient but still had the old world charm we were looking for, right in the Latin Quarter (arrondissement 5). It's located near Jardin des Plantes, and within easy walking distance to the Panth\u00e9on and Notre Dame. It's very near two M\u00e9tro stops (Place Monge and Cardinal Lemoine). I think the latter was better for suitcases as there were less stairs. Breakfast is served in the basement, nothing fancy but enough to get you going in the morning. If we ever had any questions, the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room overlooked the street, but was quiet and very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.",
            "We stayed in the Saint Christophe for a week. It was overall a very pleasant location. The location is perfect: very nice neighborhood and the hotel is right on top of a subway station. The rooms were very nice and clean, the bathrooms were exceptionally clean and well equipped. WiFi internet was available at no charge. Breakfast was OK according to French standards but the staff serving it was a bit sloppy sometimes. The price was great for Paris. I would certainly recommend it to anyone.",
            "We stayed in this hotel for four nights in early September, 2006. I agree with the review, two below, \"Comfortable....\". We love this neighborhood, and the Contrescarpe square just minutes from this hotel. One issue to consider. Paris is noisy at night. Very few 3-star hotels have air conditioning (including this one). If you are there when it is warm at night, you will need the window open and you will hear a good deal of noise from Rue Monge all night. I would stay at this hotel again if in a cool season but would pay more for a hotel with AC if in warm weather.",
            "We stayed here for 5 nights in 2006, on the recommendation of a French friend and previous tripadvisor reviews. On our experience, we would be happy to stay here again. Staff were welcoming and friendly, able to point us towards a local square containing several cafes and restaurants and a vibrant nightlife - it seemed like staying in a small village, rather than a capital city. The inhouse breakfast is plain and basic, but there are plenty of eateries to hand, and the Seine and Notre Dame are within an easy walk. The room was small but very clean and comfortable, with a shuttered bathroom window - one could recline in the bath and feel the city just outside. Romantic, and the whole setting is just right as a stepping point to explore the city.",
            "We just had 3 nights at the St Christpohe and loved it. This is our 3rd trip to Paris and this hotel and location was the best so far. Very close to place monge metro, market and shops. Walk to saint germaine, pantheon. Staff were really friendly and helpful. The room were ok size for Paris, a little dated but clean and a good bathroom. My only concern was that the rooms were a little hot - they do provide a fan though. When we were there it was nice weather but not all that hot, so I am not sure if we would have enjoyed our stay so much if it had have been over 25 degrees. Apart from that though it is a great hotel and you will struggle to find better value in Paris. We will be back!",
            "We stayed at the St. Christophe in September, 2007, and we'd gone to Paris for a honeymoon trip. (We're older newlyweds; my husband had never been to Paris, and it was my first trip in over 30 years.) We liked the hotel very, very much--especially the two large windows in the room and the lovely, clean bathroom-- and we are thinking about booking here again for a trip this coming November. We had gotten a rate that included breakfast, and the servers in the breakfast room were polite and helpful. (The bakery across the street is indeed excellent, and the people there very nice and helpful.) The restaurants immediately surrounding the hotel are a bit touristy, but I think that the people at the desk would make recommendations if asked--and, of course, the hotel is conveniently located.",
            "We spent five nights at the hotel and had a wonderful time in paris. I would agree with most of the reviews- the hotel is small, clean and in a real- not touristy area. I watched the neighbourhood life going on through the windows as I woke up in the morning. I would say that the hotel seemed very warm and I probably would have found it too hot in the summer.It is in an ideal location for the local metro, small cafes etc up at the place de la contrascope where we ate most evenings. The room at the front was noisy but we expected that as we were in a busy capital city.",
            "We stayed there twice this year & were very impressed with the location- just where we wanted to be, central but but quiet. The decor was either right up to date & retro or still left over from the 70s. I suspect the latter. The staff were very helpful, the rooms very clean & comfortable- the lift was minute. Breakfast was good. They seemed to want to lock the front door as early as they could but always opened it promptly. I don't know how family friendly it is but it was ideal for two adults A really good find right in the Latin Quarter, not too cheap/not too pricey...good value.",
            "My friend and I stayed for 4 nights. Loveley and clean. Metro nearby and central to all attractions. Rooms on the small side but had all you need, only nitpick tea and coffee making facilities would be nice. Breakfast was great and all the staff spoke better english than my friend and I speak french. Some lovely cafes nearby too. Would recommend to anyone spending a few days in Paris.",
            "Stayed for a weekend in February - the hotel is undergoing some exterior renovation but we experienced NO noise and the windows were not really blocked at all - so dont worry about that unless you stay during the week and plan to spend all day sitting inside your hotel room! Friendly staff, decent breakfast (baguettes, croissants, cereal, yogurts, etc). Down the street from huge park and about 2 blocks from Mouffetard (lots of restaurants/shops/great Sunday marketplace). Less than 3 minute walk from Metro (Place Monge) and there is another metro stop on a different line a little bit further up the street.",
            "We stayed for 8 nights in room 64, on the sixth floor up under the eaves with a sloping ceiling. Small room, as expected, but lovely and clean. Two big windows opening onto small balconies. Good for catching a nice breeze. Location was great- walking distance to most major attractions and also close to many public transit options. Nice neighbourhood to wander in. We bought breakfast each morning at a bakery across the street and walked to the Jardin des Plantes to eat sitting on a bench under the Cedar of Lebanon tree. Reception was wonderful - fluent in English and always friendly and very helpful. Appreciated the free internet usage for quick emails home. Highly recommended!",
            "Thanks to Trip Advisor and those of you who submitted reviews of this lovely hotel. We spent 4 nights at the Saint Christophe 21-25 September 05. Yes, the rooms are fairly small - but aren't they in most European hotels - however, the staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and the location is great. It was nice to be away from the really touristy areas and really enjoy the local Parisian life surrounding the hotel. At the same time we were only a few metres from the closest metro station to take us anywhere around town, and within a 30 minute walk of Notre Dame. Have to say that the little Pastiseries not far from the metro station have treats to die for! Would highly recommend this property and would stay there again next time we're in Paris.",
            "My wife booked this little gem of a hotel for a recent weekend in Paris and would def have to recommend it. It is really central within the Latin Quarter and right beside the Metro, lots of restaurants and bars, and within walking distance of many of the main sites. We arrived at noon and had a great welcome at reception with lots of recommendations. The rooms are Paris size (smallish) - but very comfortable and clean. Again, throughout our stay the staff were very helpful and polite.",
            "The hotel we had previously stayed at in Paris was booked on our dates so we decided to stay in a different area i.e. the left bank. This hotel stood out as the reviews on one of the websites were personally responded to by the management. This meant that they cared about their customers. Hotel was easy to find just round the corner from Place Monge Metro and Jussieu and Cardinal Limone were a short walk away. We were on the 6th floor. We could see the top of the Eiffel Tower from our window. Our room was smallish but clean and had all necessary requirements. We had breakfast included with the booking deal. The breakfast was ideal - cereal, yoghurt, bread and criossants with juice and tea or coffee. The servers were friendly. The hotel is in a quiet part of Paris just off the Rue Monge and we found no problems sleeping.",
            "This is a charming little hotel in a lovely area of Paris. Nice, spotlessly clean room with comfy bed and lots of storage space. We really enjoyed our stay there. If you like a quiet room I'd suggest a room to the back as the street outside is very noisy at all hours, especially if you have to open windows due to lack of air con. Really liked hotel and would go back!",
            "Firstly thanks to all of you who take the time to write reviews, I spent a lot of time on the site to pick a hotel within budget but suitable for my fussy younger sister and was very pleased with this recommendation. The biggest highlight for us which probably can not be guaranteed was that our room was ready for us when we arrived at 09:30 after an early early trip on the Eurostar from London. Our room looked into a centre courtyard shared by the other buildings so absolutely no view but very quiet. The room was nothing to shout about but it was nice enough. The bathroom was small but I'd say in its defence it was a really nice bathroom by inexpensive hotel standards well laid out, totally modern, great shower pressure, clean and a nice sized shower. The staff were excellent in helping us located a place to eat - when we got back just before midnight, arranging our trip to Versailles and offered to arrange transport to the airport etc. This hotel is close to the metro and it was super easy to get around Paris. All in all a good experience.",
            "We stayed at the St Christophe recently for a short Paris trip. I checked out the hotel with tripadviser first and the reviews were right. The hotel is in a good position with a metro stop just round the corner. It is situated in the Latin Quarter with lively squares and streets a short walk away. The room itself was a little small but perfectly adequate for our needs. The bathroom was spotless as was the rest of the hotel. Linen was changed regularly even though we were only there for four days. Breakfast was continental and perfectly adequate. It was quiet at night and although a little hot (There was a bit of a heatwave) the hotel provided a fan in the room. The staff were friendly and helped us with booking trips etc. I would certainly stay here again.",
            "My partner and I stayed here for 10 days during Sept/11. We found the hotel to be very clean and quiet. The view was great with flowers in the window boxes on iron balconies which was very Parisienne. The room was a decent size and the bed was comfortable. We had a TV which did offer a couple of English stations and a radio in the room as well. The bathroom was clean with a full tub and shower and it had a window as well. We took the breakfast option which included coffee, juice, croissants and cheese and jellies which was very good. The hotel was in a good area, close to shops, pharmacies, cafes, restaurants, parksand the metro and bus routes.There was even a market which operated 2 days of the week. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay.",
            "There are good and weak points concerning the St Christophe. It is very reasonable for a 3 star hotel ( we paid about \u00a3340 for 3 nights in a double room B and B . )The location is excellent, right next to the Metro Place Monge and just a short trip into Paris.The area is full of restaurants and bars. Service was excellent and friendly with english spoken. The bathroom was clean and the shower excellent.You are also able to use the computer in the Reception area for free.The rooms are small and dark however and we did not have bedside lights. It was December but the room was always warm. There is only one english channel on the TV. Breakfast was adequate for 8 eu each but the breakfast room was small although welcoming. It might be a problem if the hotel was full. There is not much choice apart from 2 types of cereals, pain, croissants, yoghurt etc. The one major thing that concerned me is that there is just one central staircase plus a lift and if there was a fire and this was inaccessible , you would be in danger. There are no other fire exits. You would have to wait at the window for the fire brigade! Presumably the authorities have cleared it for safety? In the area, the best bistro we went to is L'Estrapade up near the Pantheon. This place was superb.",
            "We stayed for four nights at the Hotel Saint Christophe at the end of September. Very close to Place Monge with its thrice weekly market and metro stop, the Saint Christophe is decidedly convenient for the Latin Quarter and central Paris. Our room was located in the front of the hotel, and with the windows open, the street noise was almost unbearable. However, with the windows closed (not an option all times of year), it was relatively quiet. The bed was extremely small, though, making it difficult for two normal sized adults to sleep comfortably. There is some storage space, but the configuration made it difficult to access. The bathroom was clean and functional, but limited space made it challenging to access toiletries for two people. Shower gel and shampoo were provided in tiny tear packages, which we found insufficient for lathering up; bring your own. The breakfast room downstairs is mundane compared to many hotels of this sort, and the breakfast (included in our rate) even more so. While we're used to small continental breakfasts, good bread or croissants make them enjoyable. The service was generally gracious and inviting. We had one small problem with housekeeping leaving only one bath towel, met with the classic French \"Impossible!\" when we informed the front desk, but then rapidly resolved. All in all, we found this a solid property but nothing special.",
            "It took a Paris cab driver nearly 30 minutes to find this hotel after leaving the metro at St Michel. Can't understand why because I pointed her in the right direction and it was my first trip to Paris. It is a delightful hotel, small rooms but adequate. Lovely breakfast served in the basement and helpful on reception. About 15 min walk slightly downhill to Notre Dame but if you need the metro there is one just a few blocks away. A very enjoyable stay.",
            "This hotel is in an excellent location. Winthin walking distance to most major sites but still has a neighborhood feel. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is a perfect start to the day. The rooms are small the bathrooms are bigger than average. This is my favorite place to stay in Paris.",
            "The hotel was tucked away on a side street so it was very quiet. It is also located to numerous subway stops. The hotel itself is very small. The elevator was tiny, but it was able to accomodate both of us and our luggage. The room was average size for European standards. The staff was friendly and they spoke English. They willingly gave us directions to attractions and helped us book a shuttle back to CDG. If we make it back to Paris, we would stay here again.",
            "I booked this hotel based on other reviews, so after my experience I thought I should tell people mine. Although a good location and a comfortable room I found the staff quite unfriendly. The most unpleasant thing to happen was that half of my La Prairie eyecream had been used after returning from a day of sight seeing. I don't mean to sound spoilt but I saved up for this cream as a holiday treat and half of it had been scooped out and used - it was extremely obvious. From then on I locked all of my possesions (including toiletries) in my suitcase each morning and whenever I left the room. They do advise the use of the safe but I did not think that meant face products! I will never stay there again.",
            "A great place to land after an exhausting schedule. After a quick day in Paris and then travel to Brugge, Belgium and Beaune, Burgandy by train for four days, we stayed here for two nights. The room was large enough for a mature couple and the service was excellent. We appreciated having the internet and two TV channels in English. The bathroom was clean and the shower was large enough to bend over, which we hadn't had at other hotels. The staff spoke English for us and were helpful with directions for internet signup and local travel. I'd recommend this hotel to any traveller.",
            "The hotel manager was so heplful to confirm our shuttle booking to the airport, he did not mind to use his own cell phone and spoke French to clarify the pick up time. The ladies in the breakfast area were very friendly and courteous. The hotel was very closed to a nice ,hanging out place to find a decent dinner for a very good price (3- course meal with delicious desert for about 9 to 15 euros) .Good and central location Free hotel internet in the lobby.We traveled around Europe for 4 weeks ,stayed in several hotels ,from 2 to 4 stars , St. chistophe was the only hotel offered free internet.",
            "Hotel staff gave great restaurant recommendations, spoke English very well, always willing to help and answer our questions. Chose the hotel after reading other posts and am glad we did. Very quiet , our room was on the top floor.room was small, but expected this, but was clean, and having a mini fridge in our room stocked with cold drinks was a nice perk too. The hotel staff even helped to make arrangements for us to get back to the airport by shuttle when we checked out. Would definitely recommend staying here, address is 17 rue lacepede, near rue monge.",
            "This was an excellent hotel for my friend and me for our 5-day visit to Paris. We could walk to all of the centrally-located sites and there was a Metro stop and very nice outdoor market 1 block away. A number of the guests took the breakfast but we preferred the many cafes and boulangeries nearby (all less expensive). I had a TERRIBLE experience with the airport shuttle service. They picked me up on time but proceeded to spend over an hour driving all over Paris picking up other customers. If I hadn't had priority access on my airline, I would have missed my flight. But the hotel itself was a good value.",
            "We liked the location which is near the botanical gardens. The hotel is slightly out of the tourist mainstream but was only a 15 minute walk to Notre Dame. We stayed in two different rooms and both were small. The breakfast is standard and not worth the $12 price since there are pastry shops nearby and a morning food market at the Place Monge. The staff of this hotel are very friendly and accommodating.",
            "My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay. We had a wonderful experience with the Saint Christophe. After reading so many positive reviews on tripadvisor, we booked this hotel for our first visit to Paris. We were not disappointed. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were spotless and modern. The staff was lovely and accommodating. Breakfast was included in our rate and was perfect to hold us over until lunch. The location was ideal, as it is near two metro stops and also convenient to access most of Paris' center on foot. Book a room with confidence. We are particularly fussy travelers and have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel. We would gladly stay here again and are confident to recommend it to others.",
            "I have just returned from a weekend break with 5 friends to the Hotel St Christophe. The area around the hotel is typically Parisian, with lots of shops, restaurants and cafes, with a wonderful market in the Place Monge. Three Metro stations within walking distance. The young lady at reception was extremely helpful - nothing was too much trouble for her, including leaving our luggage in a locked room both on the day of arrival and the day of departure. The bedrooms were quite small, but okay for short stays. Everything was very clean and nicely decorated. The only negative comment would be the small breakfast room. Tables too small for 4 people, and everyone packed in so close that it was difficult to get up and move around without disturbing others. I would certainly recommend the hotel to others, and I hope to return at some future date.",
            "Booked this hotel on the internet having sought location advice from Trip Advisor. When travelling in France we always book Logis De France hotels as these have never disappointed. They are always lovely warm and friendly stopovers. This hotel is small but really comfortable with quite big rooms for Paris and a great en-suite. The staff are really friendly and will make calls for you and arrange trips. The hotel is close to a really exciting daily market and about 10/15 mins. walk of Notre Dame and the right bank. Breakfasts are great with croissants,chocolate croissants, yoghurts, cereal, cheese and crusty bread. Tea, coffee, water and pure orange juice are available along with jams. Be sure to go to Shakespeare and Co book shop on the bank of the Seine, a great experience. My children booked us a treat ride from the airport with ------------ and two lovely men, Vincent and Jimmy made our Paris experience with a night drive through Paris past all the sights. Magic.",
            "This is a small, but charming hotel in an excellent location. The rooms are small, but spotlessly clean and the reception staff are very helpful. There are very good restaurants just a short walk away on the Rue Mouffetard, and the two nearby metro stations make it an excellent base.Lack of air conditioning could be a problem in summer months, though there is a fan in the room.Having paid more for worse accommodation, I shall certainly return to this hotel.",
            "We just returned from 2 weeks in Paris and stayed at the Hotel Saint Christophe. This is a charming little hotel that is amazingly convenient and walking-distance from so many sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame, the Pantheon, Rue Mouffetard, the Seine, etc. The staff and service were fantastic and very forthcoming with any assistance we required. As for size of the room, you have to go to Paris minus the North American expectations, unless you can afford the Ritz! We would definitely stay at this hotel again! Danny & Dante Toronto, Canada",
            "We just returned from a week at the Saint Christophe, and we enjoyed it tremendously. The rooms are cosy and very well maintained. I saw some negative comments in some earlier reviews about the beds, but we throught they were excellent; I am 6' 3\" and was very comfortable in one of the twin beds. The bathrooms are very modern and are excellent as well; ours had a \"razor point\" where you can plug in a US-110 volt electric device without the need for a converter. I also saw some earlier negative comments about street noise. At least during this time of year, when we slept with the windows closed, we heard nothing. We really enjoyed the breakfasts. There is plenty served, and the convenience of having the breakfast in the hotel is terrific. We didn't make many requests of the staff, but whenever we did they were extremely pleasant and responsive. It's true, as recently noted here, that the Place Monge metro station is closed for repairs. Don't be put off by that -- the Jussieu station is only a few minutes' walk away. We loved the location. It is especially nice to be so close (two blocks) to the Jardin des Plantes. My son wanted to run every morning before breakfast, and this was an ideal place for that. For us non-runners, it was a beautiful spot for a walk among the gardens and the menagerie. The hotel is also an easy walk to the Gare d'Austerlitz, which was our departure point for a day trip to Versailles. There are a wide variety of good restaurants only two blocks away on Rue Mouffetard, and this is only a 10-15 minute walk from Notre Dame. All in all, it was a delightful hotel at a good price. I would definitely stay there again.",
            "I stayed here for a week in September 2011 with a friend, and we were not disappointed. The hotel is in a great location in the Latin Quarter, near to the Mosque, the Jardin de Plantes, and two wonderful markets. Our room was quiet, facing on to Rue de La Clef, and quite roomy. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times, and I would definitely return - if I'm ever fortunate enough to get to Paris again ...",
            "Just returned from a great few days in this wonderful city.Oct 11-16Great weather,great food,and of course a great little hotel.Catherine and moi spent five nights in the St.Christophe and we fully agree with all the positive comments made here.The hotel itself is spotlessly clean as was our room which was on the 5th floor,with a lovely view over side streets.The staff are friendly and helpful,and really made us feel welcome. A couple of tips to help you on your visit: We arrived from Dublin in CGD at 4 pm.We decided to be adventurous and take the RER to Chatalet then line 7 to Pl. Monge................................a big mistake.Chatalet is a nightmare at rush hour,even moreso with luggage!! Take a taxi its less stressful.About 40mins and 40 euro should see you to your hotel. The 47 Bus is very useful for getting downtown,it drops you back almost at the door of the hotel.Bon Voyage, we will return to the St. Christophe.",
            "We read many reviews in this website before deciding on where to stay for our first trip to Paris. We wanted somewhere comfortable and centrally located without having to spend a bomb. Saint Christophe was just that. The lady at the front desk was helpful, friendly and can communicate well in English. The room we had was clean and big enough for the two of us. There were many places to eat around the hotel and the the Metro is just less than 5 mins walk away. For people who are planning to visit in summer, you might want to know that there is no air-condition or fan in the room and it can be quite noisy in the street if you open up the windows. That said, I would still go back to Saint Christophe for its value for money.",
            "Thank you Tripadvisor reviews. We chose this little gem because of Tripadvisor and as per usual it did not disappoint us. We had a wonderful stay at Saint Christophe. All positives were echoed in most of the reviews. A good location,at a great price for Paris that was clean, with a modern bathroom, and helpful, pleasant staff. Easy to get to from CDG. Metro practically outside the door if you want to use it. We walked everywhere...it helped to wear off the croissants and wine! Elevator tiny and we would have liked to keep our key but that was not an issue. Definitely would repeat and recommend!",
            "Note: This review is actually based on our stay in October 2009. This hotel was really cute and surprised us. The rooms were much bigger then we expected for a European city hotel. We lucked out and got a corner room on the 4th floor with 2 nice big windows. Our room has a good sized, fully equipped, private bathroom. We left our key with the front desk when we went out, which I thought was odd but I guess this is customary? But the desk attendants were friendly and tried to help us although there was the language barrier. We felt very safe here and they locked the front door after a certain time so you get buzzed in by the front desk. We didn't really take advantage of the complimentary breakfast but I don't think it really offered much. We walked A LOT to get to a lot of the main tourist attractions, and we also took full advantage of the city subway system, which had a station a few blocks away. It was very easy to use and navigate! The bakery/cafe across the street was yummy and there was plenty of restaurants and shops to keep you full and busy. Message me for more info about our Paris trip!",
            "Loved our stay at Saint Christophe very comfortable.We arrived earlier so our room was not ready, we stored our luggage and went sightseeing arround .The location is great..Our room was on the 4th floor room 41,the little elevator is cozy,good view of Rue Monge our room was nice and clean.Enjoyed the breakfast room miss my baguette with jam and their coffee is very good.For places to eat lots nearby....Place contrescarpe,Rue Mouffetard and Ile Saint louis....metro stop at place Monge is just around the corner just have to remember lots of stairs at that metro station but it was okay with us....would definitely stay their again....the staff is very helpful...thanks for making our stay enjoyable....",
            "I stayed at this hotel recently for 3 nights and for a boutique hotel in Paris it is defintely one of the nicer ones I have stayed in. The hotel is in a good location (for good restaurants nearby head towards Rue Mouffetard) and the hotel is very clean with lovely furniture and tastefully decorated. While the room is small having stayed in several boutique hotels in Paris I can assure you that this is the case everywhere and I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the bathroom. The big downside for me however was the noise of the metro. I could feel the vibrations of the metro from my room and this definitley affected my ability to sleep (it runs from around 5am until well after midnight so only a 4 hour window in between!). I was on the third floor so it's not like I was close to the basement. As I mentioned previously I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Paris but have never experienced this before and for this reason I won't be returning to this hotel which is such a pity as I thought it was excellent in every other aspect.",
            "A real parisienne experience. The hotel is a beautiful building and the location perfect. We walked everywhere and the local area is a delight with many bars and FRIENDLY restaurants. We are an older couple and went to Paris to get engaged - it was all perfect and the hotel's ambience added to the experience. Highly recommended if you want a small, local hotel as opposed to a large modern one. Many thanks - we would return and recommend you to friends. Margaret and David",
            "My husband and I stayed at this hotel in June for 5 nights and I was disappointed. Very, very small room, but I guess that was to be expected. You open the door and you can touch the bed, but it was clean, as was the bathroom, with adequate closet space. The only electrical outlet was in the bathroom, and I did not like the fact that there was no peephole or a chain on the door. Tiny TV, no air, but a reasonable size fan and you could open the windows, which of course let in all the street noises. I guess because of the size of the room and the fact that my bags were kind of blocking the bed, it was not made up for 2 days. Once I squashed my bags on top of each other, the bed was made. The breakfast was sparse in choices, and after the first day we left it alone. Close to metro, other attractions and dozens of restaurants 2 blocks away, try the Tire-Bouchon restaurant, 47 rue Descartes, fabulous food.",
            "We spent a week at the hotel St. Christophe off rue Monge, and we were happy we picked this hotel, based on TripAdvisor reviews. The price of $125/night included a decent breakfast, cereal, yogurt, croisant, cheese, o.j. and tea or coffee. The mattress was nice and firm, the room completely clean, the shower had terrific water pressure and lots of very hot water. The room faced the street, yet was very quiet. The Metro stop is a half block away and makes it easy to zip around Paris. We walked from the hotel to Notre Dame, the Louvre, Luxembourg Garden and many other places. My husband got sick, and the hotel helped us get a cab to the hospital. I told them they didn't need to chage the linens that day, and they said they would do it while we were gone. They were always very helpful and pleasant. With the money you save on lodging, you can gain weight at the many fantastic restaurants around the city!",
            "We recently stayed for 4 nights at St Christophe. We had a twin room facing the street, (which was very quiet), decent sized bathroom, and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was included in the price, and was a good start to the day. The staff were great, and we liked the location. All in all, we very much enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.",
            "A good value hotel in a good area. The rooms are super tiny and the Internet rarely worked. The bathroom was comfortable other than the shower curtain being too short so water would soak the bathroom floor. Which meant we had to waste our clean towels to sop up the water daily.",
            "The best thing about this hotel is its location but that is not taking anything away from the staff, who are helpful and professional. The downside on this occasion was that the lift was out of order but I was offered another room on the second floor, instead of the sixth floor. The location, as mentioned, is great. It's a stone's throw from the metro, near a lot of great bars and restaurants and Jardin Luxembourg is around the corner. On Sundays there's even a little market where you can stock up on Camembert and French sticks for the journey back home (if you don't mind stinking out the plane/train). The rooms overall are what can be expected from a Parisian hotel in this category; a little too wobbly and wonky for comfort but perfectly agreeable for a couple of nights only.",
            "Arrived exhausted (my problem); sink not working, cleaned up in tub, informed reception (they already knew), trekked off for hours to try to get my phone fixed, came back, napped and woke at 8:00pm. Sink not working!! Went to reception \"What do you expect us to do at this time of night?\" they said very stroppily. No, we don't have any other rooms. This was the classic Parisian 'not my problem' rudeness that people complain about, but in all my trips to Paris I had never seen before. Incroyable, or whatever. Not even, Madame, I am so sorry. Could you wash in the tub, je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9 but there is nothing to be done. When I returned after dinner they did have another room. I suppose I have just got used to better customer service over the years and was utterly shocked at the brush off I got for a real issue. I am the sort who recently put up a very run down hotel in the port in La Cieba, moribund rentals here and there, tiny rooms, bumpy beds...I am not particularly fussy, but if you don't want to make the traveller welcome you should not be in the hotel trade.",
            "We have been to Paris five times and stayed in a different hotel each time. We will stay at the St Christophe again. The location is wonderful, walking distance to Notre Dame and the walking street, Rue Mouffetard. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We were very grateful for their help arranging transportation to the airport during the transportation strike. We highly recommend staying at the Hotel St Christophe",
            "My wife and i were in paris at the end of March 2010 and i can honestly say we were pleasantly surprised with Saint Christophe. Location and value for money for such a major city was exceptional. The rooms were fairly basic but were of a decent size, so i was very happy with that after i'd just stayed in one of the smallest hotel rooms i had ever seen in London. The staff were very welcoming and were always happy to help you with whatever was needed. The Metro is very close and with the transport system in Paris being so good, and easy to use you can get to all the major tourist sites in no time at all. Absolutely fell in love with the city itself, so i am certain to be heading back sometime in the near future and i have no reason to consider looking for anywhere else to stay.",
            "We had a 4 night stay at the Saint Christophe, and would heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in Paris. The area is great, not too busy or too touristy (except for Rue Mouffetard a couple of blocks away) with lots of restaurants, shops, bakeries etc. nearby, and very close to 2 metro stations. Though Place Monge station does have a lot of stairs - we managed with our 2 large suitcases, baby and pram, but was a bit of a workout, so best be prepared for this! We were pleasantly surprised with the size of our room on the third fllow - even with a cot for our 6 month old baby, we still had ample room. Free wifi was great, as was the generous breakfast in the morning, with lovely pastries and lots of coffee! The ladies who served breakfast were very friendly, and were very kind to our baby. Reception staff were also very helpful, and always had a smile for us. They spoke English perfectly as mentioned by other reviewers. A few other touches were appreciated - extra rubbish bags were provided in our room for the baby, as well as extra towels and amenities. THe hotel was definitely one of our favourites during the holiday - we felt very at home, and welcomed. Hoping to travel back one day!",
            "My three girlfriends and myself stayed at the Hotel St. Christophe in the February half-term and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. They advised us were to find lovely restaurants and we were not disappointed. The hotel rooms were very clean and comfortable and the breakfast was continental and although not a great choice was enough to set you up for the morning. The location was excellent and only ten minutes walk to Notre Dame were we boarded the Red tour bus which I pre-booked through discount website and paid \u00a320.00 each for the two days. I also pre-booked the Eiffel Tower and although we did have to wait it was not as long as the people who had not pre-booked. We visited the Musee d'Orsay and did have to wait about an hour to get in so I would advise if you know you are going to visit the museum pre-book! Being only four women we felt very safe around the hotel area and the restaurants we visited were about five minutes walk. The only negative that I could find with the hotel was that they did not have a safe in the room but they did have a system in place to look after any passports or valuables. I would highly recommend the hotel and if I visit Paris again would have no hessitation in booking this hotel.",
            "This was going to be a four star review, we loved the hotel, the room was comfortable and clean & the bathroom was good with an excellent shower. There was noise from I think the metro but nothing tragic. The location was good & there were plently of places to eat & drink within a few minutes walk. The downside was that at check in we were encouraged to book a shuttle to the airport & a pick up time was suggested (& accepted) we paid a deposit. We arrived back at the hotel ahead of the agreed time. After waiting for around 30 minutes after the shuttle was due the man on reception phoned the shuttle operators & we were informed that there has been a mistake & there would be a further delay before the shuttle would arrive but the timing could not be guaranteed. On this basis we cancelled the shuttle & used the RER / Metro to get to the airport & we made it with a few minutes to spare. This was poor and the stress this problem caused detracted from what was an enjoyable weekend. To repeat a great hotel, but avoid offers of shuttle airport transfers - I was told this was unsual - but one problem of this nature is one too many...we could have missed our flight!",
            "Let me start by saying that this hotel is in a good location (Latin Quarter) and the rooms are clean and adequate. The reason I am giving them a low rating is b/c of their bizarre and unsafe key policy. They want you to leave your room key with them everytime you step out of the hotel. And when I say leave your key with them, I do not mean behind some secure counter where only the hotel staff have access. There is an open cabinet with hooks next to (not behind) the reception desk within easy access of anybody who walks into the lobby. In fact when we first showed up there was nobody in the lobby for at least 5 minutes, plenty of time for somebody to stroll in, grab a key (b/c they know whatever key they pick, that room will be empty) and take whatever they want. For the first couple of nights we just kept the key and waked quickly out of the lobby before any staff could say anything. However on our last night in Paris as we were walking out to get some dessert the guy manning the desk (actually he was on the lobby computer which is supposed to be for guests instead of behind the reception desk) asked for our key. When we explained we didn't feel safe leaving the key he became heated and said it was hotel policy and although his english wasn't good we thought he said he would call the police on us if we didn't hand over our key. We started to fear he would lock us out if we stepped out so we had the pleasure of spending our last night in Paris trapped in our room. If you don't mind handing over security of your items to some hired help who was hogging the guest's computer (by the way they charge for wifi which is really nickel and diming guests) by all means stay here.",
            "The reviews say that the rooms are on the small size - they are, but if you are in Paris to see Paris then this is a perfect hotel. It is near the zoo/park - worth a walk through one morning. Just down the road is a little morning market and up another small road to the right (just before the hotel) is a small square with lots of bars for an evening drink. Its close to the metro and an easy 12min stroll to Notre Dame. The desk are friendly but I score service low as breakfast is pretty basic (thick black coffee and dry bread) so don't pay - simply get something from one of the many cafe's around. A great place to stay just a short metro/walk from the main tourist traps.",
            "This is a great little hotel just a few blocks from Notre Dame. The rooms are small, as everyone has mentioned, but they are clean and very comfortable. The bed linens are especially nice. The front desk was wonderful, helpful, friendly and their dinner recommendations were very good. The location is really great. You are just two blocks from Place Mufftarde, which has lots of great restaurants and pubs. There are two Metro lines within two blocks and you are only a short walk to the center of the Latin Quarter, the Louvre and Luxenbourg Gardens. The train to the airport is a short walk as well. There are great and affordable restaurants all around this location. This hotel has the largest showers we have found in Europe, a real tub! Nice towels, too. This is super little hotel in Paris. We will definitely return.",
            "I decided to stay at Saint Christophe for my first trip to Paris for 7 nights. The location is super and an easy walk to many sites and cafes. It is walking distance to the highlights of the Latin Quarter but a few blocks away from the college crowd (a good thing). The hotel is 1 block to the metro (line 7) between the North and South exits of the \"Place Monge\" stop. The rooms on the top floor might be a tad smaller then others but they have a great balcony with room for two to enjoy the sights and sounds of metro Paris. This isn't the quietest hotel I have stayed out but it is a great value. The only reason I didn't rate the hotel a 5 is that the staff while very friendly wasn't able to offer much advice on sights or suggestions. Also, free wifi in the lobby and/or rooms would have been nice but the free use of a computer in the lobby was convenient. There is an internet cafe only a block away if you need to print anything such as boarding passes. I suggest bringing your own soap and shampoo or buying it down the street.",
            "Hotel is in a good location near a metro stop and only a short five/ten minute walk to the water bus. The pantheon is also only a ten minute walk away. Plenty of bars and restaurants close by and not too badly priced Receptionist was very helpful. Rooms were clean and noise was not a problem. Breakfast was a little cramped with not enough tables for the guests however this was the only real downside. Food consisted of the usual offering of croissants and jam although cereals and fruit juice were also available. All in all I would stay here again as the location is good, the rooms comfortable and clean and the price very good for Paris.",
            "What friendly people. I met the reception staff and the breakfast staff and couldn't have asked for more helpful people. The room was spotlessly clean and the shower was the best. There were no down-sides. only plus-sides. I will most certainly be booking in again.",
            "Stayed 4 nights at hotel and recommend Hotel Saint Christophe to those traveling to Paris who are looking for a reasonable price in a great location. While room for a single person was relatively small, it was comfortable and clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Plus hotel stay included a great breakfast each morning...juice, coffee, cereal, yogurt, great croissant and other breads. The hotel, which is 6 floors, does have a lift. Best of all is the location....right in the latin quarter and a block from a metro station (Place Monge). I highly recommend this hotel.",
            "The hotel was excellent and close to the Metro Station, which allowed easy access throughout Paris and to Versailles. My wife and I spent over a week and the hotel was very comfortable and clean, the towels and hand towels were also fine. There is a 110 volt outlet in the bathroom that can be used for shaving or recharging the digital camera, as well as a built-in hair dryer. There is local nightlife 2 blocks away with many bars and restaurants that are economically priced. We walked to the Arc de Triumph in about three hours, stopping along the way for lunch and sight seeing. The staff also helped with booking shows and dinners. I highly recommend this hotel.",
            "My wife and I stayed here in early March. Very friendly staff, and the room though small was pleasant and clean. The room included a refrigerator (part with mini-bar items which we ignored) with room for your own snack or lunch supplies. This is a small hotel - about 5 rooms per floor. The elevator is small as well (2 adults and two suitcases filled it) and the elevator is up one step from the lobby. Breakfast was very nice with bread, croissants, cereal, milk, cheese, yoghurt, plus coffee/tea/hot chocolate. The staff was also very helpful in arranging a shuttle to the airport (New Shuttle was the company) for 17 euros each if two people travel together. Check out the wonderful market a block away at Place Monge (7:00 AM-about 2:00) on Weds, Fri, and Sun according to my guide book. Fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese, jams, other foods, and some crafts and jewelry. If you are traveling to or from either airport and have very little luggage you can take the RER B train directly to Luxembourg stop, about 5-6 blocks away. I did not use this station, and don't know if it has an escalator, but most Metro stations we used required using stairs. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.",
            "I booked this hotel based on reviews on trip advisor. There certianly isn't anything wrong with the hotel, it's in a great location, it's clean, breakfast was included in the rate. Rooms are quite small by american standards, but that's to be expected so. Based on all the great reviews I just expexted a little bit of a spark that wasn't there. Everything was just adequate and average, but didn't quite live up hype",
            "This hotel is in a nice, typical Parisian neighbourhood, conveniently close to the Quartier Latin and the St. Germain area, but being just slightly off the main touristic trails it allows you to absorb some of the real life of the city. The cafes and boulangeries on Rue Monge give you plenty of opportunities to eat well, sip your cafe au lait and watch Parisian life happening in front of your eyes. We stayed in a corner room, which is quite roomy by Paris standards. It was clean, light, and comfortable. The staff is very polite and helpful. The free WiFi access is a huge asset. All in all, it definitely merits its high rating on tripadvisor. On the negative side: The double bed is a bit small for two, or at least compared to what i am normally used to. The walls are thin, so we heard the baby in the next room crying from time to time, hence the lower rating for sleep quality. But I guess this is normal in a three star category in Paris. Anyways, despite these slight inconveniences, i would definitely stay there again, and would not hesitate to recommend this place to others.",
            "My husband and I returned after spending 10 nights at this hotel! The location is great, located just on the tip of the Latin Quarter. The bed was tiny, and I did have a sore back most of the trip from the mattress, which was quite worn. Our room was nice however, very clean and lots of hot water! The location was somewhat noisy, some kind of construction going on now outside the windows but that is not anyone's fault.The coffee was not very good, but across the street they make a great Coffee and the bakery is delicious! My main complaint is regarding an argument about the phone. They stated that there were no charges for using the phone with our AT&T card, yet upon check out they charged us over 80 Euro's! We are seasoned travellers and this has never happened. They refuse to take off the charges so that is a bummer.",
            "A lot of things have already been said, but I thought this was a great hotel for our first trip to Paris, although I don't have anything to compare it to. The staff was friendly and very nice. I was prepared to be staying in a closet, but I thought the rooms were a good size, I've stayed in smaller rooms in the US. The rooms were also very clean, and clean every day we stayed. The bathroom was small, but probably normal for Paris. Having the mini fridge was very handy. The location was great, being close to the Place Monge metro station. The area is also not very touristy which we enjoyed despite being tourists. We had to give our key to the staff when we left, but we never saw the front office unattended so we felt the keys were safe. The elevator was the smallest one I've ever seen, I'm a fairly big guy and we piled in with one of the cleaning ladies which was a good laugh. I would definitely stay here if we went back.",
            "After reading the reviews on this site about this hotel, i expected something better. BUT really i cannot fathom WHY anyone would call this a good hotel. 1. The room- Small ( yes i know its europe) and clean BUT there was this MUSTY smell that just seemed to persist. 2. The lack of Airconditioning - This presented and interesting paradox. You could open the rather large windows BUT you let in all the road noises and of course, everyone can see you after your shower. I am not kidding about this. The temprature in the room would soar if the windows were closed. There is a small tower fan in the room that did little. NO cieling fans. 3. Breakfast - Very functional, Orange juice, tea, cornflakes, croissants, yoghurt is what you can expect. Its not the breakfast but WHERE it was served which created the problem. The basement was HOT and small. There were 6 tables in all and at best only 13-15 could fit into it. Not something i want to look forward to in the morning. The GOOD thing was the location- its next to two metros - Place Monge and Cardinal Lemoine. Lots of small bistros nearby BUt its not value for money( in my opinion)",
            "we stayed in room 31 and it was more than adequate in fact it was much larger than expected. I suspect however that the room could be unbearable in the summer as there is no airconditioner. the hotel is in a great location with the metro less than 100' away all of the staff were helpful except for the night clerk who was a complete jerk. he was always to busy to answer questions and screwed up our taxi to the airport. not only did the taxi not show up on time, it wasn't a taxi when it did show up. it and ended up costing 65 euro which is more than a regular taxi. worst yet, when we ordered the taxi for 4:45 am so that we would get to CDG by 5:30 am (2 hours before our flight) he didn't tell us that the airport did not open until 6:00 am. we could have slept for 1/2 hour more",
            "My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and would definitely recommend it . The hotel was very clean and was just what we expected of a parisian hotel. The rooms were small but this is the norm in Paris. The bathroom was very clean and modern. Lovely to have full length windows that opened fully.All the staff we met were very friendly and the receptionist was very helpful. My husband had asked them to arranged some flowers for me which they had in the room upon our arrival,.They were beautiful and just what my husband had suggested. We had breakfast once and this was fine, all fresh and plenty. We loved the winding staircase. The location is perfect. Metro 1 minute away. Shops just around the corner, including a wonderful bakery. On Sunday we discovered a great little market in the square. Notre Dame is a lovely stroll away, 15 mins, and the park at the end of the road is lovely. It includes gardens and a menagerie. Didnt expect to see red pandas in the middle of Paris! All in all a wonderful trip helped by a great hotel.",
            "We stayed for two nights at St Christophe and it is literally 100 metres from the Metro. It is also well located in a very safe area of Paris and there are many inexpensive eateries and bars just a stones throw away from the Hotel. The reception staff were helpful and spoke fluent English which was important for us as we spoke minimal French! The rooms were smallish but i suspect this is standard for Paris. They still had everything that was needed and you can open up the windows into your room so you can look out into the street. We would highly recommend this place due to its perfect location.",
            "My moter in-law booked our rooms online without a problem. She noted that we were arriving late. Staff had no problems with our delayed arrival. The cab ride from CDG for the four of us was reasonable. Staff was incredibly nice. Tolerant of my French, but fluent in English too. Our room was on the top floor. My in-laws' room was on the fifth floor. Our bathroom was beautiful. it did not have a bathtub, but was beautifully appointed and quite large. The coffered and lower ceilings of our room made it feel a touch small for the two of us. With that said though, my in-laws room on the lower floor felt roomier and the bathtub made for an even nicer room. I would recommend a fourth or fifth floor room. Not a sixth floor room. The bedding needs to be replaced and updated as it was lackluster. The bed itself and the pillows were good though. We slept with the windows openand were quite comfortable in late September. It got noisy at various points in the evening, but that is to be expected in Paris. It didn't prevent me from sleeping. Breakfast was served in the basement and it was quite warm down there. Breakfast was functonal. Although we would stay there again, we would give a more enthusiastic review if bedding were updated and rooms were better aired out as we found all the other aspects to be agreeable.",
            "Let me start with the no so good stuff. We stayed at the St Christophe for 3 nights from the World Cup final date onward. The weather was hot (30 degrees plus) and humid. We were given a room facing the street that was hot and, once Spanish celebrations started, very noisy. We asked if other rooms were available and the hotel staff, very obligingly, moved us to an interior room on the 5th floor. End of noise. Heat, however, remained an issue. (The hotel is not air conditioned). We slept with a fan running and windows open (into an interior well between buildings.) It was still a little uncomfortable. Now for the good stuff. This is an EXCELLENTLY run hotel with lovely staff in a very convenient location, close to the botanic garden, the Metro and a moderate walk (about a flat 1km) to the Latin Quarter. The staff (esp the lovely Adelaide) met our every request pleasantly and efficiently. We're sure that, in more moderate temperatures the hotel would have been very comfortable. Breakfast was a slightly above average continental. If the hotel were to improve anything, it might be to add fruit and a wider range of pastries in this area. Rooms are a good size, beds are comfortable (remember - we experienced 2 rooms) and bathrooms are clean, a reasonable size and have good hot water pressure. When we visit Paris again (hopefully), we'll happily book the St Christophe again.",
            "The St Christophe is located about a 10-minute walk to the French Quarter and across the street from the Place Monge metro station. Our room was on the fourth floor with a view of the lively street below. The room was a decent size with a minibar and a double (not queen) bed, which we found to be a little cramped. The bathroom had a tub with the nicest shower we encountered on our trip. The area is loaded with excellent restaurants, food shops and nearby to a coin laundry which came in very handy! The desk staff was very helpful with helping us with our local transportation needs and restaurant recommendations. The breakfast was a typical Parisian continental with baked goods, cereal, yogurt and cafe au lait. A nice bonus was that the nearby metro was on the line that takes you straight to the Lourvre."

            "I stayed at the Hotel Giorgione in July this year with a girl friend, I agree with the previous review, the address given on the website we booked through [--] was confusing and we ended up getting of the water bus at Rialto bridge, walking over the bridge (with 13 pound suitcases) only to find it was on the other side!! And it was HOT. For reference, Ca d'Oro is closer. We stayed in a twin bedroom on the second floor (265 if memory serves), it was small but well appointed with plenty of storage space. There is free air-con in the room which was nice on an evening. Rialto Bridge only 2 mins away and St Marks Square in walking distance, the receptionist said it was a 20 min walk but we found a short cut of only 8 or so mins (although I can't remember it now!). The staff were very courteous and helpful, the latest we got back was 1am and there was a night receptionist for entry and keys. Breakfast was a typical Continental affair but plentiful. Afternoon tea (served by the decorative pool from 2-5) was a lovely touch and just what we needed after a hot day of sightseeing. The location was great, I'm glad we didn't stay in St Marks Square as it was way cheaper and we explored more of the city. We went for a friends wedding (which was beautiful), if you are going for the same reason the Town Hall is just by Rialto Bridge and to the left. Would definately stay there again.",
            "Wow! Very nice hotel with an excellent breakfast. Super Staff! They knew me by name on the first night. The outdoor courtyard is beautiful and a great place to have a glass of wine in the early evening before diner. Great restaurant just down the street too. Met my expectations but was very expensive, but then again what isn't in Venice.",
            "To be fair, this is not the sort of accomodation we prefer (too many rooms, more like a real hotel than a quaint inn) but we traveled to Venice at the last minute and felt lucky to get the reservation. When I called, I was quoted a \"special\" last minute rate of 140 euros per night and given a confirmation number. We are seasoned travelers, but when we checked in I failed to verify the rate and on checkout, we were charged 180 euros per night. The desk clerk was very arrogant and told me it was impossible to get a room there for 140 euros and that I had misunderstood the price. He picked up the desk phone and was going to call someone to set me straight, but I just smiled and told him that was OK, no big deal. Since I had no printed confirmation, I thanked him and mentally calculated the price of that lesson learned. I was absolutely quoted 140 euros a night and the desk clerk most certainly had been through that drill before. Besides the rate problem, I felt this hotel was overpriced and more fluff than stuff. Our room was miniscule. The refrigerator was not working, the air was turned off, which shouldn't have mattered, but the mosquitos were bad and it was a very hot room. They had one computer for the internet and it was not working. I could not recommend this hotel.",
            "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it really was a fantastic find. The location was perfect, being 5 min from the rialto bridge and close to lots of bars, restaurants and gondalas. The breakfast was varied by italian standards, with eggs, hot meats as well as the usual continental options. The hotel is decorated beautifully and we loved sitting out in the courtyard sipping the house bellinis they were gorgeous. The rooms were a good size and very clean if there was to be one small grumble it would be that there are no ironing facilities and when we asked for an iron were told that \"these buildings are wooden, it would be a hazard\" which confused us as there was no ban on hair straighteners ?? All in all a lovely hotel",
            "This hotel is 5 minutes from a Vaporetta (water bus) stop on the Grand Canal, with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants nearby. It is also within easy walking distance (5-10 minutes) of the Rialto area and St Mark's Square. The reception area and lounge is very grand with several Murano glass chandeliers, comfortable chairs and free WiFi. The reception staff (Italian) were extremely friendly and spoke good English and French (possibly other languages). Breakfast was lovely: plentiful with hot, cold, savoury and sweet items to suit all tastes. In the afternoon free tea and coffee is served in the lounge, and if you fancy a cake with it, there are bakeries less than 3 minutes away selling delicious cakes and biscuits. Our room was comfortable with sufficient drawer and wardrobe space, free safe and adjustable heating. The bathroom had both bath and shower and decent smellies. The sheets and towels were changed every day. My only small complaint is that our room was too warm, but we opened the shutters to cool things down. Our view was of the internal garden area where I believe they serve breakfast in the summer. It looked very nice. When I return to Venice this hotel will be top of my list.",
            "We stayed at the Giorgione for two night in the middle of April. Hotel was clean and conveniently located. Service was very good and the breakfast was exceptional. This is definitely a hotel that I would stay at again. The only issue was that, although it was hot, the A/C was not turned on yet, so we needed to sleep with our windows open. Mosquitos were not terrible, but we did wake up with mosquitos in our room every morning. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay.",
            "We stayed 3 nights in October - the Hotel is definitely a sanctuary from the hustle & bustle of Venice. Yes, the room was small, but it was spotlessly clean, and the staff were very friendly, much friendlier than in Florence - the front desk staff even taught me how to ask for my room number in Italiano. They also directed us to the public boat to get to Murano, rather than pushing any service they might have been getting commission from - which surprised me after Florence. Breakfast was fine, great range of cheeses, meats and breads, great coffee and very friendly service, especially when I ordered a cappucino, rather than Cafe Americain...and since when is fruit salad a breakfast food anyway? When in Europe, eat European!",
            "Everything is expensive in Venice, so we weren't shocked by the $300 a night expense. Clean, light, airy rooms. Substantial hot breakfast. Free internet access and a pool table. Helpful staff. And the location is ideal since it is less than ten minutes to the Grand Canal waterbus stop. Many restaurants in the area as well as shopping and a grocery. This was the most delightful hotel we stayed in during our month in Europe.",
            "We stayed at the Giorgione at the beginning of Nov2009. During the check-in the staff was professional, they were quick (anyway, I missed some small personal something) and then we have been shown our room: a beautiful room with authentic furniture. Flat TV, mini bar, convenient bathroom - all was perfect. Breakfast was just OK - good for one or two days, but if you stayed longer it could be boring. The hotel was easy-to-find, really just 80 m walks from Piazza SS.Apostoli - a very good location to discover Venezia by foot and vaporetto.",
            "We started our trip to Italia at this hotel. It was a great location. One of the front desk staff was quite helpful and one was not! The rooms were adequate size and nicely decorated. The bathroom also was fine. We did have transport to/from the airport arranged in advance by water taxi and that was worth the extra money since it was just my daughter and myself traveling. Venice can be a little confusing on first arrival so this was a nice luxury. People were very friendly all throughout and we allowed ourselves to get lost a bit which was very easy! We loved the quaintness and quiet of Burano (the lace making island) more than the busy, tourism of Murano (for glass). It was a lovely couple nights' stay.",
            "This hotel is a hidden gem in Venice. It's conveniently situated close to Fondamente Nuevo (on blue line boat from airport) or Ca d'Oro on Grand Canal. Our room was small but fine. In Venice you're not going to spend too much time in the room after all! Breakfast was a buffet and there was plenty of choice. Our rate included breakfast - booked through Hotels.com. The hotel also had free internet access if you used their laptop next to reception.",
            "This is one of the best spots for visiting Venice! You are a ten minute walk to St. Marks, a five minute walk to the Rialto Bridge, and a 10 minute walk to the vaporetto station to the outer islands. It is also convenient because it's not on a major or crowded vaporetto stop, the Ca d'oro. The rooms are quiet and comfortable. The bathrooms could be a little cleaner for a four star hotel, but they were fine. The price is a little high, but that's how it is in Venice. Everything is a little high. The buffet breakfast was delicious with hot items and a wide assortment of other good eats. Overall it's a good hotel, and if you are visiting Venice, you should try and find a place in Venice.",
            "I stayed overnight at the Giorgione Hotel in November 2011 for business purposes. I had a double room for single use. It was clean, spacious and quiet. View overlooking the swimming pool. Mini bar, flat screen T.V., double basins in bathroom, large entrance and comfortable bed. The breakfast was good, and the staff pleassant and courteous....pity about the canned fruit. The location is amazing.....will definitely stay again.",
            "I lost my wife in January and needed a place I had never been before to look back and forward at the same time. There is no place better to reflect than Venice in my book. This hotel provided a place for me to do that. Agood start with the typical Italian breakfast that my wife treasured on other Italian visits: delicious brewed ice tea (with ice) and biscuits in the aftrnoon to break the 5 o'clock heat. Little things like that: beautiful tile and shiny bright fixtures in the bathroom. Great places to sit and reflect inside and outside, off the beaten track just the right amount, still close to everything. I am into authentic, and that is what I found. Room keys I had never seen the likes of before, pool table, a small bar staffed all evening, things like that made me feel I was getting a good taste of big history.",
            "We spent four nights at Hotel Giorgione. It was clean, had a great staff, and was in an excellent location. Near the Rialto Bridge and an easy vapporeto station. Lots of resturants in the area and on the main drag, so lots of foot traffic. BUT, its about 100 yards for all of that so its quite, but still easy to get to. Highly recommended.",
            "This wxas our 6Th stay in Venise and first time at the Giorgione Hotel. The location is very good, all walking distance and quiet. The service was really very good and some people at the reception just charming and very helpfull. Breakfast is good and we shall surely come back!!! Jacqueline from Paris",
            "Can we give this hotel 6 stars out of 5 ? Everything was perfect from check in to check out. The staff could not have been any nicer or more professional. Our standard room was more like a junior suite with a good sized sitting area downstairs and a bedroom upstairs. Breakfast offered a huge array of choices catering to every possible taste. The common areas are gorgeous where you can enjoy compimentary afternoon tea. And what a joy it was to come back to the room after a long day of sightseeing and find a complimentary bottle of prosecco waiting for us on ice! Check in and out was quick and efficient and done with a smile. All this for a very reasonable price. We cannot imagine a better value.",
            "We just returned from a six night stay in Venice and our stay at the Giorgione Hotel was a tremendous pleasure! I had stayed here in May 2001, and so when the search began for a second visit to Venice, I kept my previous stay here in mind, but I did want to search other options. When I weighed location and price, I decided to go with my gut and reserved our stay at a tried and true hotel. What an excellent decision!! Il Giorgione has remained absolutely pristine, gracious and a gem in a delightful little piazza close to everything you'd want. It is located right off Strada Nuova, a very bustling main thoroughfare and yet in the Campo SS Apostoli you are enveloped in everyday Venetian life, with a true neighborhood feeling. Easy to find (C\u00c3\u00a1 D'oro Vaporetto stop), 15 minute walk to Piazza San Marco, 5 minutes to Rialto, and yet quiet enough at night to relax and stroll in peace. The room was immaculate, spacious and flooded with light from windows facing a small canal and a flower laden side street. The front desk was staffed with really pleasant, professional people who always had time for questions and good recommendations. (There is a wonderful,repeat wonderful, restaurant just down the street and around a corner called La Vechia Cava.) Breakfast served either in the courtyard by a lovely fountain or inside in a very pretty room, was really nice with the typical buffet spread, yet each morning there were one or two selections that were different.The lobby is very prettily decorated in high Venetian fashion with alot of comfortable seating affording a pleasant spot to wind down and have a drink, coffee, etc. I highly recommend this hotel, would not hesitate to return as I consider it to have enhanced my visit to this magnificent city.",
            "We enjoyed our stay here! The service was second to none, although the rooms were a bit on the small side. There is a lovely courtyard and breakfast room, where we enjoyed a better then average meal every morning. This hotel is in a perfect setting. We'd come again in a heartbeat!",
            "We stayed at the Giorgione for a few days while we were in Venice. The location is not bad and the rooms are comfortable. The bathrooms were not great but they weren't filthy. The staff was also just ok, they weren't very enthusiastic about fulfilling requests but they didn't complain either. We got a great rate with the breakfast buffet included which made our stay here palatable. Buffet had a large selection of hot and cold foods and served in large room with adjoining terrace with a nice fountain. If you can get this place at a steal then it might be worth it since Venice can get very expensive. I recommend this place ONLY if you can get a good rate. DO NOT PAY RACK RATE or you will be disappointed.",
            "The location of the hotel was good, close to water transport, good shopping and lovely restaurants. Hotel staff are very well trained, especially at the front desk where the check in and reception staff are efficient and knowledgable with a very friendly disposition. Highly recommended and will definitely return to the Hotel Giorgione.",
            "What a great find this is. (Ignore the review of 18 August). We had 2 rooms on the very top floor with private little terraces amongst the roof tops ! All rooms in Italian hotels are small, so if you are an American looking for size rather than quality then this is not for you. Every one of the staff that we encountered had a cheery smile and went out of their way to help. Free PC in the lobby with snooker table and small bar with a delightful Indian barman. Breakfast in the courtyard next to the water feature and fountain in the sun was as romantic as it can get. Everywhere in Venice is hard to find the first time that you try so dont be put off....great location a minute or two from the Rialto bridge and a slow picturesque 10-15 minute amble to St Marks square. All you rock-an-rollers out there be warned...everyone in Venice is asleep by 10pm !..unlike France or Spain when people dont even think about going out until 10pm and midnight is not an unusual time to sit down for dinner....even with kids! A superb hotel in one of the most magical cities on earth...",
            "This is a very clean and well appointed hotel close to the Rialto Bridge but away from the crowds. The room we had was a little small but well equipped. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a treat. Venice is very expensive but the staff can recommend good value eating places. Our favourite was Casa Mia which was very close to the hotel: food was excellent and reasonably priced. It is off the tourist routes and used by the locals. Mr and Mrs B Prentis Eastbourne May 2007",
            "Location of the hotel is excellent, within walking distance of almost everything. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming, making it a very nice stay for my wife and me. as Venezia-first-timer I forgot the umbrella: the hotel will give you one. only (neglectable) downside: hotel rooms are very, very small, so don't bring more than one suitcase, it won't fit. highly recommended.",
            "This was my 5th visit to Venice and by far my favorite Hotel in Venice to date. The room was comfortable and roomy with a large bathroom w/tub. Breakfast was absolutely wonderful with a lot of choices. Eggs, ham, fruit, cereal, rolls were delicious. I can go on and on about it. I loved the lounge and 2:00 o'clock tea or coffee with cookies. Free WiFi was also a plus. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We only had reservations for 3 nights. They were able to get the 4th night for us at the same rate. I would like to explain my rating. Location: My Husband and I like the Canereggio area. It not as crowd as S.Marco. I only gave sleep quality a 4 only because I like a softer mattress and Italy doesn't do soft mattress.",
            "A friend and I stayed at the Wonderful Hotel Giorgione in Venice during our 3-stop tour of Italy 2 years ago. It was just perfect! The hotel is absolutly BEAUTIFUL and located in a great spot - not too close to the tourist attractions, but not too far that you have a long walk to see the sites. Its also close to the water taxi stop so you do not have a far walk with your luggage. The entire time we were in Venice it was raining but we didnt mind walking around with the large umbrellas the hotel provided for us. When we first arrived, my luggage didnt arrive with me. The hotel was kind enough to call the Airline and arrange for its delivery - which happened to come the night before I was to depart. The hotel serves a nice breakfast in their courtyard. And the rooms were spacious and pretty! There are several lounges in the lobby as well as internet access. I would definalty reccommend staying here if you are in Venice!",
            "Having worked hard over the years to secure decent accommodation at a fair price in Venice..I have finally succeeded. That is IT ! Won't consider anywhere else. Ideally situated..amazing service and fabulous breakfast. ......home from home - Will book the hotel before the flight in future to ensure I'm not disappointed and exposed to the risk of disappointment which pervades so many of the hotels who profess to be 3star but which aren't.",
            "Once you find this hotel, you'll be very pleased. The lobby features a beautiful Murano chandelier, along with a parlor where tea is served every afternoon. The rooms are quaint and clean, and we enjoyed a window with a flower box overlooking a quiet street. Complimentary breakfasts were wonderful. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the Rialto Bridge and San Marcos Square. There were plenty of shops, bakeries and restaurants nearby. The staff was warm and professional.",
            "This is a very beautiful place to stay in Venice. The place and the rooms are unique and the service is very good. Short walk (5 mins) from Fondamente Nove, where you can easily get a boat to and from Venice Marco Polo airport. There is no wifi in the rooms though and this is the only complaint, really. Must recommend restaurant Paradiso Perduto at Fondamenta de la Misericordia quite nearby.",
            "We stayed for three nights at the Hotel Giorgione in July. We found it by chance searching on a travel agent's site, and loved the pictures. The hotel is just as good as its website suggests. Our room was one of the cheaper ones, but had all that we would have wanted. Breakfast in the courtyard was wonderful, and there are plenty of places to sit and relax. Very close to the centre of Venice, and easy to get to from Marco Polo airport. Would definitely come back - but next time would like a roof-terraced room!",
            "I'll definitely stay at the Giorgione if I get to Venice again! It was easy to find from the Vaporetto (Ca D'Oro stop), even though we arrived on a rainy night. It was convenient walking distance to most anything (San Marco, Rialto, Vaporetto stops, etc). The hotel staff had superb customer service, especially Andrea our night desk clerk. He's fluent in 5 languages, so no worries. The breakfasts are wonderful, with a variety of choices of hot and cold items, including chocolate croissants that are delightful. There was plenty of fresh fruit, so there's something for all appetites. The hotel rooms have mini-refrigerators and there are a couple of small groceries nearby. Restaurants in Venice are pricey, often including charges just to sit. We bought cold cuts, breads, fruit, soft drinks and snacks so we could have modest meals...and save for a splurge dinner. There's a courtyard with tables/chairs, plus a large sitting area near the lobby, with clusters of couches/chairs/coffee tables so you can relax at the hotel outside the rooms. Our room was a little small...it is Europe...but with excellent amenities and extremely clean. Newspapers in multiple languages are provided in the downstairs seating area, and one common area computer is available for 30 minutes at a time. Tell Andrea we said hello!",
            "I enjoyed this hotel. It was charming, clean, and in a lovely area away from St. Mark's, but just a 10 minute walk from the action. The staff was courteous and helpful and the decor and amenities were better than expected. We were treated to a slice of local Venice life and impromptu music and singing at the Campo SS. Apostoli. Overall, a good value for Venice.",
            "Our three night stay was good. The junior members of staff were very attentive and hard working. Although the room was nice and appropriate for its period, it was on the ground floor with no view of anything. However, If you do not mind that it is an excellent location to stay and visit Venice.",
            "My wife and I stayed at the Giorgione Hotel for 3 nights in early July. We found it to be a great hotel, and would definitely stay there again if we returned to Venice. The spacious, traditionally decorated hotel is located in a great area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only about 20 minutes (at a leisurely pace) by foot to St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never know because you lose track of time when passing by many great shops, restaurants and other attraction while on your way there. While it is located in a fairly busy area, the hotel is just off a main square, so there is no noise or bustling crowds at night. For Europe, our hotel room would be considered fairly large. It was tastefully decorated, clean, with air conditioning (very important for Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s humidity!) TV, and lots of closet/desk space. The bathroom was large, even for North American standards with a bathtub that included a shower with great water pressure. The buffet breakfast was great (have it in the outside courtyard) with your standard continental choices, as well as eggs, bacon and sliced meats. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We inquired about taking the train to Verona for a day trip, and the desk clerk even printed us a schedule, and gave us tips as to which station was the closest. TIP: If arriving by the water taxi from the airport, the taxi may not stop at the Ca d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Oro stop (it stops at Rialto). If this is the case, please pay the 6.50 Euros to then take the Vaporetto (water bus) the one extra stop to the Ca d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Oro stop! Venice is a city with many, many mini foot bridges, all with steps. If you get off with your luggage at Ca d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Oro, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short, flat distance to the hotel. While Rialto stop is close distance-wise, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be dragging your luggage up and down the steps of many foot bridges on the way to the hotel. Buy your tickets for all at the airport. A wonderful hotel!",
            "This hotel was everything we had hoped for- old world charm but spotlessly clean (and quiet) room, great breakfast, ideal location and very helpful staff. When we mentioned that our booking included a free bottle of wine it was delivered to our door within minutes. As first time visitors to Venice we would highly recommend it.",
            "We stayed in a standard double room (one bed) for four nights in August at 110 Euro a night inlcuding tax, services and buffet breakfast. I booked throught the hotel's web site. The room was small but comfortable. The shower was a bit cramped, but I think we had one of the smaller rooms. The breakfast was good with a nice selection of breads, cereals, cold meats and cheeses, and fruit. We enjoyed eating in the courtyard next to the fountain. The staff at the reception desk was always pleasant and helpful and everyone spoke English. We ate dinner at the restaurant that goes by the same name as the hotel just a few feet from the hotel and had good meals.",
            "Hotel Giorgione was a great stay in Venice. The room was classic and we enjoyed the old-time feel to this hotel. The breakfast was amazing! The best we had during our trip. The staff was very accomodating. An easy walk from the bus stop.",
            "At my first time in Venice, I booked this hotel for me and my mother. It was really nice, the best during our stay, we liked the decoration of the room, but it is not that new (what could be a bad point for other travelers, although we liked this). The hotel is well located, but like all hotels in Venice: it's hard to find and from out outside doesn't look good. Once you get inside it's amazing and beautiful, we loved the \"patio\" inside, with the sculpture, and the breakfast was really nice. I just don't say it was excellent, because there are hotels that can be better with the same price (which is not cheap... but this is Venice! ).",
            "We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights on our Honeymoon. This charming hotel is a great representation of Venice and its spirit. It is located in a quiet area with great shops (many of the products sold in this area are the same as the ones sold downtown but are much LESS expensive) and restaurants and is within walking distance of every attraction. Our room was a junior suite with a private patio. The room is bigger than average for the area and it was cleaned every day. The staff was also helpful and polite. The breakfast was excellent and make sure to try the jelly croissants! There is seating inside or outside (there is also a nice seating area outside on a second level overlooking a decoration pool). There is iced tea and cookies served in the afternoon. The bar serves many drinks and a pool table is nearby. The lobby has a large seating area perfect for taking pictures. Internet access is also available. Make sure to see theatre, opera and definitely go on a Gondola ride (it is best at night as the canals are quiet). A guide book and a map will make your stay enjoyable as it will be easy to locate attractions. We used \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Top 10 de Venise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which detailed all the main attractions spread over a 7 day stay. Dining in Venice is an experience all by itself. The flavors and the quality of the food will enchant you in all the areas of this great city! Pastas are simply delightful. We will definitely return to this hotel the next time we visit Venice.",
            "Ignore the last review. Clearly they had a bad experience and havent actually stayed in every hotel in Europe which they seem to suggest. Yes it is expensive. Thats the only reason it didnt get a 5 from me. As I understand it Venetian hotels are generally expensive - its a supply and demand thing. The public areas are excellent, the staff very helpful, our room was great. It was our first wedding anniversary and they had put a bottle of prosecco in there, nice touch. The room decor looked traditional venetian, as far as I could tell. Breakfast was above average, in a nice room. Location was excellent. 5 minute walk to the Rialto and 10 minutes to St Marks, yet in a quiet \"off the beaten track street.\" Would stay here again and would recommend.",
            "Have just spent 4 nights at this beautiful hotel. Very helpful, friendly, English-speaking staff at Reception. Clean comfortable room opening onto picturesque terrace with fountain. Excellent breakfast with good selection of food. Very central location - near to St. Marks Square, Rialto Bridge and boats to the islands. Water taxi dropped us one minute walk from hotel. Safe and hair dryer in room. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and will recommend it to others. Only downside was the long wait for hot water in shower.",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Giorgione for 4 nights last week. The rooms were clean and comfortable and nicely decorated. The bed linen and towels were changed every day. The breakfast was good with a good selection of hot and cold dishes, although the breakfast room staff were a bit dour. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. There was tea, coffee and biscuits served in the lounge every afternoon which was nice to come back to after being out all day. The hotel's location was excellent. It was in a quiet area with only a short walk to Rialto and St Marks Square, and very convenient for the vaporetto stops both at Fondamente Nuove and Ca'D'Oro. There was a nice courtyard which would be good to sit in and have breakfast in in summer time. The hotel also had a well-stocked bar. There were some very reasonably priced restaurants nearby. I would not hesitate to return to this hotel if I was in Venice again.",
            "The hotel was found easily from the website directions from the airport via water bus. The staff were attentive yet only when you needed help. The classic room was quite small but very comfortable. The receptionist was quite expert in helping us with advice as to how to get round Venice.. The hotel was in a quiet district of Venice with excellent food just around the corner for the evening out. Breakfast was ok but nothing out of the ordinary. The al-fresco breakfast in the the courtyard was delightful. A strong positive - recommended by our travel agent as a good thing.",
            "My wife and I stayed here 3 nights during our honeymoon and couldn't have asked for a nicer place. The rooms were clean and spacious. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful in providing directions and recommending/making reservations for restaurants. There is complimentary tea in the afternoons and during the evenings they have a nice quiet courtyard to sit in with your drinks from the bar. The area that the hotel is in is quiet in the evenings but still has several dining options close by. The 2 nearest vaparetto stops are about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel which can get you to any part of Venice or to the other islands depending on which stop you go to. If you take a water taxi then it can let you off at a different canal stop which is only about a 2 minute walk to get to the hotel. We will definitely be staying here the next time we are in Venice.",
            "What a beautiful hotel. The room was well appointed and the bathroom modern. Even a heated towel rack. The breakfast was generous and included eggs and bacon. The location in the Cannaregio area was out of the touristy area, but an easy walk to the main sights, and we only got lost once. We ate dinner at a nearby restaurant the Veeia Cavana. This was the best meal we had on our trip.",
            "My husband and I just returned from our trip to Italy and our first stop was Venice. The Hotel Giorgione was fabulous! The place itself was very charming and clean and the staff was extremely polite and helpful. They served a delicious breakfast every morning, which was just what we needed to get us started on our busy day of sightseeing. We enjoyed relaxing in the courtyard with a cocktail in the afternoon before heading out for the evening. Very close to everything, especially the Rialto Bridge. I would highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here on our next trip to Venice!",
            "We stayed at the Giorgone on our recent stay in Venice. The staff was very helpful with all our dinner reservation requests and the questions we had about Venice. A beautiful courtyard in the center which is great place to enjoy the ample breakfast the hotel provides. Our room was a good size, especially for Venice, with good A/C and water, which is not always a given in Italy. Great locale, close to the Rialto bridge, but on a queit side street. We would defiantley stay again if we went back to Venice.",
            "We were very pleased with our choice. This is a beautiful hotel great atmosphere. There is a lovely garden room where you can have tea and cookies in the afternoon and rest after a day of sightseeing. The breakfast is simple but plentiful. If you follow the directions the hotel gives it is very easy to find the hotel. It is away from the crowds but within walking distance to every attraction. If you come to Venice the object is to walk, you can't get lost and it is easy to get around. We would stay there again if we came back.",
            "My husband and I stayed here on a trip to Venice, and we were really happy with our choice. The hotel is affordable and in a great location - easy to walk to the train station as well as to all of the great sights and water taxi stops. The staff is amazing - the front desk attendant must have spoken at least 4 languages, which was really impressive and useful. There are great, free breakfasts each morning and an afternoon tea each day. I loved the room, too - ours had an awesome exposed wood beam ceiling. It was beautiful! If you're headed to Venice and want to stay somewhere great, this is your place!",
            "Hotel was quite old world but clean and efficient with interesting decoration. Our room was quiet and overlooked a courtyard. We got our internet to work in the room, although they said it was only meant to work in the lobby. Staff was friendly and helpful. Easy walking distance to ferry wharf. Breakfast was good. Our room service hot water for tea tasted fishy, but I think this may be a Venice problem rahter than the fault of the hotel. I did not particularly like Venice, as it was an overcrowded tourist trap with high prices, but I would stay at this hotel again.",
            "Very pleasant hotel, room nicely decorated and cosy. The staff is very helpfull, and the lounge a nice place to stay for a while. We also liked very much the situation, a little bit away from the most touristic parts of Venise, so that we could discover some more quiet places in the city ; the St Mark place is only 15 minutes walking though. The bad point were the bathroom, which looks old and sad, and of course the prices but it was Carnaval time !",
            "We had a great stay at this hotel. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff very helpful and friendly. The location was convenient. It was an easy walk to the Rialto Bridge or to the water bus (Vaperetto). The location is quiet at night. Minuses were that the room was a bit hot at night. Also the bathroom was not on the same level as the bed. This meant occassionally negotiating the stairs at night.",
            "Just returned from Venice, found the hotel easily from the Vaporetti, we were able to walk to Rialto bridge, St Marks Square and the station easily, also enjoyed exploring the quieter 'streets' behind the hotel, real Venice. Helpful reception staff, lovely breakfast and comfortable room, oldy worldy style not everyones cup of tea. Would recommend this hotel.",
            "This was a great place to stay in Venice on our honeymoon. It was so peaceful, especially out on the balcony. There's no canal, not much of a view in this area, but its a nice place. There is a pool table, a large sitting area, a bar, a courtyard, etc. on the ground floor. It was pretty easy to reach from the airport. I would recommend it.",
            "This is an rather impressive old style hotel with nice and friendly staff and oppulent interiors. This is exactly what you want in Venice to feel the atmosphere of the city. There's an outdoor rooftop restaurant and views are magnificent. Very good offer for its price and a good reputation - the hotel is widely known in Italy and abroad. There is a nice little wine bar to the right when you leave the hotel, just across the road",
            "when we arrived at the hotel, staff were very nice and immediatly showed us to our room, on first impression it looked very nice, it was a two storey room decorated in typical venetian style, there was one small window with no views and the downstairs had a settee,television and fridge the bathroom was very close to the bed and a tiny built in wardrobe and no drawers, we stayed 1 night in the room and both felt a bit chlostaphobic and the stairs were very close to the bed, we requested to be moved into another room the next day as we did not like the layout as it felt quite 'pokey' the other room was lovely, spacious and airey with two bathrooms and not next to the bed. breakfast was ok, however seemed to cater more for the europeans cakes, pastries cold meat, only hot food was scrambled eggs and chopped bacon,very clean and hospitable service, food was much better in the local restaurants although a bit expensive, remember to ask for the set menu for lunch very good quality and value for money.",
            "We stayed at this hotel for two nights in November. The staff were all really lovely and very helpful. Unlike the other reviews, our room was on the small side. We had twin beds but there was no gap between them and not much room to walk around them but that's the luck of the draw. The room and bathroom were both clean but our room did not get made up on the second day while we were out. We also had issues with heating but luckily for us it was cold. The hotel is in a great location and we were able to walk from the train station, about 20 minutes lugging big suitcases. The hotel booked a water taxi for our trip to the airport at the end of our trip. The breakfast was quite ordinary. There is no wifi available at this hotel, the only internet is a laptop set up in a realy small phone booth next to reception. Overall a good stay and would stay here again.",
            "We arrived around 9PM and were greeted by an extremely friendly face. We were shown to our rooms by a man that could not speak a word of English and we could not speak a word of Italian. However, we somehow communicated and were shown to our two Junior Suites. Since we expected our rooms to be smaller in Europe, we were not disappointed. We actually loved our room, 219, since it had two small bathrooms and was larger than our other junior suite in which our children stayed. Each day we were greeted with a smile and Bongiorno. We felt that the location was wonderful since it was off the beaten track and was within walking distance of everything, St Marks, Rialto Bridge, shops, restaurants, etc. We loved the quiet location after the many tourist that we encountered in all of the other locations. It was a breath of fresh air in a city that had so many summer tourists!",
            "Overall, we were very happy with our stay at Hotel Giorgione. It was reasonably priced compared to some of the other hotels we looked at in Venice. However, be aware that the hotel has a wide range of rooms. if you pay more, the more upgraded rooms are much nicer. I stayed in a standard room for single use and it was clean but sparse and small. The bed wasn't very comfortable, but I've found that to be true for a lot of older hotels in Europe. My parents had the next higher level room and it was a good size and very elegant. The breakfast was good, the lobby and the patio are gorgeous. The hotel is less than a five minute walk from the Ca D'Oro vaporetto stop and an easy 10 minute walk away from St. Mark's square.",
            "We stayed for 3 nights and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is a short (5-10min.) water bus ride from the train station. It is located just off of the square where the bus stops. It is about 150 yards from the nearest canal so if you want to stay directly on the canal you shouldn't stay here. The lobby is very nicely decorated with several little rooms to sit in and relax. They have a small bar area and offer free afternoon tea in one of the rooms off the garden. Also included was a nice breakfast which had several hot menu items as well as the usual continental stuff. There are 3 good restaurants within a 1-2 minutes walk and the main walkway is just a few steps down the way. I would definitely suggest staying here to anyone as it is very clean, convenient, and moderately priced considering how nice it is.",
            "My 83 year old mother has dreamed of going to Venice. Having been before, I knew that a good hotel would be essential to her enjoying this beautiful city. Boy, did we luck out when we found the Giorgione! The hotel is exactly what you dream of-- all the charms of old world Venice with the comforts of current day-- air conditioning, technology, and best of all- a FANTASTIC STAFF! These people go all the way to ensure guests have a great stay. Our room was fantastic-- located right off of a beautiful courtyard with a fountain, flowers, and little birds-- the perfect place to enjoy breakfast or relax in after a day of sightseeing. The hotel is very quiet- we didn't hear a sound at night. The breakfast room is beautiful-- and the selection of food is wonderful. The hotel is located off of a wonderful square where there are restaurants, trees, and benches to sit and enjoy the atmosphere. It was the perfect balance of access to the waterbus, and tourist sights while also being out of the crowds. There are some great places nearby to get meals, gelato, and a glass of wine. Around the corner is a coop grocery store. The direct waterbus to murano and burano was just a few blocks behind the hotel-- saving a lot of time. We really felt like we were able to experience the \"true venice\" while staying at the Giorgione. Having stayed in other hotels in venice, i HIGHLY recommend the Giorgione.",
            "Stayed in this Hotel for 4 nights August 07. found the hotel to be excellent in service,cleanliness and decor. Shower gel , soap etc in rooms. Safe in rooms, even umbrellas!! Reception staff friendly.Gave out a map of Venice with Hotel phone no. on to guests Breakfasts were plentiful with good coffee and tea self service. It is only 5mins walk from the Ca'D'oro vaporetto stop. (Take No 1 vaporetto from the Piazzale Roma) It is also only 10mins from Rialto Bridge You are able to leave your luggage safely stored on the day of your flight until you are ready to go to the airport . Note -do not eat at the restuarant with the outdoor seating in the middle of the square just down from the hotel,it is not good.",
            "My wife and I stayed for three nights at the end of March 2006, having booked through Expedia for c.60GBP per night. We were extremely happy with the hotel and have no complaints at all. We found the staff to be welcoming, helpful and efficient - we were shown around the hotel and to our room by a polite young lady. Extra pillows arrived only minutes after requesting them. Breakfast was included in the deal and was very nice; all the usual fruit, cereals, croissants etc as well as come nice hot food (bacon and egg) too. Only one minor disappointment - you have to pay extra for fruit juice. Never mind, the breakfast room is done out beautifully and the food was of a high standard. The reception, lounge and breakfast rooms are all very pleasant. The billiards table is free, as is the internet access. There's a nice lounge where complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits are available in the afternoon. There's a small courtyard too. Our room, although quite small, was fine for a short break; the bed was a little hard but everything was clean, and the wardrobe contained a safe which was free to use. The location of the hotel is great; two minutes walk from the Ca d'oro vaporetto station on the grand canal. It's maybe 10 or 15 mins walk to Piazza San Marco. The hotel is tucked away up a side street where it's nice and quiet. There are plenty of restaurants close by. To be honest, Venice is so small that nowhere is *too* far away... I can't fault it for the money. Sure, there are fancier hotels in Venice, but you pay through the nose for them. The Giorgione is clean, safe, well-positioned and offers good value for money. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",
            "When we called and asked for a double room, they told us that 220 euro was their best price and it included a tour to Murano. We gave them our credit card info and after we arrived and checked in to our TINY, LOUD all night room, we checked their website and the prices there were 50 euro cheaper. I asked for that rate and they told me that the rate was changed five minutes after we checked in. We then told them that we wanted to book the tour they acted like they didn't know what we were talking about. From that point on, the staff was very rude and unhelpful. Don't waste your money here, there are lots of better and cheaper places in Venice.",
            "Venice hotel rates seem to fluctuate a lot, and I've found that a good way to track down a deal is to look at sites like kayak and sidestep and see who is offering a good deal for the nights you need. That's how I found the Giorgione. Kayak led me to gtahotels, which had the Giorgione for only $150/night. After checking the reviews on tripadvisor, I could tell this was a quality, well-located property -- and the price was much better than I could find for comparable hotels -- so I booked it. It was a good choice. Rick Steves calls the hotel \"garish,\" and that is one of the few times I've seen Steves be completely off-base. It is a VERY nicely decorated Venitian hotel, with plenty of the glass that Venice is famous for. The courtyard and all the public rooms look very spiffy. I found the reception staff to be warm and helpful. And breakfast was much better than what you normally get in Italy, with plenty of meats, cheeses, fruit, bread, etc. -- and even bacon and eggs. I think rooms are very variable at this property, but most seem to be of at least 4-star quality. We had a charming room in the courtyard, with Venitian glass windows and antique furnishings. Very attractive. For the price paid, we really couldn't have asked for more. The location is outstanding: not hard to find, and right in the middle of things without being TOO crowded and touristy. If you can get a good deal here like we did, book it!",
            "My fiancee and I stayed here the day after I proposed to her on a cruise. We loved this place. It's in a great location and is small and quiet. They have lemonade and tea during the day if you want to grab a drink -- in the summer a quick drink like this is priceless. The rooms are a bit old fashioned if you will. Not how I would decorate them but not major complaints. The bed was a bit stiff. Other than that we loved it. The hotel staff was aware we were checking out very early (430am) to catch the first water taxi to the airport and was there with food bags waiting for us. They also helped us book a reservation at a nearby restaurant that threw in free champagne for us (I assume courtesy of the hotel). Absolutely recommend!",
            "My wife and I were a bit wary about staying at the Giorgione becuase of the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor, but the price was right (can't give an exact price because the stay was part of a complicated 3-country package) and some of the reviews made the hotel sound just OK. As it turned out, the hotel was much better than OK. Our room was good sized, especially for a European hotel, clean and comfortable. The hotel has a nice area for drinks and tea in a courtyard and offers a good (not great) breakfast, which was included in the price. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is about a 15 minute charming walk from St. Mark's and its hordes of tourists (hordes!!). We liked the location very much -- much more of a hometown Venice feel than a touristy environment. We highly recommend it.",
            "We have just arrived back from Venice and we booked at this hotel from late rooms and we asked for a superior room well very disappointed with the cupboard they gave us... the attic room with no windows just a small vulux roof window nothing like the photos on the web site!!! . A small flight of stairs went up to a small sitting room with terrace that over looked the roof tops which we never used except to put our suitcases in as the room could not fit in our luggauge. we had no hot water on 2 days in the shower. I wanted to ask to be moved but my other half being English just said leave it. The electricity box hummed very loudly and we had to take the key out at night so we could sleep.the hotel was clean and the breakfast lovely. The hotel was easy to get to from the airport very over priced for the room we had.",
            "We stayed at the Giorgione in September 2011. Our room was on the first floor opening onto the inner courtyard. Overall impression of the hotel was very good. The room was clean but very small compared to US hotels. There is a safe in the room as well as hair dryers in the bathroom, but no shower curtain, not a big problem for us since we didn't have to clean it. They had free WI-FI in the lobby and bar. The hotel location is good with a grocery store & convenience store just around the corner and many restaurants nearby. You can walk to all the attractions. The Rialto Bridge is a short walk, and there is a water bus stop close by. We bought a 3 day water bus pass at the train station which I'd highly recommend since you'll be riding the water bus a lot. The hotel staff were very helpful with directions and recommendations, a must in the old city of Venice. The American breakfast was very good, however the bacon was very undercooked, almost raw. The breakfast room and the courtyard were great. One thing we found in all the Italian hotels on this trip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the mattresses are uncomfortable. That being said, I would recommend this hotel.",
            "My daughter and I stayed at this hotel Oct. 12 and 13. This hotel is elegant and unique and we loved it. The location is great and it was in a quiet area. I would not stay in the San Marco area as it is always noisy and full of people and we spoke to some other American tourists who had issues sleeping at night due to noise in that district. We had a room on the courtyard and it had a king bed - the largest room and bath we had in Italy. The staff was wonderful and the breakfast was fabulous. I travel frequenly and would recommend this hotel because it was just a wonderful place to stay. It took us 5 minutes to walk to the Rialto Bridge and maybe 10 minutes to San Marco and some of the best cafes and restaurants are a few steps from the hotel. I hope tp return to Venice and would stay again at this charming hotel.",
            "After doing a little research, my friend gave me a list of hotels that she thought would be nice for our trip to Venice, one of which was the Hotel Giorgione. The reviews on Expedia were excellent, so I thought it was a good pick. I was wrong! Not only is the hotel quite far from the Piazza San Marco (I was aware of this as I had stayed in the Canareggio the last time I was in Venice) it was not terribly easy to find with the bad directions the Venetians gave us. Five minutes away! Close! No, it was more like at least 20 more minutes away and not close! The front desk staff was fairly helpful. One woman was extremely kind and helpful, the other was disinterested. The internet (one computer in the lobby) was very fast and free, which was a plus, but be prepared to wait a while if someone else is using it. The breakfast I found to be very yummy (fluffy eggs and bacon cooked just right - not burnt!) but lacking in fresh orange juice - sorry, only canned pineapple juice here! I would not go back again due to the location (it was a major ordeal to lug all of our stuff all around the city) but have to say the reviews were partially right, the staff can be nice, the breakfast was good enough, and the place is quaint. But be prepared for TINY rooms (the bathroom was bigger than the sleeping area) and a hotel that is more like a B&B, not even a 3 1/2 or 4 star. The pictures make the courtyard look larger and nicer than it is. It was sort of cute, but it was definitely in need of some renovation to make it look like it did in the pictures. One thing that saved the whole place was the bathroom had recently been redone and was very clean.",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Giorgione two years ago, and like its location in the Cannaregio. The staff was still helpful, the breakfast area still lovely, the location still good, though for people who aren't big walkers, the 20-minute walk to San Marco might be an issue. I love the Cannaregio and the lovely little pasticerria down the street. Our room this time, however, was much smaller than previously. It did have a nice view over the courtyard, though. I find the hotel easy to locate, and I have a very bad sense of direction. Also, for any runners, the hotel is a good location for that, as it's easy to run down the Strada Nuova (just down the street from the hotel) and parallel streets without getting lost. We will probably still here again on our next visit to Venice.",
            "stayed here for 3 days excellent location short walk to most tourist attractions very easy to navigate to important sights hotel was clean buffet breakfast very good staff was lovely with the exception of evening female desk clerk (do not know her name) hotel room was clean but incredibly warm hotel unable to resolve this",
            "Fantastic hotel, easy walk to everywhere in particular the grand canal, vaporetto, Rialto, but nice and quiet at the hotel itself. If the weather is dry you eat your breakfast in a beautiful courtyard. All the staff from manager to barman to cleaner were friendly, helpful and could not have done more for us. Room, lounge, dining area very well maintained and spotlessly clean. Good choice of food at breakfast. I understand the manager and his family actually own the hotel and think that showed through. Recommend without hesitation.",
            "The room was as promised; a two-story junior suite with a terrace affording views over Canneregio. Breakfasts and the coffee were wonderful. I liked it; I am an optimist. However, my travel companion found the airconditioning inadequate, as well as the neighborhood too far removed from \"the true Venice\". Que sera sera",
            "This was our first visit to venice and we were not disappointed. The hotel was as described in a quiet area but we found venice quite a quiet place after 11.00pm anyway. The staff were very friendly and the hotel was beautiful inside. It was lovely to sit by the decorative pool, enjoying a drink whilst listening to relaxing operatic music which played gently in the background. Finding our way around was a little tricky at first but people are very willing to point you in the right direction. I would definitely return to this hotel.",
            "The Hotel Giorgione was a mixed bag. On the one hand, the location was great, enabling easy walks to the Rialto Bridge and San Marco Square. A cozy wine bar is literally right next door as well, and down a small street is a lovely square where vendors set up shop and some of the few trees in Venice proper can be found. It only took us one full day to familiarize ourselves with the city and our immediate surroundings, and we soon felt right at home in the quaint, romantic town. The lobby areas in the hotel are well-kept (but beware the pics they display on their website - all our photoshopped and the colors are no where near as vibrant) and the daily breakfast was varied and delicious. The staff are extremely helpful and accommodating as well. I know the last point first hand as our initial room was an oversized closet. We literally had to climb over our suitcases to reach the bathroom. There were also stains on the walls and a few on the sheets. The next day I stopped by the front desk to voice my concerns and was pleased with a phone call later in the day from the manager offering us an upgrade. We immediately accepted and what a difference it made. The second room was over twice the size, spotless and altogether charming. Moral of the story: if you choose the Giorgione, be sure to book a suite. We were also treated to a complimentary bottle of champagne upon our arrival (it was our honeymoon) and thoroughly enjoyed the terrace just a flight down from our room and the lovely courtyard. All in all I would recommend the Hotel Giorgione to those looking for a Venetian hotel that's a few notches above average (but not exceptional) in a great location that won't knock your socks off but won't let you down either. (More on michael petitti dot com)",
            "Absolutely excellent staff, great rooms and excellent breakfast included daily. Lots of local information provided by the staff with English explanations that were comprehensive. You will feel part of their hotel and they will become part of your trip. Facilities were equal to our first Italian hotel, a Four Star. You will not regret staying at this hotel. Venice itself is expensive but this hotel gives mid week discounts on Expedia of $25 a day. It was a real pleasure to stay here and say hello to \"Enrica\" at the front Reception, she is the greatest.",
            "We stayed in Hotel Girogione for 3 nights as part of a two week Honeymoon in Italy and couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay. We had a water taxi in from Marco Polo aiport which took 20 mins got off it and walked for 2 mins to the hotel. The hotel is decorated really well and the staff are so friendly and can speak many languages. It is 5 mins from Rialto bridge and 20 mins from St Marks squares so is ideal for exploring. It is lovely and quiet at night and the rooms are well air-conditioned. Breakfast as with all the hotel we stayed at in Italy is a continental style buffet and has plenty of variation and everything is fresh. I would have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone and it is very well priced too. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.",
            "Getting to this hotel is a bit of a puzzle, but get off at the Ca d'Oro, turn right at the end of the alley, follow the street until you reach the second big street, make a hard left and the hotel is right in front of you. The rooms are small by American standards, but well appointed, and the bath is excellent. Great breakfast room with a courtyard, and there is a lounge and a bar. Breakfast is good and there are even scrambled eggs and English bacon. The wait staff will gladly brew you a capucchino if you ask. The restaurant next door is popular with the locals and the waiters are a joy. The neighborhood is wonderful for wandering with lots of dark alleys and small canals. I won't waste your time with suggestions for Venice, get lost, enjoy, explore. Venice is a banquet of the unexpected. One honest word, however, there is at times the smell of raw sewage about the place. The staff is always running about spritzing the place and the rooms come with plug-in air freshners. But...in the morning, you are awakened by the bells of the nearby convent school, and the songs of children as they walk to class. Thoroughly charming.",
            "although we were in venice in feb '03, the hotel giorgione made our romantic stay most memorable. the ambiance was relaxing, and the staff was so friendly. we peruse the website periodicially, hoping to return soon within the next few years. the breakfast was delicious, and having a usa today newspaper was a bonus. the hotel is magnificent, and the room was decorated beautifully. we stayed 4 nights, and we had easy access to many of the sites within walking distance. the hotel is quiet, and the vaporrato boats are close by. the staff answered all of our questions. one criticism, if the hotel allows smoking, i would change all of it to non-smoking. we look forward to returning soon...thx again, teresa, from portland, oregon, u.s.a.",
            "Chose this hotel after reviewing guide books and this web site and was not disappointed. Hotel was excellent in every respect. The service and staff were superb. Location is ideal in what is a small city. Breakfast buffet was more than adequate and the public areas were very comfortable and beautifully decorated. We would certainly return to this hotel if we go back to Venice. We found the city of Venice to be a unique destination, very different from any other. The traffic free streets and canals providing routes around the city take you back in time. The absence of traffic lets you hear the birds and the church bells right in the city centre. Once you get away from St Mark's square, the streets, museums and churches were very quiet at the beginning of April.",
            "Picked the hotel using expedia results and would agree. Good value, friendly staff with afternoon tea and coffee available every day. About 20 minutes walk from san marco, but what a great walk it is. River buses are convenient. Rooms are smallish, but well furnished and decorated and very clean. The only thing I would have liked is tea/coffee facilities in the rooms. Would definitely stay again.",
            "I've always wanted to go Venice and my lovely fianc\u00c3\u00a9 have arranged a trip to Venice on my birthday in January. He booked the hotel because my daughter has a similar name and the reviews were very good. The position of hotel is great as we stayed away from the hustle of central Venice and took a pleasure in a lovely stroll from St Marks square every night. The room was fabulous, beautiful venetian blue decor with a little sitting room and a sun terrace which we enjoyed even in winter. The breakfast was great and dinner was arranged with sister restaurant next door which was mouth watering even for my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 who is very fussy where meals are concerned. Lastly, the staff was very friendly and always smiling and very polite. We have absolutely loved the three days in Venice and we loved the hotel so much that we are considering going back and get married there. Absolutely fantastic.",
            "This hotel has character. Its charming and full of antiques and glass chandeliers. The staff was very friendly and they were the only hotel to acknowledge our honeymoon by giving us a complimentary bottle of champagne and a Murano glass heart. Our room was small but very cute. The breakfast was substantial and a nice addition. They had toast, pastries, fruit, cheese, etc. The location was good for us because it was right near the boat to go to the airport and was about a 15-20 minute walk from the train station, but we made it with our luggage. The only complaint we really had was that the shower had no door or curtain and the shower head sprayed alot so water went everywhere! Im sure it was more inconvenient for the staff than for us :) I definitely recommend this hotel.",
            "Out of all the hotels that we stayed in within Italy, this was by far our favorite. It has an old fashioned feeling with a grand staircase. No floor is the same. They have a large lounge area and even a pool table (which we used since it rained the entire time we were there). The breakfast was wonderful, and the HUGE venetian chandelier in the courtyard is amazing. Eat breakfast outside under the chandelier and watch the birds hop around. The rooms have venetian chandeliers and comfy beds. Small room compared to US standards, but still cozy. There are chairs for reading and watching tv. The only wierd thing is when you take a shower, half of the bathroom floor gets wet......don't let this discourage you from staying though. It is rather comical. Wonderful location, central to everything. We can't wait to return.",
            "We stayed at Hotel Giorgione from 8/29 to 9/1. I was a little worried about finding the hotel in the narrow windy streets of Venice, but it was very easy to find. You can see the hotel from the piazza at Campo di S.S. Apostoli if you look to your left after you reach the piazza from the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Oro stop. One of the pictures I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve attached is this view. We reserved a standard double room for 100 euro a night on their website, but they must have upgraded us because we ended up with a junior loft room. The room was huge, very nice, and was always clean. The carpeting was a little old and could be replaced. The bathroom was very large with a bathtub and double sinks. It is the largest bathroom I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in all the three and four star hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in Europe. The one downside to the bathroom is that it could take up to 10 minutes to get any warm water in the shower. The cost of breakfast was included in the cost of the room so we had it everyday. The breakfast was one of the worst we had during our two weeks in Italy. The assortment of food was good, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd food was lukewarm or cold, and the coffee (American drip-brewed) was also lukewarm or cold. The morning we checked out we had breakfast the minute they opened and the coffee and food were finally hot. The other mornings we would typically get down there 30-60 minutes after they opened. The hotel staff was very nice and friendly, and while we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect everyone to speak English, their English was very good. We would stay here again on a return trip to Venice.",
            "Spent 3 nights in September. Highlights: beautiful lobby; very helpful and friendly staff; great breakfast (with a few hot dishes); beautiful outdoor courtyard for meals and drinks; reasonable rates; free WiFi. Pool table and bar in lobby. Downside: rooms are small; hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk from nearest vaporetta station, and directions given by the hotel were so vague as to useless in the challenging streets of Venice. This was a problem when we arrived late and with luggage. Location is quiet, as it is 1-2 blocks off the nearest square. About a 10-15 minute walk to St. Mark's square.",
            "We stayed only one night, so perhaps not enough time to really judge. My impressions are these. It was rather like an old dowager of a hotel whose best days are behind it. The staff was variable. Some quite gracious, some not so much. The restaurant was mediocre at best, but we only ate there for breakfast. The location was good, particularly for leaving for the airport as it was an easy walk - even with luggage to the airport boat. The room was very clean as was the bathroom. Our room had a loft for a bedroom and we both had to climb a very step stairway to get up and down. Dangerous for an old-timer like me. Especially in the middle of the night. All things considered it was far too expensive for the overall quality.",
            "We stayed at the Girorgione after friends recommended it, and we weren't disappointed. Rick Steves call the hotel \"garish\", which I just don't get. It's close to the Rialto but isn't right on one of the main thoroughfares. The staff was extremely helpful, and the rooms were charming. We loved the painted furniture and especially the Murano glass chandelier. The breakfast was genorous and served in a bueatiful dining room, and if the weather had been just a tad warmer, we'd have been able to enjoy it in the lovely courtyard. One nice bonus is that they have a computer with free internet access right off the lobby, allowing us to check in on our email without having to find and pay for an internet cafe. The one drawback to our room was that it was over the hotel's restaurant, so there was some noise in the evenings. It looked like there were only a few rooms that would have this problem, so if you plan on turning in early, be sure and ask for a room that isn't over the restaurant. Speaking of the restaurant, we tried it but wouldn't recommend it. It's overpriced, the Trattoria da Beppi just around the corner had better food at better prices.",
            "Giorgione is a bit difficult to find but this could be said of a lot of things in Venice. Likewise, it is massively overpriced but, again, this is also true of all of Venice. It's a cute hotel with lovely courtyard to enjoy throughout the day. Breakfast is very nicely done and the wait staff work very, very hard to accomodate everyone's requests. In general, the staff is very courteous and helpful. The beds are pretty \"firm\" (hard), even by the standards of European hotels. The hotel is pretty easy to get around in and there are a number of restaurants nearby. The A/C is somewhat questionable, but this is true of many hotels in Italy and Europe. I'm not sure I would say the hotel is a \"good value\" but it's a great home base for get around in one of the world's most beautiful cities.",
            "This place was an absolute delight! From the moment we came dragging our luggage toward the front door (after having scrambled on and off of a water bus on a hot day) the front desk staff was ready to serve. A uniformed bellman came outside to help me with my enormous suitcase! When we stepped inside, we knew we were in for a real treat. This hotel was decorated beautifully in rich reds and golds and greens. There is a very generous sitting area near the lobby as well as an absolutely beautiful sitting/eating area out back. There are glass chandeliers everywhere and an air of elegance wherever you look. My room was small, but lovely, and the bathroom was large, by European standards. They served iced tea and cookies every afternoon near the outdoor fountain, and the breakfast in the morning was fabulous! There were hot and cold selections, and the variety was really generous. Again, uniformed employees kept things replenished. We enjoyed our meal outdoors, but we also had the option of eating in the dining area indoors. There is a full-service bar near the lobby, too, so it was easy to have a nice glass of wine before heading out to dinner. The front desk was very helpful with maps and suggestions, too. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It was definitely the nicest accommodation of our entire two-week trip!",
            "good middle class hotel in venice. central, good area to explore. close to Canale Grande and to restaurants. 20 minutes walk to Piazza San Marco: the right distance for staying out of the heavy tourist hassle; north of it there is a quiet and interesting area. but not very authentic inside the hotel. clean, small rooms, thin walls. staff rather cool in the beginning, but friendly and helpful if you make a little effort too. internet in the lobby. breakfast ok, but not really italian style either. international clients from everywhere. not far from vaporetto station, which is good get there the first time and to get around while stying in Venice. I can recommend it - if your neighbours let you sleep.",
            "We stayed at this hotel in August 2004. It was superb!!! The staff were extremely friendly, rooms very clean and the breakfast really good with plenty to eat. There were 6 adults in our party and we all thought the same. We would recommend this hotel to everyone. It really lived up to its 4 star rating! It helped made our first visit to Venice truly magical.",
            "the location of the hotel is fantastic. Only two stops with a Vaporetto from the airport, 5 minutes from the Rialto bridge, but a street away from the route where the masses of tourists walk. Right around the corner is a very cute wine bar, above all local go there. Breakfast can be taken in the inner courtyard, very romantic with vines, candles, a small fountain, sparrow flying in the courtyard as pidgeon on St Marc Square. If you prefer to sit inside, tables are set in white linnen and chair covers. Breakfast is served as buffet, including eggs and something like saussage or bacon. For Italy, the variety is great as usually they only drink cappuchino and eat a few cakes / cookies. The bar is open until 12 at night. The barman is fantastic and very nice and flexible. Reception is very nice, a bit stiff. :) The room are very clean, furnitured with antique furniture. For Venice, rather big as space is something that you will not find in Venice. I can only recommend the hotel. The only thing I noticed that in the mornings you hear kids playing, there must be a school or a kindergarden right behind it. Previous reviews mentioned it too.",
            "Old traditional hotel, ten minutes walk from the hospital and half an hour from the train station. Very friendly staff at the reception. Room was clean, though full of carpet. The building is old and so was the bathroom, there was no shower curtain. Beauty products we minimal but sufficient. Sleeping quality good, although the bed was a bit short. Temperature regulation in the room fine and adjustable. The minibar in the room was well filled with good prices. Breakfast was nice with fresh products and choice between american coffee or freshly sved cappuccino or italian coffee. Considering the price i would reccomend this hotel as it has a decent. It doesn't have a lot of luxury.",
            "Nice breakfast, friendly staff and good location spoiled by my final bill where we discovered several drinks that we had not consumed from the frigobar being charged. Pointed to the staff who offered refund after we had already paid as the drinks where charged as a total and not described as it should be. We got a quite good room just above of the reception facing the street which was a bit noise sometimes. The room had nice decoration spoiled by watermarks under the windows and the flush from one of the toilets that when pressed would splash water from the toilet on the floor. However the room had two toilets and showers... the TV had a maximum sound volume which was a bit too little for my ears....Now funnily enough the bill situation happened after we have been in a situation where i saw one Italian guy buying one paint and paying 20 euros and when i asked the \"artist\" how much he was charging for the pictures he told me that the prices where by size and the same size that the Italian guy paid 20 he asked me for 30 euros... heard some more from other people while there in Venice about being charged different amount for the same things... so watch out for the ripping-offs.... good luck and have a nice time...",
            "The Hotel was booked for us by Railbookers and was easy to reach from the station. It is a very attractive building in a quiet but interesting part of this magnificent city. Our welcome was warm and friendly and having requested a quiet room we were given one opening straight on to the large inner courtyard/garden. The bedroom was decorated in a traditional style to suit the building, with pretty glass light fittings, and the bathroom was large with a wet shower area (no bath). We were aware of occasional brief noises during the night, possibly from the plumbing, but nothing that really disturbed our sleep. We ate breakfast in the courtyard, which has a fountain (turned on at 8.45am) and beautiful jasmine plants. A pretty good choice of food although limited fresh fruit.",
            "My sister, who is a frequent visitor to Venice, recommended this hotel to us as a romantic, convenient place to stay. We agree with her wholeheartedly. The hotel is beautifully decorated, oozing with charm, clean, with a wonderful breakfast buffet and a lovely dining room. Our bed was in a loft which gave our room an airy, spacious feel. The neighborhood is quiet but close to the Rialto area and a glorious walk to most tourist attractions in Venice. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. You need to go to the lobby to use the internet though.",
            "We stayed in this reasonably priced hotel in November 2004 and Nov. 2005. Both times the staff was great, the breakfasts were delicious and were served in a lovely setting. The second time we had a junior suite, which worked well. Will stay here the next time I'm in Venice."

            "We enjoyed our stay at The River Hotel. It is a great location easily accessible to public transit. Our room was small, but it had a European type of feel, and it seemed many guests were European. We had both a small fridge and a microwave which was helpful. The free wireless is a nice feature with ability to print downstairs. I did not use the fitness center since we do so much walking, but would have had they had a pool. My bad for not checking that. The water bottle filling stations on each floor is also another great feature. We did not eat at the restaurant, but there are many nearby, including Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks for coffee and breakfast. Filming of Transformers 3 was taking place during our visit which made it very interesting.",
            "My husband, adult son and I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. The kitchenette (stove top, microwave, refrigerator) allowed us to fix breakfasts quickly \"at home\" before going out for early tours and to save money on some easy suppers. Basic pots, pans, plates, and cooking and eating utensils were provided. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. We didn't hear any noise from the street or from other guests with the white noise of the air conditioner....delightful sleeping. The two bathrooms were a luxury for the three of us. Note that the 2 bedrooms (one king, one queen) do not have doors, so they are semi-private, not totally private. Unfortunately, the sitting area was a little claustrophobic because we had expected a window and view. Instead there was just one window in the 2nd bedroom with no windows in the living area. At the front desk, I was told that all of the 2 bedroom suites have the same \"view\". We could see just other close buildings (no river) from the window in the bedroom. As other reviewers have remarked, the hotel's location is the BEST! We took the orange line from Midway and our son took the blue line from O'Hare to within several blocks of the hotel. We walked or took public transportation everywhere while touring.",
            "nice enough...check-in dude acted like he was doing me a big favor giving me a king-size bed, as they were out of queens. Woo-hoo! If I had made my own reservation, instead of our company picking this place for us, I would have got this as a matter of course... No tub, just shower; old tube tv. Was cold close to window. One light by bed didn't work, stopper in sink wouldn't stay stopped, and shower head had a leak in back, squirting water in reverse....what left bad impression (and was the last interaction I had with staff) was when I was checking out, I wanted to tell person behind desk about these things that needed fixing, and *she did not even interrupt her conversation with her colleague or even LOOK at me while she handed me my receipt*. I -did- interrupt her to tell her.....but no \"how was your stay/ how was the room/thank you and we'll see you next time\". It's a shame that the art of recognizing a customer (hint: LOOK AT him/her!) does not seem to be part of the training here. The fact that I feel strongly enough to post this review should be an indicator that customers value people skills! and deplore their absence in a person employed in a service industry!",
            "I travelled to Chicago to meet my parents who were visiting from overseas. A triple room had been booked in the Club Quarters hotel. I was the first to arrive and the room was a small room with a double bed and a sofa bed. I had been told at reception that we could upgrade to a larger suite for an additional $20 a night. We decided to upgrade and we were given a room in the River Hotel portion of the hotel. The room was phenomenal. It cost $140 a night and it was like a small, open-plan apartment. It had a fully equiped kitchenette and dining area and on either end of the suite, there were bedrooms, one with a king size bed and one with a queen. There were two bathrooms and there was also a sitting area with a television although this was not really necessary as both bedrooms had televisions also. We were so completely impressed with the hotel, I would whole-heartedly recommend it. It's very well located on the Magnificent mile right across from stop 2 on the trolley tour and the boarding area for the river cruises. The room was so comfortable and lovely and while I'm not sure if the cost of the upgrade to a suite was a special offer or not, it was definitely well worth the additional $20.",
            "This hotel is located on Wacker at Michigan. Lots of restaurants, shopping, sightseeing and Millenium Park close by. The hotel seemed more like a business club -- small lobby, small spartan rooms, built for short stays. But with the rates as low as they are, it's a busy hotel. The entire hotel staff was very nice and helpful. Housekeeping needs improvement. The bathroom floor had not been swept when I checked in and the bedspread had a small stain on it. On the second day, when I returned at 4:00, the room had still not been cleaned so it appeared that cleaning is completed quickly but not meticulously. If you can look past minor issues and alert the hotel staff when there are problems, then it will be worth it to book here. It's not perfect but you can't beat the price and location.",
            "While the first room they offered us was tiny (corner room), since that was all that was available, we waited and got a larger room (queen size bed, though they admitted it was shorter than the average queen bed). After the high prices at a nearby Hyatt, we appreciated the refrigerator for our use (vs. the Hyatt Regency where a Pepsi cost $4.25 and a sign warned us that using the fridge for our own items could result in a $25 fine), and microwave and plates and utensils if we wanted to eat in. Lounge had computers with free Internet use and printers (quite a change from the high prices of the Hyatt's business center). This is no swanky hotel, and the elevators were often overcrowded, resulting in waits, and I've slept in more comfortable beds, but for the price, it was fine. This is a hotel chain for members, though we had booked through Travelocity as non-members. When we tried to get information on staying in a Club Quarters in Washington, DC, the front desk said we had to call a central reservation number (not toll free); had to leave a message with someone who never returned our call.",
            "Got this room for $60 a night. It's right on Wacker and Michigan - so convenient for all the shopping and an excellent location. As stated the rooms aren't large, but I was by myself so I didn't mind, although even if I had my partner with me I still think it would be fine. The most important thing for me as a single traveller though was that it was clean, bright and very safe feeling. The bathroom was very clean and modern (I can't stand fusty old bathrooms), the bed was comfy, you get a desk with wireless access and TV, Microwave and Fridge. So very happy with the room. The service was also very good and efficient. They even let me leave my baggage with them a week later when I was back in Chicago even though I didn't stay with them that night. The Italian cafe attached is excellent! I had great pasta and salad there and the service was fantastic. All in all a great stay for the price. The corner cafe also does great breads.",
            "We loved this hotel! The location was excellent. Easy walking to Navy Pier, Magnificient Mile, and tons of restaurants! Hotel was clean and the staff was so friendly. They have computers on the second floor with free high speed internet also. The only downfall is that it is a highrise and there are only two elevators. They are very slow. Sometimes I would have to wait 5 minutes or so for an elevator. That is really irritating if you forgot something and wanted to run back to the room! Plus we were on the 15th floor so we couldn't take the stairs! Other than that, the hotel was wonderful!",
            "This is a superior hotel offering a great location for a reasonable price. Those who are travelling with others might find the rooms small, but the riverside view from my room on the 38th floor (arranged at check-in) more than made up for this. Anyone visiting Chicago for the sights would appreciate the view of downtown, stretching to Sears Tower, the Field Museum, Lake Michigan and beyond. Great food is available from the small bistro on the ground floor, and all requests to front desk staff were very cheerfully accommodated. Maid service was of the highest standard. I would stay here again without a moment's hesitation and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",
            "My wife and I just visited Chicago to celebrate our 12th anniversary and chose to stay at the River Hotel. This was our first overnight trip in Chicago and I have to say that I was more than satisfied with my experience at the River Hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful during our stay. We stayed in a Junior Suite and it was immaculately clean, incredibly quiet and we had a great view of the river. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had a great night of rest. I also appreciated the solid high speed internet connection that I had in our room. The hotel is within walking distance of the Theatre District and all of the shopping the State St and Michigan avenue have to offer. We will definitely be staying at the River Hotel on our next trip to Chicago.",
            "Superb location, great building (sneak all the way to the top of the atmospheric stairways for some great views), friendly and helpful staff, supremely comfortable bed, hot and poweful shower, nice touches like free broadband and bottled water... And cheap. What's not to like? If you want to spend all day in a bigger room go and stay at a bog-standard chain hotel and pay twice the price. But why would you, you're in Chicago!",
            "This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect; right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it.",
            "I found the hotel to be very clean. The room was small, but well equipped. Internet was available in a business center in the lobby. I was vacationing so this was not a problem for me. The mattress was firm, but that is my preference. I felt it was a great central location and within walking distance of the Chicago Art Museum and the Mag. Mile. On site restaurant was good as well.",
            "Needed to stay downtown for business meetings, and found Club Quarters (usually a member-only hotel) available online at a great price. While the room was a little smaller than others I've had downtown, the location was great, the room was clean, quiet and in pristine shape, and the bar downstairs was very friendly and convenient. Great place to stay.",
            "The bed linens had stains. The staff was very rude (with the exception of one lady). The towels had tears in them, very old and roughly used a few of them. It was more of a self service hotel. Definatley not a classy joint.",
            "My wife and I stayed here one night to go to a show at the Chicago Theater. We actually live on the outskirts of Chicago (by O'hare) but since it was an 11pm show we didn't want to have to take the train back. The rooms are small, but how much time should you be spending in there anyways? They are clean, nice (albeit somewhat small) bathrooms and a great location for perfect access to State street and Michigan Ave. Don't waste your money going to a more expensive hotel, especially if you are going to be out doing things. One random note: the water bottle stations are really nice and convenient. You can take the bottles with you when you go out walking around or whatever too.",
            "I booked a room at the River Hotel after seeing the reviews on here. The price was right and I had looked at the Club Quarters (which is the sister hotel located in the same building) and wanted to stay at Rivers. We ended up staying in Club Quarters anyway. I was really disappointed. I talked to management about it and was told that they were booked up and our only choice was to drive to another hotel a mile away. Sort of defeats the purpose of staying on the River. So we stayed at Club Quarters and the experience we had was very similar to the other reviewers. The room was small but clean and comfortable, until the patron next door started signing every morning with his radio around 7 am. The walls were so thin we could hear people in the hallway the elevators, and our neighbor doing all sorts of things. Location was great, price was right, but I wouldn't stay again. When I book a room at a hotel I expect to stay there, not somewhere else.",
            "This hotel is in a great location-right near Michigan Avenue and all that offers. I stayed in a club size room on a recent business trip and it was perfect for what I needed. The room was on the smaller side, but I didn't need a lot of space. The small window offered a great view of the Chicago River. The internet worked well enough-my only complaint was that the TV couldn't swivel to face the bed (though I don't think that's a problem with all room setups.) The staff was very friendly and helpful in answering my questions, and the parking was close enough. All in all, a great room if you don't need a ton of luxury or space.",
            "Booked the hotel online because of the availability of a '2 bedroom suite'. It turns out that the 2 bedroom suite had NO privacy or doors for the 'bedrooms.' When I called to complain, the hotel staff told me their add nver guaranteed a door for the bedrooms. Despite trying to cancel within 2 hours of booking the reservation in an off season during the middle of the week, Hotel management refused to give me a refund and charged me for a full night stay. Make sure you get your reservation right, because once they get your money they won't let go!",
            "In terms of location, Club Quarters on Wacker can hardly be beat. It's right near Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile and most of the rooms have great views of the Chicago River and its landmark buildings -- the upper floors give a view of the Lake. The rooms are on the small size, but very clean and quiet. My room had only a shower stall and no tub (but I only take a shower anyhow). The price was very good indeed, and I checked in and out without a glitch. Bella Bacino's, the restaurant on the ground floor, offered excellent Chicago-style pizza and interesting beers on tap. Yum!! A couple negatives: the Wi-Fi was weak and intermittent. No sort of breakfast is offered, which I don't really see as a problem -- but I wanted to get a cup of coffee on my way out to my conference in the morning and they were out at the moment. Grrr -- must have coffee! But overall it was a good experience and I would recommend it. You're not paying anything near a luxury price, so don't expect luxury -- just a decent room in a great location.",
            "Stayed at Club Quarters Wacker at Michigan from Nov. 28-30 2007. EXCELLENT LOCATION, right off the Mag. Mile. Hotel staff was very friendly, and the housekeeper staff was equally as professional. This is mostly a business hotel, which is great, because no noisy children, and rowdy college kids, very quiet hotel. Although the rooms are small, is very cozy, and all amentias worked fine. There is a doorman out front which keeps out some of the street people from filtering in, as most of the big cities hotel have. Secure and safe location, \"El\" station right around the corner (State & Lake Stop). I would stay here again. I can really think of nothing negative to say. Bottom line... great 3 star hotel, safe area, good location.",
            "I booked this hotel through hotwire and was very happily surprised. We wanted a room close to the Magnificent Mile and we could not have found a better location. The entrance is tiny and the hotel does not appear to be great upon entering (turn right after the street entrance to find the clerks). The room itself is quite small, but very nice and clean. The bath room was also small but very functional. The average day time temp was 90F and the hotel AC kept up very well. The bed was very comfortable and had nice linens. We also had a room on the 22nd floor and we treated to an amazing view of the drawbridges on the river. They have recyclable water bottles and water filling stations throughout the building. Very handy for the hot weather we experienced!! The hotel is close to great restaurants (the Pizza at the onsite hotel was excellent as was the service!). We booked well ahead of time to get our deal ($150/night).",
            "Have stayed in many hotels in chicago and this is the smallest room I have ever stayed in. The housekeeping was a bit hit and miss some days coffee some days none!The plus points were free internet in the lounge and a water cooler which you could fill with the available bottles on each floor which saves a few bucks each day. The reception staff were a bit snooty for us holiday makers , witnessed very different treatment of business travellers.",
            "This is a really great find, in a superb location. The rooms although small are beautifully designed, comfortably and stylishly equipped with just about everything you could want, (except perhaps a fridge). The bathrooms, equally compact, do offer plenty of shelf space, make up mirrors, hairdryers and Gilchrist and Soames toiletries. A thoughtful touch in the rooms is a selection of reading matter (fiction, non fiction, personal development and reference in my room) and I very much appreciate the provision of water, high speed internet and incidentals like washing powder in the guest laundry. There are closets on each floor stocked with extra pillows, blankets, irons, ironing boards, milk, sugar etc so that guests can help themselves to what they need, whenever they want it. I stayed here on business (and it is particularly suited to the needs of the business traveller), but would happily return to this hotel for a holiday.",
            "The hotel is perfect for the weekend getaway for couples. While the rooms are small, we found it very clean and had a great view of the Chicago River (ask for this when booking). Hotel staff was great with dining, touring, and entertainment suggestions, as well as directions, transportation suggestions, etc. The location could not be better in relation to attractions, theatre, shopping, and tours. Perfect hotel for our needs. We can;t wait to go back to this great city and hotel. Great weekend rates.",
            "Didnit' care for the size of the room based on room rate of $124.00. Confusing lobby used for both River Hotel and Club Quarters. Did not like using room keycard to use the elevator. Not necessaary since my friend stayed a couple blocks away at the Hyatt Rengency and the elevator ran as expected without using room keycard. Also, she had a bigger room for under $190.00 for the same night.",
            "I booked this hotel in August '07 for a weekend baseball series between the Red Sox and White Sox. I was very satisfied with the amenities of the club sized room (bed and bathroom) but it was small. The only problem I had is that the walls were thin and unfortunately early Saturday morning I had to hear a couple having sexual intercourse for 30 minutes which interrupted my sleep. Other than that, this hotel is highly recommended.",
            "Great location and extremely friendly and helpful staff. I was made to feel very welcome from the moment I arrived and the duty manager (Tim??) couldn't do enough for me. I was given a room with a view without negotiation! The location could not be better - just off Michigan Ave and next door to a great breakfast bakery. Enjoy!",
            "This hotel is conveniently located along Wacker and is close to a few subway stops. Depending on the room you get (we got 1804), you can get gorgeous views of Lake Michigan. When we arrived at 12pm, staff were friendly and we got our room straight away. There are two elevators that cater the higher levels, so be prepared to wait a while if there is a lot of traffic. The room itself was standard; clean, not particularly spacious, shower only, working TV, toiletries, coffee and free internet. The queen bed was comfortable. For $100, it wasn't a bad deal.",
            "They charge your credit card at the time of booking NOT at time of arrival. DO NOT DO THIS! This is a scam-ish deal. They will not refund if something goes wrong...... ALSO they turned off heating system. NO HEATER!!!! Temps out were 50ish... NO fun cold room and very hard bed.",
            "I suppose my only real grip about the hotel (which was not the hotel's fault) is that we paid way too much for it. We stayed during Chicago Marathon weekend and we booked through Hotwire. We stayed in the tower which did have a nice view but was probably a bit smaller than rooms in the main building. There was room to swing a cat but it would have had been a pretty small cat. For example, our room had an iron and ironing board but I'm not entirely sure that there was room to set up the ironing board. On the other hand, there were several panels of windows with good views, including part of Millenium Park. The room was generally quiet but I think we faced the Hard Rock Hotel so on Saturday night we heard music until the wee hours. The location was good though, just across the bridge from the Magnificant Mile, close to subway and bus lines. It was great having free internet and printing access. We had little interaction with the staff but they seemed friendly and nice. I wouldn't really recommend the Italian restaurant in the lobby, hoever, unless you just wanted a quick bite. There are better places for alot less. If I had stayed there for business, I think I would have rated the hotel higher. It really is pretty ideal for the business road warrior with queen bed, lots of outlets, and desk. For a weekend get away kind of place, I wouldn't recommend it. It just lacked any ambiance, had a small room, and a smaller shower only bathroom. It was ok just not great.",
            "We stayed at Club Quarters Wacker Dr. Chicago on New Yeqar's Eve. There were four of us. We booked a room with two double beds. I haven't seen beds so small since the Dick VanDyke Show. These were Rob and Laura beds! There was barely room for one person on each bed, much less two. Of course they had no other rooms available. So we requested two roll aways. They kept insisting that we didn't have room for two. The room was extremeley small, but we knew we could make it work. After putting the night stand in the closet, pushing the two single beds together, and shoving the furniture against the wall, we had room. They argued with us nonstop, and finally told us that they would try two. Well, needless to say, upon returning at 3:00 AM, there was only one roll away. The front desk staff was very rude. Sure, they were crabby, but we were the ones who didn't have enough room to sleep. We ended up having to just deal with it. They were also very rude when we ordered a pizza. You have to go down and pick it up as they do not allow delivery people in the hotel. The desk staff was short with us when we didn't understand the procedure at first. Yes, we had had a few cocktails along the way, but we weren't beligerant or sloppy drunk. We were actually quite nice considering the way we were being treated. I understand that the last place they probably wanted to be was there working as all the partiers came in from their festivities, however, it is their job, and they chose it. Had the staff not been so rude, the lack of sleeping space would not have been quite as tough to take. We will never book with CLub Quarters again!",
            "I would highly recommend you this hotel. It's in really nice location to down town Chicago and rooms are really tidy and modern. I liked big bath room. Free wireless internet and laundry were really nice. They have nice cold drinking water in the hallway. Gim opens 5AM-10 PM. I will definetly come back here! !",
            "Room was clean and well maintained. Small but not cramped. The desk was well appointed with an LCD monitor on an arm, several outlets, interconnect cables, reading lamp and a shelf. Very comfortable working chair. Bathroom was for 1 but had plenty of space. Shower not a tub. Toilet was European style flush of 2 different water volumes. Good use of space for cabinet drawers and closet in the room. Free bottled water on every floor--fill it yourself near the elevator. Great feature. I found a closet in the hallway near the elevator where guests self-serve ironing board, iron, extra blankets, etc. Nice touch. To check into the room, just insert your credit card into the kiosk in the small lobby. Confirm a few details and out pops your room keys/cards. Must use the cards in the elevator to get to your floor. Restaurant next to the lobby is room service. Overall, it's a self-service hotel with little staff. But it's efficient, clean, well designed, in a great location and a great value at $139/night.",
            "This is not a luxury hotel. but offers a good value for money. Excellent location in the heart of Chicago, in the historical Mather Tower. The room was large enough, clean, with a view on east Wacker drive and Chicago river. Free Wi-Fi internet.The restaurant (Bella Bacino's) is great for a Chicago style stuffed pizza.",
            "We had a few family members in Chicago for the weekend, so we booked a room at the River Hotel because of the location. It's close to Wacker Drive and the room was contemporary albeit on the small side. Went out to meet a few people for dinner and we came back finding out that the AC was not working. We alerted the staff at the lobby and realized that the maintenance guy had left for the day. How can the hotel not have a maintenance person 24 hours a day? Needless to say, we were shocked to hear about it. We did not pay more than $150 and get a room that is as warm as an oven. When the staff learnt about our story, they unempathetically asked us to open the windows instead!!! Mind you, that does not make any sense considering the weather outside was about 90 F. They then offered to move us to another location away from the river but we refused because we chose the location for a reason and it is an unnecessary inconvenience to us at our expense. It was not our fault to begin with. After that they offered us a crappy fan which finally worked when we gave it a few knocks. It was a warm and miserable night for our family who came all the way to Chicago expecting something wonderful from this hotel. The next morning, we mentioned about it at the front desk again and all they could do was apologized. Not a single time did they compensate us in a form of a lower rate for putting us through this. After all, we did not sign up for a room which has AC problems. After much complains, the staff finally offer us a free upgrade if we come back the next time. That is not acceptable. What is the use of a free upgrade if the AC is not going to work?? Well, we won't be coming back anyways. He can keep his offer. You shouldn't come here either.",
            "I'm amazed at the bad reviews -- my wife and I had absolutely no complaints. It's a small hotel/condo combination in a beautifully-restored historic building, right on the river on East Wacker. So you can be perfectly situated downtown for half the price of the Swisshotel and the Hyatt Monster a couple of blocks westward. You can check yourself in on automated kiosks, although staffers will do it for you without your asking. We didn't encounter a single rude employee -- if anything, they were more friendly and accommodating than average. We had a \"junior suite\" (meaning a slightly bigger room with a queen bed & sofa) with a river view, which was quite comfortable. I can't think of a single thing to complain about, other than the lack of an in-room safe, one of my pet peeves. Internet was wireless and free. This is the downtown hotel of choice, as far as we are concerned.",
            "Best thing about the hotel is its location. You're a 90 second walk from Michigan Avenue. The parking is not bad for a downtown Chicago hotel. There is valet service or self-parking. The garage is just north of Michigan Avenue and takes fewer than three minute walk. The Chicago L station is less than a ten minute walk. Our room was small, but nicely appointed. Free wireless access was appreciated. Bed was average and bathroom was clean. Room was pretty dark when the curtains were closed. Staff was friendly. They brought up a luggage cart when we left and delivered toothbrushes when we realized we forgot to pack them. Some things to keep in mind that some may see as negatives, but didn't really bother me because we were there just to sleep. This isn't a full-service hotel. * there's not a convenient circular drive to drive up your car where a bellmen will greet you and take your bags * there is no conceriege service * the lobby is miniscule so checked bags are not readily available (given space constraints) There are only four elevators for this 20+ floor hotel. One was not working the morning we left, so there was a very, very long wait. Signs were present noting their environmental concerns. We hanged the towels as directed, but they were still swapped out, rather than allowing us to reuse them. I hate that. All in all, if you're looking for a moderately priced hotel in downtown Chicago that is close to Michigan Avenue with relatively easy access to parking and the L, this is the place for you. If you're looking for a snazzy business or conference hotel, this will likely disappoint you.",
            "Would stay here again without a second thought if it weren't for the anemic air conditioning that kept room just bearable. Not what you want in the summer. Restaurant in hotel is good for breakfast but best avoided for lunch and dinner for its lackluster menu with inconsistent quality. Pizza had flavorless frozen crust flavor and texture - and its an Italian restaurant in Chicago! Loved the location - loved the modern room aesthetics - again the AC is the bummer.",
            "My husband and I stayed here Wed. through Sun. last week. Previous reviewers complained about the thin walls and small rooms, but we found our room to be fine for two people. Our room was right off of the elevator and the only time we heard people was through the door. I know we had a neighbor, but we never heard anything through the walls. The free cold bottled water in the hallways is a great idea. You do have to go to the basement to get ice though. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. The Italian restaurant downstairs was tasty and reasonable. There is a Corner Bakery a few doors down which is great for breakfast. Booking with Hotels.com gave us a very reasonable rate for a hotel just half a block from Michigan Ave. and a few blocks from the Red and Brown lines. A very easy walk to the Art Institute and Millenium Park.",
            "We spent Father's Day in Chicago. My husband has been a life long Cubs fan so I gave him tickets for a game at Wrigley Field. I was not familiar with Chicago and after researching many locations/hotels I decided on the River Hotel. Best decision!! The hotel is nice with a great staff. When I made the reservation, I asked for a river view and they remembered that request at check in. The room was clean and not as small as people have described. The location is the best. We walked up and down the River Walk, to great restaurants and the train is just a block away. A cab fare to Wrigley field was $11. The staff in the Bella Bacino's restaurant were just great! If you stop in, say Hi to Crystal. We will always stay at the River Hotel when in Chicago. Don't understand the negative reviews - guess not everyone can be pleased.",
            "We stayed at the River Hotel in October 2011 -- were on the fifth floor on a Saturday night. Price enticed us to stay there -- I think it was $149 a night for the one room suite for 3. My husband, our 11-year-old son and I live in the Chicago suburbs and wanted to spend an overnight in the city. Pros: Location! Cannot get any better than Wacker and Michigan if you are going to do the Magnificent Mile, Millenium Park, Loop and Theatre District. Price! Other hotels in the area were charging twice as much. (Note, it does appear that River Hotel is charging more these days, though River Hotel does seem to still be on lower end of nicer hotels.) Refillable Bottled Water stations on each floor -- no biggie when it's zero outside, but big plus when it's 90 and humid. Attentive doorman -- can get you a cab right away when it is zero outside. Nice lobby with a small restaurant/bar. Small but clean rooms. Cons: Small rooms -- I would only recommend this hotel for business travelers or very short stays. There is little room for luggage. Noise at night -- see location. Our room was filled with city sounds at night. Perhaps the higher floors might not have this feature. Overall, a great place for an overnight. We will be back.",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Club Quarters hotels is that the size of the room is part of the experience. How else would a nice looking hotel in prime location offer such inexpensive prices? $130 for me on a Monday night...other hotels (including Hotel 71 next-door) were $299 and above. The hotel facade faces the river (I had a river-facing view, thanks to the great staff, and it was beautiful) and there are plenty of restaurants (the corner bakery cafe next door is fabulous...walked 1 block to the Hard Rock hotel and ate at China Grill). Bed wasn't too comfortable -- it was two twins put together with a foam connector to make a King... -- but I've stayed in my worse. Bathroom doesn't have a ton of counter space, but it was very clean. Wi-fi was free (I was at the tail end of the signal so my speed was very slow). I would stay here again if other, nicer hotels have cheaper rates...but for $130 it well exceeded by expectations.",
            "I stayed in this hotel for a week during a business trip to Chicago and I simply cannot understand the bad reviews. Yes, the size of the room was small, but I only went there to sleep. Everything was always immaculately clean and there is everything you need (including free wireless Internet). Besides, the location of the hotel is second to none, the restaurant downstairs is OK and the service seemed excellent to me. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a five-star rating are the two elevators, which clearly are insufficient for such a number of rooms.",
            "I was here in mid February and I gotta say, it truly is an amazing hotel. Clean, comfortable for the price. I got a great deal at around $89 a night. Right off of Michigan Avenue, convenient location. The staff was amazing. Rooms were so clean and had so much attention to detail. I have read some of the reviews regarding room size and I stayed in one of the smaller rooms available. It was good enough for just me. I was not in the room anyway, only to sleep so I did not care about a large room. I thought the room size was good enough. They offer larger rooms so if you did have a problem witht the room size, you can always upgrade. I recommend this hotel to anyone, for business or pleasure!",
            "This hotel is one of the best kept secrets in Chicago! Yes, the rooms are small and really designed for only one person; however, how much time does anyone really spend in their room? The staff were wonderful, the bed was extremely comfortable, the amenities were the same as what you would expect in a larger and more well-known place. The best part was the location - right in the middle of everything. We were able to walk everywhere with no trouble. If there was any downside, I would have to say it would be the restaurant downstairs - it wasn't one of the best in town, but adequate for breakfast. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Chicago!",
            "I stayed at this hotel for two nights while visiting Chicago on business in September 2007. The location is excellent being between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile. However, the elevators simply do not work properly, and it is not the place to stay should you need to get to and from your room quickly or frequently. I saw several customers have trouble getting to their rooms, and the front desk staff were nonchalant, and would not even allow customers to take the stairs. (This is obviously a persistent problem.) Nevertheless, it is probably good value for your money, and in a good location.",
            "I just returned from a weekend in Chicago to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday - and we stayed at the River Hotel. I cannot believe the bad reviews that some have given this hotel - unless they are just the sort of folks that you cannot make happy no matter what you do. We got to the hotel to check in, and were very quickly assisted by Tim - who was fabulous! When he discovered that we were in town for my daughter's birthday - he fixed us up with a couple of passes into a local club and was super-friendly. :) Our room was on the 10th floor and faced North - so we had THE most beautiful view!! It looked right out over the river and we could also see west down the river across all the bridges. The room was a superior/studio - it was not huge - but the perfect size for the two of us. There was also a sleeper sofa in the room, so it will actually sleep 4 people. The room was immaculately clean - and the bed was super-comfortable. We also ate one night downstairs at Bella Bacino's - and the staff there is also friendly. I had taken two bottles of wine with me and realized that I did not remember the corkscrew and the bartender at the restaurant opened them for me. This hotel is actually one of the more moderately priced hotels in downtown - and I will definitely stay here again when the opportunity presents itself! Great value and a great hotel!!!!! Thanks River Hotel for a memorable weekend!",
            "Sleek hotel in the best location there is in Chicago--right on the Chicago River and Michigan. I had a 10th floor room with a view right down the river with its numerous bridges. The room was really a nice sized room, though it was called a suite. My room was super quiet-I never heard another guest during my 48 hour stay. In fact, though the hotel was full, I never saw another guest on my floor. There was free Wi-Fi access.",
            "Location and cleanliness of the room ar perfect. But first, the staff is really not interested in giving you some tourist information nor do they have documentations to help you on the attractions. Second, I lost a silver ring in my room and when I called 5 hours later, they could not find it... So I seriously doubt about their honesty... Finally, on one night, there was a party of people on my floor and even if I called the front desk twice, they could not warn them to make less noise (even at 5 in the morning). So I could not have a good night sleep. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone..",
            "My husband son and I booked this hotel through the recommendation of my brother who was getting married at the aon center. I booked a room that said it had 2 double beds .When we arrived we found the 2 doubl beds to be two beds pushed together in a room that seemed to be a little bit bigger than a closet. The room we were assigne d never did cool off and with the weather outside being so hot and humid outside it became a huge issue. They eventually gave us another room witch was muchj cooler a slightly larger than the one we had before.The elevator issue really bugged me. It took forever to swipe your card to get the elevator moving. I did like the location because we could just park in a parking garage and then walk or take public transportation if we wanted. Also the desk clerk we dealt with was very helpful. I could not really stand the small rooms so I do not think I would stay there again.",
            "I stayed at the hotel for a week in late August. I knew that rooms were considered small be some reviewers, but I did not find them to be cramped. The check-in/check-out procedure was good. The public areas were fine. I normally had no problem getting to use a computer in the public area. My room was clean and generally well kept by staff. The location is great if you walk, use public transit or the trolley system (paid one) for tourists. The hotel has a small bar and the restaurant is fine. My only concern would be as construction on Trump Tower across the river progresses that noise levels may get high. It was not a problem at my visit. I had a fine few of the Chicago River. My visit was good and I would stay again. it is not an awesome experience, but it did not create stress or disappoint.",
            "My husband booked this hotel for a weekend trip. Thankfully I will only be here 2 nights. It's clean & would be great for a business trip or something like that. It's very tiny & I was on the 17th floor with no view. There is a walk in shower with a very sad shower curtain. The bed is okay, but mine @ home is nicer. It's not terrible, but it just isn't somewhere I would ever stay...ever...& definitely not for an anniversary trip. When we go away it's usually to a place with deluxe accomodations to relax & rejuvenate from our hectic lives & this is not up to my standards. I'm very disappointed. There is a good little italian restaurant connected to it.",
            "This is located by wacker and michigan its a very good location, theres restaurants within close walking distance. Walls are too thin between rooms, I can actually hear the guy next door snore. Room fixtures are basic. Small rooms but adequate. Free bottled water unlimited - great! They should have these plastic bottles recycled though. Free wireless connection Booked through booking.com and paid 95 dollars total for a night. if there are other hotels in the area with lower or comparable price, I might choose the other. If not then I can live with this hotel.",
            "My wife and I were excited to get a weekend away without our kids. The plate was set: Grandma/Grandpa had the kids, our flight was actually on time, easy transit to the hotel from Midway and then we open the door to our room...... It was a stinkin closet!!! There wasn't even room on either side of the bed to walk on. It looked nothing like the pictures that were on the internet. I immediately called and complained. They hesitantly moved us to another room the next day, but I heard from several others that they got the same deal and were not able to be moved. Additionally, due to the \"Linen Man\" moving towels up and down the 2nd elevator, we had to wait 45 min. 2X to get down to the lobby. We were livid and almost missed our flight. Not much for ammenaties at the hotel. Very small italian resteraunt at the bottom floor with a bad menu. Luckily the location was good and easy walking distance to other restaurants. We paid an avg of $200 per night including tax. This was one of the cheapest hotels we could find and now I see why.....",
            "This was a girls trip to a 40th birthday. My girlfriend and I shared the 1 bedroom suite, which was smaller than we thought, but the view was amazing! Called the night before arriving and spoke with the manager (Tim) who was so sweet to take our request (a river view) into consideration. We got it (keep in mind, we checked in on a Thursday night). The staff was so pleasant, the rooms very clean, everything was perfect! I am all about location, and this is the PERFECT area! Lovely restaurant downstairs, a Walgreens right around the corner for spirits, fun little pubs/bars across the street, the River tour right across the street, Magnificent Mile right there, Hancock building a $7 cab ride (go to the top and have lunch/dinner and enjoy the best view of the city), this is one of the cleanest cities I have ever seen (yes, it's the location). Plus, free internet connection! I just love this place, I can afford more, but why pay more? The beds are so comfy also. This was a pleasant surprise. I can't wait to go back! If you are all about sight seeing and not being in the room much, this is the hotel for you! Also, if you can catch the Segway tour, do it! !",
            "Rooms are small. Staff less than friendly. In fact, at check-in the hotel clerk advised me my deposit would be returned to me immediately, but they were not. Its now been 5 days. Why do they get to make interest off my funds, and more important why do I have to pay interest for incidental charges I didn't even incur. Furthemore, we could not even sit in the lounge aea in the restaurant in the bar because it was rented out. Not to mention they were doing filming right in front of the hotel so pretty much every time we went in or out we had to wait anyhere from 10 to 30 minutes. There was no advance warning of this nor even an apology for the inconvenience from the hotel. And don't even get me started about film clean up crew scraping metal to road and the beep beep beep of trucks backing up whle the flm clean up crew worked from approx. 11 pm to 1:30 am. Hmm, do they care about their guests? But the bed was firm and comfortable.",
            "this was a surprisingly comfortable 2 bd 2 bath suite w/a compact kitchen that included 2 burner stove, mini fridge, microwave and service for 4 in the cabinets. Had 3 flat screens, one in each bedroom and one in the common sitting area. king bed in one rm, queen bed in the other. No view. The space was great for the 3 of us and would be good for families. There are no bedroom doors, just partitions, so be aware if complete privacy is needed. Best thing was the terrific location just steps off Mag Mile and close to Millennium Park. tons of restaurants nearby. Walking distance to all of Chicago's downtown attractions or short bus/taxi rides for those who prefer to ride.The rate was quite reasonable-we booked a couple of months in advance. Would absolutely stay again.",
            "My husband and I went to Chicago for our 30th wedding anniversary. He had stayed at the River Hotel for a conference and loved it so we decided to go together. There is nothing negative I can say. This hotel's location is perfect, right on the Chicago River, in easy walking distance to Lake Michigan, Magnificent Mile, Millenium Park, the Art Institute, the Symphony, fabulous restaurants, everything! The CTA from O'Hare lands you just a couple blocks from the hotel's door. Our room overlooked the Chicago River! Very European design in the rooms, small but modern, beautifully appointed. The service was perfect and the price, for some reason, is much better than many of the chain hotels in the area. They even have chilled water dispensers with empty water bottles on every floor. We used this feature constantly. I can't say enough about this perfect little boutique hotel. Even the architecture of the building is stunning!",
            "Our recent stay at The River Hotel started off wonderfully due mostly to the very central location of the hotel between Michigan Ave and Wabash along the river. However we quickly realized that our air conditioning wasn't working. I called the desk three times to report this. They did send up an engineer who confirmed that our unit wasn't working and then disappeared without fixing anything and we never saw him again. It made for a very uncomfortable stay, as our room was 80 degrees with no fresh air the entire time. Upon checkout the lady took off one night's charge for valet in order to try to mitigate my disappointment. I would have rather paid the second night of valet and been more comfortable for the weekend. The service was all very friendly but not terribly helpful. We checked in with many bags and were not offered help from the valets or the front desk with carrying the bags or offering a trolly to push them to our room. The price and location were outstanding, but next time I will pay more and stay somewhere more accomodating.",
            "Having never been to Chicago before I wanted something central, so based on reviews on here I took a chance on the River Hotel. I was not disapointed. From the minute we arrived the staff were very friendly and helpful, and the room was clean, modern and very comfortable. The location of this place is it's greatest selling point, right on the river and central to all the tourist places. I loved the city and I loved this hotel, will be going back to both for sure.",
            "The great location is my favorite aspect of this hotel. Just steps off Michigan Ave., and very near the red line subway. Staff was friendly, rooms are small, but the sheets and pillows are heavenly. Bathroom is also nice. They even had books in the room for you to look at. Would definitely stay again.",
            "We got a great deal staying here and for the price, it may have been one of the best deals EVER! $150 a night for 5 day's while I was in a class at the Sears tower. Elephant & Castle in the hotel for Breakfast was convenient as well. I moved rooms once because of construction noise with no hassle at all. Given the fact it was down town, I was okay with a little extra noise.",
            "The \"Executive\" room was tiny - barely room to walk around the bed to get to the window. The wireless internet access didn't work. The TV remote didn't work (it was broken on the TV end). And those are the only two amenities. The elevators are finicky and you have to press the buttons just right to get them to work. To get to the gym or vending machines, you take two separate elevators into a creepy, gross, dirty basement. (One is the freight elevator.) When I asked for a rate reduction because of the problems, first I was scolded by the front desk clerk who said I should have reported the TV problem the night before. (I had - they couldn't fix it.) She also said the wireless had been down for 2 days (not mentioned when i checked in, however.) Then she said they wouldn't adjust the rate (over $200!) because I had booked online, via Hotels.com. Hotels.com will only offer \"hotel bucks\" towards a future booking, but i can't imagine using them ever again, knowing that hotels don't provide the same level of customer service as they do if you book direct.",
            "We really enjoyed our stay here! We chose it because it was the cheapest we could find in downtown Chicago and totally lucked out. The location was perfection: close to everything we wanted to see, as well as transportation. We even had two views of the Chicago River from our room! The room wasn't huge, but it was well laid out and we had enough space for our needs. Attractive furnishings and no ugly floral bedspreads! Yeay! Super clean. I'm usually skeeved out by several aspects of most hotel rooms but can whole-heartedly recommend this place. Oh, and they had cookies in lobby during the afternoon. How can you not love that?",
            "Working in Chicago the Club Quarters on Wacker was notably cheap on my company travel agents list and it was local to where I would be working so I tried it. The building is quite impressive upon arrival - a grand old brownstone building with polished brass appointments. Check in staff were very friendly and efficient. The room was very disappointingly small: it was too small really to work in comfortably. However there's free wireless and a small desk to work at. I had to keep the curtains drawn all the time because the window was not double glazed and felt like it was open, such was the loss of heat through it to the Chicago winter outside. Not great. Bed was comfortable. Coffee machine but no minibar, which wasn't very convenient. There is an Italian themed restaurant : Bacino's : just outside the foyer that serves as a hotel restaurant. Food was OK , atmosphere and service quite, quite excellent in the evening. An oddity was that I wanted to hire a conference room during my stay and I had to contact the catering manager at Bela Bacino's.. ... I was unsuccessful, and had to meet my customer in another hotel instead. Finally I had to check out early and found an early checkout charge. Fair enough I guess, but that's the first time I have ever encountered this is a business hotel. It was an OK stay, but with so many better , more spacious hotels available in Chicago I see no reason to stay there again.",
            "Room was well worth the money. Valet was very accommodating and pleasant. Perfect location right off corner of Wacker & Michigan Ave along river. GoChicago cards and info right across street. River taxis go between Michigan Ave and Navy Pier. House of Blues right across river. Room was small but very clean. Nothing fancy, but still nice.",
            "This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a \"late checkout\"? Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it? Well, this hotel charges $35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel.",
            "I had a Mommy-runaway-for-the-weekend trip Mar 30-Apr 2, 2006 and stayed in a \"Director's Room.\" Queen-sized bed, two bedside tables, arm chair, desk and chair, little closet, little bathroom with slightly oversized shower. I was alone and out of the room most often so the size was fine. A professional membership got me the room for $76/night which, for right-in-the-middle-of-everything-Chicago isn't bad at all. I walked to the Art Institute, the Symphony, the Ann Taylor Loft store, and the House of Blues without a problem. Parking on the next block was $20+ a day without in/out. As a woman alone, I wasn't wild about the subterranean parking garage, but it was well lit and there was an ancient man acting as a guard. The little restaurant downstairs was terrific and I ate there both nights. Try the asparagus and prosciutto salad with a glass of Valpolicella and the white pizza. There's a coffee shop just outside the hotel that was delicious. Overall, it's not a luxury hotel, the rooms aren't huge, but the room had the necessities and a nice view.",
            "I arrived on Monday 23 April in the Evening, after a long haul flight from Dublin to Chicago O'Hare. Stayed Six nights. Got the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) Blue Line into Clark and Lake Station. After a long flight, it was a relief to find such a quiet, clean and cosy hotel. some other reviews said rooms here were small, but i thought my room fine for two, even though i had the double bed room to myself. Hotel is well located for seeing the sights of Chicago and shopping is within walking distance on State Street (Best for bargains) and Michigan Avenue (High End Shopping). Check out the Italien American Restaurent on the Ground Floor. Excellent Breakfasts, and evening meals are very good too. Other good eateries Seafood, Steak, etc.are in the immediate neighbourhood. Other Plus Points- Complimentary Internet Access for Residents. Ask the Concierges anything. They are very helpful, in particular, Kevin and Tim. They certainly know their city!",
            "We three gals booked the two bedroom suite well in advance so we got an unbelievable rate. I'd be hard pressed to think of a better location-access to North Mich, Millenium Park/Art Institute, the Loop, the Riverwalk...the room was beautifully appointed, great bathrooms, comfortable bedding, kitchenette, quiet...no view from the 2 BRs but that wasn't of particular concern to us. It does share an entrance with Club Quarters but I'm not sure they're actually affiliated with each other so the comments about Club Quarters may not apply. Though we were doing the girlfriend thing this suite would also be great for two couples who don't require tons of privacy- there's no door - and terrific for a family group that would be accomodated by one king and one queen bed. The sitting area was great for hanging out and though we only used the kitchen to store beverages and snacks I could see bringing take out up there, heating up leftovers, etc. There's a Corner Bakery right next door, also a huge plus for the early morning coffee run-though there were also in-room coffee makers. Another nice touch was filtered water & water bottles you could fill up in the hallway. I would stay there again in a heartbeat! Just reserve far in advance for a really good rate.",
            "Booked hotel on Orbitz. Asked for adjoining rooms. Advised to call hotel direct for that. Spoke to Virginia at hotel on 3 separate occasions. She said adjoining rooms weren't available but we could get rooms that were next to each other. Got to hotel early & was told check in was at 3. Went back to hotel at 3:45, only to be told rooms weren't ready. Hotel staff wouldn't promise a room, although we had already paid Orbitz. Hotel staff said we should have booked directly w/the hotel. After lots of frustration and anger we were finally placed in a suite with two BR & two baths. We were traveling with our son, daughter-in-law, two small grandchildren & our daughter. (Had booked a smoking room for her) Once in the suite, we determined it wasn't large enough for all of us. At that point my husband & I were placed in a standard room (had booked a suite), which wasn't next to our family as requested. Our original hotel was Club Quarters. Virginia had moved us to the River Hotel because she said 'It was newer'. Smoking is only allowed at Club Quarters, so we weren't even in the same hotel as our daughter. She couldn't come to our room/hotel & we couldn't go to hers because the elevators are operated by room keys. The next day we tried the hotel's small restaurant for breakfast. Our granddaughter ordered chocolate milk and french toast. We were informed they had no chocolate for the milk and were out of french toast. All in all, it was VERY frustrating for our whole family. Also, when we asked to speak to management on the first day, we were informed that no one was available until Mon. What a mess this turned out to be! We will DEFINITELY never stay at this place again! !",
            "My friend and I arrived early and we were able to check in right away. The room was small but very managable.. The beds were comfortable. There was free purified water on our floor with water bottles so we were able to fill and go.. I would stay there again, for leisure.. The location was awesome, was able to walk every where.. We were near trump tower, the Michigan Ave bridge and not far from Grant Park.. I enjoyed the hote and the staff. Laundry service for those that need to wash something and btw they were not coin operated..the hotel even had detergent in the room that you could use.. The elevators were alittle slow, but all in all a great hotel..",
            "I took my 6 year old daughter to Chicago for an end of summer vacation. This hotel was perfect for us! We got a room with 2 twin beds for $139 (plus tax, which for Chicago is really high). The location was a block away from the free trolley stop (which takes you to the museums, Marshall Fields, Navy Pier, etc.) , and right across the river from several boat tour options. There is also a Corner Bakery right next door which was great for breakfast and lunch. There's so much to do within just a few blocks. We were on the 21st floor and had an outstanding view of the river. I feel like we just could not have done better than this hotel. Yes, the room is small, but it had everything we needed.",
            "This is a decent hotel for business travelers. A very nice feature is the nice business center and free use of the printer. However, the printer was broken for much of my stay and the wi-fi is weak if you stay in the towers. Also, the staff are very hit-or-miss. I firmly believe that you shouldn't judge the quality of a hotel based on interaction with one or two staff, but many of the staff were unwelcoming and treated guests as if they were a hassle. The rooms are small, but adequate. The price is reasonable. The location is really very nice...just off the magnificent mile. You can walk to everything.",
            "location - can't do better than this - just off Michigan Ave and straddling the Loop and Magnificent Mile plus there is a fabulous Italian Restaurant on site Price - very competitive Rooms - fine - some great views history - one of Chicago's really interesting and historic buildings - stay in the tower overlooking the river for business - great board rooms and plenty of computer stations (never a line up) and free printing staff - very good beds - not the same comfort that you'd get at the Hilton",
            "River Hotel was really an amazing experience as a boutique hotel. I was in town for biz and booked through Amex package to secure a really great rate. I was upgraded to a suite with river views upon check-in, which made my life much better. Apparently other rooms are signifcantly smaller, or have poor views, also no in house mini fridge. I was there for a week so these amenities were crucial for me. The internet was great, bed small and firm, but nice. I liked upgraded bathroom as well. The rooms are certainly tiny, but you are in downtown Chicago at a great rate and with incredible views. This isn't your typical boxy corporate hotel - enjoy it! Valet parking was an added cost that I was not expecting, but it wasn't so bad - and I really enjoyed having my car pulled around for me and put away for me. As I was rushing to work each morning it made life SO much easier than trying to find parking or pay way too much for a garage 10 blocks away.",
            "Across the street/river from Trump Tower, close to Millenium Park, Magnificent Mile, Willis Tower, John Hancock Observatory and downtown shopping. We also walked to Shedd Aquarium and Navy Pier. The United Centre (hockey/basketball) was 6 miles so it was a short cab ride. We had a suite since there was three of us and we needed the sofa bed.Great kitchenette with microwave and fridge. Clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful. We'll definitely stay here next time we travel to Chicago.",
            "We've been to Chicago several times and I think this hotel stay was my favorite. Other travelers complain about the small rooms, but I would gladly give up space for the beautiful river view we had. We enjoyed having a microwave and refrigerator in our room and the free wireless internet was a great plus. True- the elevators were a bit slow in the morning because of the cleaning staff using the same 2 elevators as the guests, but I planned for it and was never late for anything. My spouse, 2 friends and myself spent a week there in July would all highly recommend this hotel.",
            "The hotel was in walking distance of most major attractions- parks, museums and shopping. Our room was on the 21st floor and we had a great view of the river. The rooms were small, but comfortable. The food at the restaurant was very good. We took the train from the airport (only $2.25 each) and the hotel was about 5-6 blocks away from where we got off. For the price we paid and the amount of time we spent in our room this was a great deal.",
            "My boyfriend and I are in college and went to Chicago for spring break. This hotel was perfect. Right on Wacker and Michigan avenue...in the heart of the city. We walked everywhere! The staff was very helpful, we arrived at 10 am and got to check in early and the concierge helped us figure out where to eat lunch and where to begin our day. It's incredibly clean and safe. You have to have your key in order to use the elevator. The rooms aren't small, they are just long and narrow. I could foresee it being a problem for someone who wants to relax at the hotel, but it is still very nice...and who goes to Chicago to lay around in the hotel room anyway? I'm an architecture major and would like to note that this hotel is in the historic lincoln tower, a 40 story structure which used to be the cities largest skyscraper...( many many years ago obviously!) Also, the beds have down comforters, the bathroom is quite large, looks newly remodeled and has a great shower. The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that the wireless internet went in and out a few days that we were there. We called the front desk and they said it had been happening lately and they didn't know why...so perhaps it has been fixed now. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel for just about anyone who wants to be right in the center of downtown Chicago.",
            "The hotels locaton is wonderful, but the rooms are tiny. I have never seen hotel rooms this small in the United States. The hotel is in a beautiful historic beaux arts office building, but the room have the charm of a dorm. The bathroom only had a shower and the closet was the size of a phone booth. The television is too small to see from the bed. The bedding was cheap. Room was very clean and in excellent condition. Elevators were very slow and required room card to operate. The sheer size of the room made it difficult for two people to share. Staff was very accommodating.",
            "a great little hotel right in the heart of chicago and within walking distance of all the attractions chicago has to offer.Compared to other hotels in and around the area, I thought I got and absolute bargain through Expedia. Checked in within minutes and checked out in even less time by charming and helpful staff. Free computers to use,plus special computer to print out flight home boarding passes. Start your long day with a breakfast in restaurant just 50 metres away,or hotel restaurant. I would not hesitate to stay there again. One tip if you go up the Sears or Hancocks towers make sure its a cloudless day,if the clouds are low you wont see a thing!",
            "This hotel is in a perfect location to downtown Chicago - couldn't ask for better! The public transportation/train system is excellent and the hotel is a short 5-10 minute walk to many of the lines. I took the train from O'Hare and it was super easy ! My room was a basic Club Quarters room - standard amenities. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would most definately stay there again on my next trip to Chicago -",
            "Stayed here for two nights to visit Chicago. It was confusing to find details on the Internet because Club Quarters and River Hotel are both in the same building - not quite sure what the difference is but there were two reception desks. Many attractions, restaurants and bars are within walking distance and the public transport links are good. The room was nice with a huge bed and decent bathroom but there was no place to put your case other than on the ground. No hotel safe either. The check-in staff were mixed, one very friendly and helpful and the other disinterested. Overall I would recommend this hotel for the location and the price.",
            "We stayed at Club Quarters in December. We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked. Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district. If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your room? The rooms were clean and thats really most important. When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in. We were told we could valet park for $36.00 or for $20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street. We opted for the $20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!! My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it. Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back. The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time. After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel. We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great. Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave.",
            "If I thought I could find another hotel room this close to The Mart during NeoCon I'd check out. The room looked very nice at first glance. Then I noticed the bathroom floor not only hadn't been washed, it hadn't even been swept! A call to housekeeping produced no results. I've always been wary of using hotel provided glasses....have you ever actually seen a rack of clean glasses on the maid's cart to replace the used ones in the room??? Well ours still had the lipstick smears from prior guests. YUCK! I can't call a dirty room at any price a good value. \"Sleepless from Seattle\"",
            "I usually stay here when I am in Chicago for business. The rooms are small but comfortable and clean. The bathroom is a extremely small but updated. This hotel is in a great location, walking distance to the magnificent mile. Great value for the location.",
            "Fantastic location but for $200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere.",
            "We just returned from two nights in Chicago with a stay at this hotel. We've been to Chicago numerous times, but these accomodations were, by far, the best yet. We had booked on Priceline.com and when I called the hotel to inquire about additional sleeping accomodations because there were four of us...they upgraded us (for just an additional $30 each night) to a suite. The suite was room 410 and room 411 combined. We had two beds, a flip out chair/couch, two refrigerators, two bathrooms, two desks a microwave and PLENTY of room. Although this hotel caters to business travelers, the location and awesome arrangement made for a great family weekend. The room was newly remodeled, and everything was top-notch. The decor was very modern and tasteful. This location, on the corner of Michigan and Wacker really cannot be beat. You are within blocks of the Mag. Mile, a 2 minute walk to the subway, about 10 min. from Navy Pier, a couple of minutes from State Street shopping!!! We arrived early on July 3rd, and were allowed to check-in before noon. On the day we left, they held our luggage so we could walk around and enjoy some shopping before we had to catch the train. Now I feel spoiled, and really won't want to stay any other place when we visit Chicago.",
            "My girlfriend and I stayed here New Year's day evening to experience some of downtown Chicago's treats. It was perfectly situated between the shopping north of the river and the cultural offerings due south off Michigan. Rooms are as you expect in a city -- small -- but the bed was clean and comfortable and we had a view of the river. The hotel was quiet this evening after the holiday weekend and the concierge was very helpful in getting us a taxi at 4:30 am to catch an early flight back west.",
            "I stayed here for three days while working on a book about Chicago. The location is perfect, on the north end of the Loop and foot of the Mag Mile, buses at the door and the el just a few blocks away. I had a Tower room (just 2 on the floor and the other was empty) so it was very quiet. Staff was friendly and efficient. Housekeeping forgot to service my room one day but a call to the desk brought a housekeeper within minutes. Free WiFi throughout the hotel and a good business center. Strongly recommended for business travelers, good for couples or singles, OK for families with older kids.",
            "This was to say the least the most dissapointing hotel room I have EVER seen. It was so small , no room at all in the tiny bathroom and stand up shower only.The end of the bed was less than 12 incehes from the wall so to get to the tv you had to scoot sideways to go to that side of the room. I never write reviews but this was ridiculous !! This was the superior room .......whatever that means .LOL",
            "Perfect hotel for a single female traveller. The hotel was clean, convenient, and steps away from major attractions. Easy to access by public transportation. The room is smaller than average, but not too small, and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway. Computers with internet access a plus. Friendly staff. The only gripe I had was the elevators...there are only two of them, so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive.",
            "This hotel is the best value going. I'm a seasoned traveller so I have seen it all. Yes the rooms are smaller than normal but how much do you need when your so close to all the attractions. Plus they are like new inside. Went during the middle of the week so didn't have any problems with elevators or staff like some other reviewers had mentioned. The front desk let me check in at 11am so that was a plus, and I used the computer and printer in the upstairs lounge for printing boarding passes. For 85 bucks you can't beat it.",
            "Couldn't ask for a much better location if you want to stay in downtown Chicago and be able to walk around. PROS ============= - Fantastic location. Right next to Michigan Ave. Bridge with the Wrigley Building right across the river. - Very affordable given the location. (Of course, we went for the 4th of July and this is a business hotel chain.) - Cheap and tasty place to have breakfast just outside the hotel. (Corner Bakery Cafe) - Don't need a car if you plan to stay in Chicago. Close to lots of transit. CONS ============= - My wife and I went to Chicago for our honeymoon. Loved the town, but this hotel is not the most romantic. - Somewhat spartan accommodations",
            "The River Hotel occupies floors 3 - 10 of a historic building built in 1928. It is located directly across the street (Whacker) from the Chicago river between Michigan ave and Wabash. In terms of location, this place could not be beat in my opinion. Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park, 'L' trains, many restaurants and bars, all within walking distance. We chose not to rent a car and got around just fine. Additionally, we found the rooms to be clean, comfortable, nicely updated, and good size for a hotel in a downtown area of a major city. If we make it back to Chicago again, this is were we'll stay.",
            "Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel. The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted. Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested. Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there. My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city. All in all a great expericen for the price.",
            "Very nice hotel, everything was nice and the staff was very helpful. My only complaint was how exceedingly small my single room was. It worked fine, but there truly was very little room within the room. Oh, and perhaps that is the reason the bed seemed short even for my 5'-4\" height?! ?",
            "River Hotel is priced like most Chicago hotels - expensive - almost 200/night, but doesn't deliver anywhere near the service expected for that service. Most disappointing was the room - it was barely could fit in the queen bed that was in there. Its almost as if they cut the rooms in half some time ago to maximize occupancy. It was evident this is what they did as the the dividers between rooms were paper thin - I could here everything happening in the next room including people talking. Most motel chains like Best Westerns etc. have better room size so go there for a 1/3 of the money. Or spend the 200/night and go somewhere else. Further the maid service people knocked at my door around noon - I asked them to come back - they never did."

            "I just came back from Rome after spending 4 nights in Cicerone. I would say this hotel deserves maybe 3 and a half or almost 4 stars. Location is just excellent - walking distance to Trinita dei Monti, Piaza Navona, Trastevere, Campo do Fiori, Vaticano, Fontana di Trevi, Pantheon. I walked and walked every day and it was really comfortable to stay in Cicerone to reach all those places in a very short time. Breakfast was rather average then good although the buffet was full of products. My room was placed on the 8th floor (attic) so the lift goes to 7th floor only and then stairs, what was no problem at all for me - I could walk even more for this low price which was half price then - special price. Rooms in the attic were rather small, but comfortable enough, bathroom was also O.K. besides the shower tube was not working good. There where rather small windows in the top part of the room, but it was not important to me to have big windows as I spent each day outside of the room. Generally good hotel with some negative points.",
            "We stayed at this property on Oct 22,2006 for 1 nite. We went sight seeing for 4 hrs. During this time you turn in your key and retrieve it upon return of your tours etc. We locked our wallet and personal papers in the locked safe. Upon check-out we discovered money missing from the wallet. Thinking we made a mistake we boarded our plane and flew home. When I checked my credit card I discovered they had also stolen my husband;s card and proceeded to use it on the day of our departure. Fortunately I had notified our cc company as to my date of return and flagged the card. When you turn your key back to the front desk they know who is coming and going and for maybe how long. Therefore they can gain entry to the rooms and have passcodes to the safe. As I am a property manager I do know how this works. Therefore we will only stay at properties with electronic locks that can be traced or keep the key with us. DO NOT , turn in your keys unless you are checking out of any property. This is a green light for robbery. The property itself was nice but the security is faulty. I did notify the GM regarding this matter and the cruiseline that booked us there to investigate.",
            "4 star? well the beautiful hotel next door was definitely 4 star - maybe more - but the Cicerone falls far short. Main problem is lack of invetsment so I guess it belongs to some group or an investment firm whose managers stay some place else. The rooms that have become too dirty or threadbare have had their carpets removed and that begets a sound problem... For goodness sake - go buy a rug. Breakfast was dismal - a good enough looking selection of continental style ingredients but standard very poor and the coffee undrinkable. The location is good and the hotel probably survives on that alone.",
            "We stayed a few nights at this hotel as a part of a tour group. The hotel staff seemed put off or indifferent to answer questions many travelers may have. The internet site on the main floor may or may not work, again, the hotel staff couldn't be bothered with that trivial matter. The rooms were clean and well maintained and was quite comfortable. Breakfasts were OK, and we never did eat in the main dining room or bar. Overal, this hotel is well kept, clean, and comfortable. Hotel Cicerone is situated in a great location. There are a number of gelato shops and restaurants nearby. An outdoor market is not far. Around the corner from Cicerone is a nice coffee shop which has much better cappucino than the hotel. Cicerone is within a short walking distance from Castle S. Angelo, The Vatican, and Piazza Novona. Across the street is a quaint pizzaria for a quick meal. I've had better house wine, but pleasant to sit outdoors and enjoy a meal. Despite the neutral attitude of the hotel staff, I would recomend this hotel, and would definately stay there again.",
            "Hotel is a 10 minute, easy walk to the central Piazza and not far from Vatican City. Was there for 2 nights as part of a tour, so did not try the restaurant onsite. We did get a breakfast buffet that was good, with a lot of choice. Hotel is old, feels like the 70's, but very clean. Front desk staff is accomodating. Rugs in the rooms are old and like sandpaper! Room size is not bad for a European hotel.",
            "Room 745 in the Cicerone (and perhaps others) is like a sauna if the temperature is over 50. The answer is,\" turn off the heat and open the window. There is no air conditioning in Italy until May\". We are smart enough to know to turn off the heat! We opened the window and the curtains in the hope of getting a tiny breeze (which over looks a courtyard, so we sacrificed privacy). It was a sweat box at any time, day or night. This is a sophisticated, busy hotel and there is no excuse for them not finding a solution to this problem, even if it means turning on the a/c.",
            "This was my first trip overseas and being a very particular person, I was quite concerned that the European hotels would not be comfortable. I was VERY happily surprised by the Cicerone! The room was larger than expected, though it did have twin-sized beds. I was actually quite comfortable and they provided me with the number of pillows that I requested immediately. The closet was exceedingly small, but they gave me tons of extra clothes hangers and there was a cul-de-sac in the wall that we used for folded garments and even our suitcases. All in all, more than enough space to be comfortable. The bathroom was larger than those in most American hotels and was very clean. Lots of counter space and we had no trouble storing our toiletries. We didn't eat at the restaurant as there are SO many fantastic options within TRUE walking distance. But we did have a pre-dinner drink every night at the bar. Gianni (spelling?) is the BEST bartender I've ever seen. Funny, professional and informative. He had me hooked on an Italian apertif called Martini Bianco. Try it on ice! Your room key is on a huge brass ball and you drop it off at the front desk as you leave each day. The funny thing, is that anyone can ask for any room key and RECEIVE it! I did this deliberately just to see what would happen. Oh well, the in-room safe worked and I never, ever felt uncomfortable. I've read a lot of poor reviews about the breakfast buffet and I can't say the food was the best but there was never a line and we enjoyed the juice, melba toast and other pastries. I'd highly recommend just walking into a local bar for a coffee and pastry instead. Very inexpensive. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone and that's very high praise coming from me!",
            "This hotel is well located and the lobby looks exactly like the photo on this web. But the rooms in the photo appear large and they are not. They are small. The air conditioning was shut off at 9 p.m. one of the two nights there and not turned back on til 9 a.m. the next morning. That day the temperatures reached 87 degrees and to say that the room was stuffy is an understatement. The staff could be very friendly or arrogant. Ice Machine was broken for a period of time as well and when I went to the bar to beg for some ice I was told that if he gave me ice, then he couldn't work, so NO. There is no courtyard or rooftop area to relax in when you are not touring or running around. I would not return to this hotel. For the price that we paid, Cicerone did not meet our expectations.",
            "Staying at the Cicerone Hotel was great for a solo female traveler. I felt very safe in this area of Rome both during the day and at night. However, it is also advisable for couples or couples with older children. The hotel is located within easy walking distance of the Vatican and St. Angelo's Castle. You can cross the bridge in front of the castle and catch a hop on/hop off bus on the street corner for a 2 hour ride through the city. The concierge is fantastic. He will make excellent recommendations for restaurants and for shopping, depending on your budget. Also, he is very willing to call a cab for a quick ride to any desired location. My only complaint was the fairly small size of my hotel room, but the bathroom was average size. However, that would not stop me from staying here again as I did not go to Rome to stay in my room.",
            "My first stay at Hotel Cicerone was 1989, I've never stayed any where else in the center of Rome since. I was there again on business early Jan. 2012, greeted by the friendly familiar team at the front desk, my room was clean, as always, and very reasonable. Gianni and Marco at the bar are extremely helpful, professional and \"good guys\"! Great location, great staff and reasonable I will continue to book at Cicerone! Pete Ettinger Albuquerque, NM USA",
            "Positives: Good location, within walking distance to St. Peter's Square & Castel de San Angelo. Hotel room was very clean. Good buffet breakfast selection. Reception staff efficient. Restaurants, ATMs and shops nearby. Has a bar that opens til late. Negatives: Room I stayed in was directly opposite the lifts and front windows faced out onto the street so it got a bit noisy. I could hear the traffic on the street and people outside waiting for lift. However, other friends had rooms towards back of the hotel away from the street and lifts so their rooms were very quiet.",
            "Perfect location between The Vatican & Piazza Navona! Very clean, Great AC! Defies rule of thumb to deduct a star from hotel expectations in Italy: Cicerone should be 4 stars! Breakfast average & busy, but sufficient,and coffee served however you like it. Cicerone staff were helpful,friendly, & efficient. Great hotel and great value for money. Would definitely stay there again if in Rome! A few reviews complain about hard wood floors in the rooms. I was absolutely thrilled - the floor is well-maintained and much more easily cleaned than carpetting = hygenic improvement. It, also, makes it feel a bit cooler during the summer heatwaves. Restaurants within walking distance. Checked-in hungry at 11:30 p.m., concierge phoned Ambasciatore di Capri restaurant around the corner to stay open to feed us. Sneered at the tourist menu, but the food was fresh & delicious, decent wine, and not over priced. More eateries on Via Cola di Rienzo, & on side streets toward Piazza Cavour. Tip: October 2006, Rome passed a fixed fee ordinance for airport taxis into the city [Ciampino 30 euros,FCO 40]. But there\u2019s no enforcement! Taxis want double that to pay for their return to the airport. Airport bus to Termini (train station) 6 euros, than taxi 15 euros to Cicerone. Inquire if the hotel arranged taxi pick-up if it would be cheaper. If not, and you\u2019re arriving late, with small children or have mobility issues, best bet is to pay the doubled taxi rate.",
            "Concierge was rude, reception staff even ruder. One of the lifts didnt work. The hall carpet was badly worn. The photos pictured on their website is nothing like the reality. Rooms were decrepit. Whole place needed upgrading. No free internet. Worst hotel we stayed at in Italy",
            "The best point to the Cicerone is its location between the Vatican and shopping areas and the old city centre. For Italy, the coffee was exceptionally poor and tasteless (both in the breakfast room and using room service). The room air conditioning didnt work. We stayed afterwards at the Milton Roma which was also 4-star but a much better price, better standard (flat screen tvs, brand new, great breakfast) and a higher league of satisfaction and service.",
            "This hotel was very nice. The rooms were a decent size. Most of the staff was extremely friendly except one woman. The breakfast was nice. They offered a variety of foods. They had scrambled eggs and bacon along with a ton of pasties and yogurt. The hotel was within a 20 minute walk of most of the best sites. They offered Internet and the prices varied. We paid $17 euros for 24 hours and having brought our laptop we could use it in our room. They also offered Internet down in the lobby for about the same price. This was quietest room (hotel) of all that we had on our trip.",
            "We just returned from a pre-cruise stay in Rome at the Cicerone Hotel. We were pleased at the accommodations, service and location of this hotel. One word of advise, the hotel does not provide wash clothes, as do many hotels in Europe so bring your own if you wish to have one for bathing. The hotel was booked independently from the cruise. We discovered that our cruise line and the tour companies, Globus and Trafalgar also use the hotel for their clients when in Rome. Our room was clean and large enough for the 3 of us. The air conditioning worked very well, helping us to beat the hot Rome summer temperatures. The hotel's location is about a 15-20 walk to Vatican City. There are plenty of stores for shopping plus cafes and restaurants nearby or a short walk from the hotel. ATM's are readily available on the streets. We booked Travel Bound for our transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the ship at the end of our stay in Rome. Travel Bound was reliable, prompt, courteous and less cost than the cruise line transfers that were offered. This hotel is a good choice for your stay in Rome.",
            "Positive: (1) this hotel is really well-located on the Vatican side of the river. Provided you are reasonably fit, it is possible to walk to most of the major tourist attractions in Rome. (2) It is a competively priced hotel Negative: (1) the hotel does not really deserve to be called a 4* hotel - whilst clean, the fixtures and fittings are very tired (carpets threadbare etc) and very dated. Breakfast is very average. (2) Service is, at best, impersonal and, at worst, poor. This particularly applies to front desk staff who could not have been less interested in serving guests. However, even they were outdone by the barman in hotel bar who was both petty and obnoxious. Someone really needs to remind him that hotel guests pay his wages....",
            "Stayed here 1 night. Very close to Vatican City. 2 Internet machines available at a cost. Hotel food is pretty good. Rooms are quite small. Bathroom is decent, but shower is very small. Water temperature was impossible to control (read: scalding). Didn't visit bar (we were out on the town!! ).",
            "Don't stay here unless you want to be ripped off for your valuables. Spent 2 nights here and while we were out to dinner in the evening, after having turned our key in at reception desk, someone entered our room and stole our camera, and 300.00 cash out of the hotel safe. Obviously a staff member as no forced entry. Front desk was indifferent, said I wasn';t the first person and only offered to assist in getting a police report. When we offered the scenario and our opinion that it had to be a hotel employee, didn't want to listen. We are well travelled, and aware of the dangers of pickpockets in Rome etc, but never expected to be robbed in a secure environment.",
            "After the rain and cold temperatures of Dublin proved to be too much for our summer vacation, we decided to take a short trip to Rome and booked the Cicerone last minute for an excellent price. The Cicerone is a perfectly adequate hotel for a short stay. As this was my fourth time in Rome, I can say with some authority that the Cicerone is well-situated in a safe area - within walking distance of many Rome attractions, including the Vatican. We did, however, take taxis over to the area where the Colosseum, etc. are located due to heat and time considerations. The rooms are clean but not particularly contemporary in terms of decor - in fact, the entire feel of the hotel is as if you are in 1970's Rome not 2008's Rome. The rooms are fairly large for a European hotel, though, and there were plenty of towels, etc. My partner noted that the breakfast was not spectacular. if you are looking for a well-located, reasonably-priced hotel for a short stay in Rome, the Cicerone is not a bad choice.",
            "The elevator goes to the 7th floor but our room is on the 8th floor? Yes, just for you, you get to hoof it up a flight of stairs to get to your room. Did I mention that the heat doesn't turn off and the air conditioning doesn't come on until the entire hotel switches gears? Who knows when that is - who cares - it was an oven when we stayed there. We opened our screenless windows to cool the room down. Did we sleep well knowing our windows were open and we were located on a flat roof top? How about that noise all night long...would you get any sleep? It was cooler in the hallway than our room but we just couldn't bring ourselves to camping in the hallway. The \"concierge\" couldn't help me locate a street address where I was to meet a Vatican tour group and I believe the internet access was not free. The employees behind the counter seemed to be annoyed whenever you stood there waiting to be helped. All this, my fellow travelers, and you paid a lot of money for it also! Oh, and it seemed to be filled with American touristas - there was no expresso or capucino at breakfast and the breakfast buffet was boring, boring, boring. (the coffee was awful, the hotel is ancient)",
            "The Cicerone is fine and clean, but with limited or dated facilities. The buffet breakfast can be busy, but there is a 4 hour window to pick your time. An idea is to go to the Vatican early, St Peter's opens at 7, and come back for breakfast, to aviod queues at each. The bar is dreary bling, and avoid the Roman house wine on offer. The SIT shuttle bus from Fiumicino stops at the Piazza Cavour, only 3 mins from hotel. It is 15 euros return. The best restaurants are over the river (Ponte Cavour), such as Gusto and Il Leoncino.",
            "...don't let them put you in room 140. Our room was directly located above the delivery entrance for the hotel. We were woken at 5:15 in the morning by the horrendous sound of carts rolling in and out of the hotel and on and off of a truck, delivering sheets and towels. This went on for ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES. When we complained and asked to be moved, the wouldn't do it, assuring us we wouldn't be disturbed the next day (and we weren't -because the next day was Sunday, when there wasn't a laundry delivery). The rooms are nice (great bathrooms), breakfast food palatable, staff polite, and there are great restaurants and shopping nearby. Just don't let them put you in Room 140!",
            "Stayed at the cicerone in rome for two nights between christmas and new year, it was great value with a large clean room close to the vatican. We walked everywhere from the hotel, to the colloseo, forum, vatican and trevi fountain pantheon etc all walking. although we did have tired feet it was easy access to every attraction and a ten euro taxi ride to the station. The hotel itself is quiet and comfortable and well preiced for its location, breakfast included which was pretty good for a continental buffet (i particularly enjoyed the cold meats first thing) the hotel staff are moderatly friendly, in a particularly italian manner. Our room was veryy spacious with a nice shower and bathroom, two twin beds, though not enough pillows (only two provided for the two beds) it did get a little cold overnight with the temprature contol proving a little tempremental. On the whole i would recomend the cicerone and should i revist rome in the future will be sure to check its availability again, its a reasonable hotel, well priced close to all atractions and hassle free.",
            "Our arrival in Rome was a disaster, as taxi I had booked didn't turn up and there was a taxi strike on. When we eventually arrived at the Cicerone, it was wonderful. Rooms were large and airy, bathroom was immaculate. Air conditioning was very effective and couldn't have survived without it. This hotel was within easy walking distance of all the sites, but make sure to take comfortable walking shoes. We had no problems with staff and the restaurant staff were very pleasant and friendly. Buffet breakfast was great and you could eat as much as you wanted. Only complaint is that there was no form to fill in for the mini bar, so we really didn't have an accurate account of what was used. We would most certainly stay there again and would recommend it to anyone.",
            "Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my mother and my friend, and we had a lovely time there! Very friendly hotel personal at the reseption - all our questions were answered quickly and allways very politely and with a smile. Our flight was leaving late at night so we left our luggage at the hotel after checking out and it worked just fine. The rooms we were staying in were nicely spacious, clean and had everything we needed. Just slightly outdated, spesially the bathrooms, but we aren't huge fans of everything modern so we could live with that. I have to mention that rooms facing the street are just a little bit noisier and have no balcony, the other side rooms had the balconies but there was really not much to see from them and if the balcony door was left open I could hear the noise from the brekfast area in the morning. Breakfast buffet was amazing - lot's of variety and we found everything we wanted! The location of the hotel was good, within a walking distance from all the main attractions of Rome and the city centre with lots and lots of restaurants. It was much more quiet and peaceful on the left side of the river during the night time so we got to sleep really well! Also the metro station was quite close to the hotel. The internet was unfortunatly not free so we had to buy a time ticket to use it in the lobby, but it was reasonably priced.",
            "Overall this hotel was great. The location was central to all the key sights downtown as well as many local cafes and fine restaurants. We stayed during the World Cup finals and could hear some street noise during the night, but not bad considering. The rooms were very nice, clean, and comfortable; no complaints at all. The only negative that we noticed was how oddly rude the entire front desk staff was to ALL the customers. It was almost comical how consistently put out they were at the slightest question or request. They did assist everyone we saw, but it seemed as though they felt dealing with the public was utterly beneath them. Strange and funny, if not slightly annoying. Oh, and the garage is closed on Sunday's so you can't pull your car out if you need it that day. On that note, don't bring a car to Rome in the first place; it's nothing but a hassle.",
            "The Hotel Cicerone is a first-rate hotel located within walking distance of the Vatican and Castel Sant'Angelo and a number of good restaurants. The hotel serves an excellent breakfast, the rooms are well maintained and the furnishings and bathroom area very clean. The hotel staff is courteous and fluent in two or more languages. We will certainly stay at the Hotel Cicerone during our next visit to Rome.",
            "Stayed at the Cicerone in November for a short break. The hotel is good quality, friendly staff, spotlessly clean and is in a good location, just a short walk over Ponte Umberto to Piazza Navona or across Ponte Cavour to reach the popular shopping areas. The nearest metro stop is Lepanto and is only a short walk to the hotel. Regular buses depart from the front of the hotel or from nearby Piazza Cavour. The hotel room was a good size and very clean with a good size bathroom and daily maid service with linen change. The mini bar prices are very high, we moved the contents around and stored our own items in there. We did have to request more pillows as the single one provided is like a wedge of rock!! The morning breakfast buffet is 'american style' serving dreadful bacon and eggs, but a generous amount of cereal, pastries, bread, cheese and meats. Check out is at 11am, and the latest check out you can have is 12pm and costs you an additional 10 euros, we took advantage of the baggage check facility as our departure wasn't till 5 and this is free. The only downside is the hotel is frequently used for cruise ship guests so there was always a high volume of people and bags in the lobby, and you did get the feeling that you were not as important as they were. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would consider returning again.",
            "Very good hotel in an excellent location - close to everything, but away from hordes of tourists. Nice restaurants in the area. Breakfast could have been better - you might have expected a bit more variety so at the end of day 3 it gets really boring, but quality of food is good and service is perfect.",
            "We stayed at the Cicerone Hotel for 5 nights in September 2007 as part of a Globus tour. The room was large (by European standards) and quiet. The linen was changed every day and was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was very clean but old and \u2018tired\u2019 \u2013 it needed to be renovated. The breakfast room provided a buffet breakfast but the bread was stale, no rolls (only croissants), lids left off the hot food, and often the tablecloths were stained (from earlier diners and they hadn\u2019t been changed). Because this appears to be a hotel for lots of coach tours, it was crowded and the breakfast staff were not very friendly (maybe they were getting to the end of a long summer?). One morning we were up for a 6:30am breakfast because the coach tour for the Vatican Museum left at 7am. The queue for the breakfast room was very long and when we got in, the room was crowded, some of the serving dishes had not been replenished and it was a scramble for what was there. This was meant to be a 4 star hotel but the breakfast was about 2 star. The reception staff were knowledgeable but again appeared to be lacking any genuine friendliness toward the customers. There was a nice bar and restaurant in the hotel but they were quite expensive. Location was good with lots of restaurants nearby and a 15 minute walk to the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus.",
            "My wife and I traveled for 16 days with 3 other couples and our trip ended in Rome. We had prepaid our vacation 6 mos.+ prior to our departure date only to find out that one couple could stay at this hotel and 3 couples were moved to another hotel. The only explanation that we could interpret was there was water damage on the 7th floor. I personally walked through the 7th floor and no construction/repairs were taking place. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NON EXISTENT..FRONT DESK STAFF APPEARED TO BE TOO BUSY AND NOT SHOWING ANY CARE OR CONCERN. Personally I fell they were over booked as many tour groups were operating from this hotel. Also as a final note our room was located on a main street,(front of hotel) which wasvery noisy.",
            "This hotel is located within 15 minutes of the Vatican & St. Peter's, and only about 1 block from a small grocery store. Our room on the 3rd floor was clean and updated, not 1970s style like some reviewers mentioned. Just don't expect the Hilton. It's smaller & simpler, but you're in Rome, so it all evens out. Cereal, fruit, lots of bread/meat/cheese to choose from at breakfast, plus bacon and eggs. The hotel is also about 3 blocks from the subway, super convenient. There's also a great little pizza place right across the street from the hotel, where we went on a rainy night when we didn't want to walk far. The only \"downer\" was the hotel staff behind the front desk, who were rude even to my elderly mother, who has the manners of Queen Elizabeth and the patience of a saint. Oh well, we saw them little enough. Just enjoy Rome and don't expect a friendly hotel staff if you stay here.",
            "It was the first 3 nights me and my wife stayed to this hotel in our 2-week travel in Italy. This 4 star hotel provided us with calm nights which were really good for us. It was not very expensive comparing to other 4 star hotels as the location is not in the right centre of the city. But the nearest metro station is 5min from the hotel. So the location was not really the problem. The best thing of this hotel for us was the amenities. The slippers were especially great. We took them and used them for the rest of the travel. There were not so many choices for dinner around the hotel...",
            "I took my mother to Rome and we stayed at this hotel for four nights. The location was very good and the rooms were decent compared to most European hotels. The front desk staff were snooty, rude, and seemed uncaring most every time we passed them. The great qualities? The wonderful breakfast buffet! AND the wonderful Bar-Staff, these guys made up for all the other shortcomings, they sure know how to treat a customer. I would say that I have already recommended this hotel and I would probably stay here again, in spite of the jerks at the front desk.",
            "The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are small, filthy and had black mold on the vents. I never took my shoes off because the carpet was so nasty. The pictures of the hotel look fantastic but I can promise you they are not accurate. The breakfast is horrible and the staff are very unfriendly and never made eye contact. The room was stuffy and had a bad odor and the air conditioner wasn't working. The only positives I can come up with is, 1) the coffee at breakfast was good, 2) the location was good. 3) the shower was good. Hardly worth it though, I would have rather stayed outside on the sidewalk, it was cleaner than the hotel! !",
            "We found the Cicerone to be an above average hotel. The staff was excellent. We were there over Christmas and had booked a car via the internet. The staff told us we were paying too much and helped us rent a far more reasonable new car. They also were able to find us places to dine on Christmas Eve and Christmas Lunch...both meals in Rome restaurants are traditionally closed. Hotel Restaurant was also open on those days. We would return.",
            "We stayed three nights at the Cicerone hotel and if you are from the US you will notice the differences right away. For one, a double room usually means twin beds, and no two rooms are built to look the same. The room was just average for it being a four star hotel. The staff was slow to respond to issues too. Our safe didn't work and in Italy you must protect your money and your passport. They fixed it the last day we were there, even though we asked them to fix it the first night we arrived. We also had a room on the 8th floor but the elevator stops on the 7th! It was quiet though, so that was nice. You can't beat the location of the hotel though, as it is within walking distance (15 minutes) of the Vatican City. All in all, it was clean, not luxurious but decent. Beds were hard, towels stiff, flat, flat, flat pillows, but they had plenty of hot water and the toilet pressure was good. Oh, and whatever you do buy a blow dryer in Italy, if you need one. Their's worked like a vacuum cleaner nozzle set to low--resembled one too! The free buffet breakfast was good. Although American style scrambled eggs are so much better than Italian scrambled eggs (Yuck! ).",
            "cicerone has a very good location, a twenty minutes walk to the spanish steps (with stroller), it had a very nice breakfast but the service is a little slow but overall a good experience. there are a couple of good italian restaurants around. the hop on hop off tours also have pick up points nearby. there is an underground 5 min away. some members of the staff were really helpfull. overall a good hotel.",
            "I just stayed at the hotel for 1 week. The hotel was in a great location. You could walk everywhere important in Rome. 6ish euro cab ride to the train station for day trips. Rooms were ok. Beds and pillows were awful that was my only real complaint. Bathroom was good shower worked fine. Tvs were bad too trying to catch up on any news from home was impossible. Wifi was a joke 9 euro a day. Staff was really nice. The free breakfast ment well and was ok for a few days but after 1 week it was starting to wear on me. For the price it was a decent deal there are probably better hotels to stay at but all and all not bad.",
            "I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in September 2005. It is a large, well appointed hotel with comfortable, clean rooms. It is superbly located just off the Piazza Cavour and close to some good shopping streets. It's about 20 minutes walk to the Vatican and the Piazza Navona. Staff are worth a mention as they were extremely helpful and polite.",
            "I was part of a group that stayed 3 nights in this hotel in the Prati district of Rome. That is just north of Castle Saint Angelo and the palace of Justice. Our group was over 50 people and they got us situated and our luggage off the bus and into our rooms relatively quick. The front desk was OK, could have been a little more friendly. The lobby bar is nice but like all hotel bars a little expensive. The breakfast was very good and offered more than just rolls and coffee. The location is great if you are mainly interested in the Vatican and St Peters. It's also only a short walk to the Piazza del Popolo. This is a very nice plaza with 3 churches one of which (Santa Maria del Popolo) has 2 Caravagio paintings. The view from the Pincio is spectacular. From there, it's a short walk to the Spanish Steps. The hotel seems to cater to groups as there were several there. It's a larger hotel and groups do require a lot of rooms. I'm not sure of the price because it was included in the trip. If I was on my own, I would opt for a smaller, cheaper hotel as you spend so little time in your room when there is all of Rome to see. If your group has booked here, you will be fine. The rooms facing the street are a little noisey. The air conditioning was fine as it is up and running in June. The controls take a few minutes to figure out. Room safe, nice bath, all the regular stuff. Heard some complaints about the internet availability, but we didn't use it. This hotel is not convenient to the forum or coliseum as they are a taxi ride for sure. All in all, a good stay.",
            "The greatest area if you want to explore Rome.Near to metro station and only 10min walking to Vaticano and his museums.Many good restaurants around but to find them you have to explore the small streets(there aren't restaurants at the main street). The room was very noisy(mine was from the side of the main street)and not so clean. The Breakfast was great and with variety.",
            "I stayed in Hotel Cicerone with my Mum as we were told it was close to the Vatican. The hotel was lovely and clean. The staff at the desk and the bar were a little impersonal, but this did not spoil our thoughts of the hotel. Very busy hotel with people and tours coming in and out all day. The concierge helped us to book a tour to Castel Gandolfo, the Pope's Summer residence to hear his Sunday address. We were very lucky as we got the last two tickets on the bus for the trip. Also the same concierge helped us to find our way around Rome and to locate an open top tour bus. We were on the wrong side of the city for the shops and other amenities, but we still had three good days of touring. Stayed here in September 2010",
            "My husband and my parents stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and our expectations were blown away. The rooms were quite large (queen bed with desk, pull-out couch and enormous bathroom). I believe that if you stay on the 7th floor you will most likely get a balcony which was a real treat! We slept with the patio doors open every night! The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful especially when it came to ensuring we got on our buses for tours and our flights back home. The breakfast was great which offered a variety of meats, yogurts, cheeses, cereal, fresh fruit, juices and more! The location was a highlight as the area was great for shopping, dining and wasn't as congested as across the bridge where several organized school trips must of been staying. Whether you're there for 2 nights or 7 nights, I highly recommend this hotel as you will get your barrings quickly and enjoy the location. We even found a restaurant we went back to several times during our stay called San Marco which was a 3 mins walk from the hotel. Food and service was amazing. The restaurant across the street from the hotel was also very impressive. Too bad we waited until the end of the trip to eat there! There is also a quaint little deli/store down the road where we bought meats and cheeses and wine and water to have for mid-day snacks.",
            "We stayed here a few weeks ago on the advice of our travel agent. Given the mediocre reviews on TA, concern was mounting. As it turns out, things turned out quite different from the negative reviews posted here, First of all, the room and bathroom were very clean, no mold to be seen. Room was cleaned at least once daily. A/C worked well, beds were comfortable. Breakfast buffet was similar to other hotels we stayed at in Italy: heavy on pastries with watered down coffee - ask for a double expresso or 2. Location of hotel is convenient to Vatican area sites as well as sites across the river. We used mass transit to get to Coliseum, Spanish Steps,Trevi and other galleries and churches. Bus is very close by and subway is about a 2 1/2 block walk. Before the trip, I had not planned on using mass transit, but the convenience of it outweighed any negatives. Some subway cars look like the 1970's NYC subways with graffiti covering the entire cars, while others were spotless. Just ask the front desk for the correct bus numbers to take. The subway has maybe 20-30 stops total, so it's almost impossible to get lost. Front desk staff was over-the-top helpful in straightening out some gallery reservations WE had messed up in Florence. They stayed on the line, on hold, for over 20 minutes and resolved our mistakes. Great Job!

            "I chose this hotel as it had a restaurant, room service and a bar. I knew we would reach Rome very late and wanted to be able to get food when we arrived. I was so glad I had done this as we were VERY late (thank you Easy Jet!!). The hotel is lovely, very clean and not in the least noisy. Staff were extremely helpful, the Concierge staff particularly. Breakfast was average only, the hotel restaurant for diiner was lovely, but the best thing was the location, everything was quite close, excellent shopping just around the corner, and a few fab restaurants also very close by. I will be back next year.",
            "Unfortunately, I was one of the 'bus tours' stuck staying in this hotel. At the advice of our travel agent, my husband and I let Carnival Cruise Lines book our hotel post-cruise in Rome. I know for a fact that we paid $300+ euros for this hotel and I regret every penny. Out of all the places we visited in Europe, this was the most expensive and the worst - the rooms lacked decor, the double beds were two twins pushed together and VERY hard, the pillows were like pancakes, the bathrooms were dirty, etc. etc. I didn't find the front staff rude - mabey they've worked on their hospitality. The helped me find the right busline for the Colissieum and gave me directions on how to catch the bus. The hotel is in a good location within walking distance to the Vatican. Our friends on the same cruise booked a hotel on their own - paid $175 euro and had a balcony and a view of a piazza. Their room was beautiful. I kick myself thinking about how much we paid to stay here - but luckily we were only there one night and only slept in the room. Overall, I don't recommend - bad value for the price. Feel free to email me with questions.",
            "We stayed at the Cicerone Hotel 2 nights and the hotel has a very good location. Our stayed was very pleasant until last night, when I realized that somebody had stolen me a pair of shoes. Is insignificant the pair of shoes, but what it is important was the attitude that took the hotel staff . Nobody worried about the matter and only they were capable to tell me was \"we are so sorry\".",
            "Arrived at hotel via private taxi which I had booked on the internet. The taxi driver could not speak any english but the staff at the hotel were very helpful in translating for us. We found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself was comfortable and our room was very spacious and well planned out. We had our first evening meal in the hotel. The menu was limited but the main course steak was excellent although a few vegetables would not have gone amiss. The dessert was excellent. However the breakfast was very poor. Not even toast. As it was advertised as an \"American Breakfast\" we did expect something better. We found the hotel to be in a very good location within easy walking distance of many attractions.",
            "Very dissapointed with this hotel. The heater in the room didn't work and despite 3 calls to reception with promises someone was on the way to look at it no one ever turned up. Likewise we asked for extra blankets because the room was cold twice and never saw them. This hotel is one of the noisiest hotels I have ever stayed in. there is no soundproofing on the doors and every one has to slam the doors to close them - it was like fireworks for hours on end every night with all the banging. Also there were noisy kids running up and down the halls and in the next room - I had to buy ear plugs to sleep at night. Despite 2 requests for a quieter room, I was told they were fully booked and it was not possible to change rooms. Be warned - stay well away from this hotel.",
            "We booked this hotel pre cruise and it seemed good value for money to us. We travelled on 21/11 so maybe the hotel was a bit less busy. Must thank the earlier reviewer ( Holly i think) who recommended the nearby restaurant Al Palazzaccio. We ate there both nights of our stay- Could get a good meal with good quality house wine for a really reasonable price for Rome. Room- was clean, with wooden floors, toiletries and reasonably quiet ( as we had requested) being at the side of the building. Location- it was a pleasant 15minute walk to St Peters Square and the vatican musuem Breakfast- was fine for this standard hotel, got our tea/coffee within a couple of minutes of ordering both days. Reception- found them professional but not involved- would not have been confident of their interest if we found ourselves in any difficulties . All in all we'd never been to Rome before and felt we could have done much worse.",
            "We purchased a package from our cruise for the day after in Rome. From the internet information, the Cicerone Hotel looked very nice and we agreed to pay the large fee for the six of us to stay there for one night. The location is very good. You are near the Vatican and can walk to the northern tourist spots easily. The property is run down. The rooms are shabby, The bed was very uncomfortable. I asked about getting a cup of hot water for tea and was told that it was not possible! For what we paid to stay here, we did not recieve good value for our money.",
            "From the television stations, including the constant USA bashing Russia Today, (among others) to the completely rude staff do not expect to be treated decently if you are American. This hotel and staff were equally pathetic and an affront to ones senses. I mean that literally. Be sure to bring along some extra deodorant to hand out to the staff. I think the reason the hotel is called a 4 star hotel is because the sign above the entrance has 4 stars next to the name. The $500 per night room was small, shabby and had a great view of the back of some nondescript building where you could hear and see trash being removed daily. The breakfast buffet actually had POWDERED EGGS (when was the last time you had powdered eggs at a $500 a night hotel) and to get the waitsaff to help in any way was a lost cause. The hotel lobby staff was equally as bad. It was a major effort just to get them to recognize we were in front of them asking questions that needed to be answered. Location was not great but is the only possible reason not to give the hotel a zero rating. We have been to many countries before and have never been treated this poorly. This truly was Euro Trash at its best.",
            "Just returned from 10 nights at this hotel. 3rd time we stayed here. We love the location and the hotel. Never had a bad room--always clean, roomy and quiet. We request an inside-facing room. Many reviews indicate the front desk staff is rude. I don't agree with that -- my opinion, just \"Italian-style\" -- not American-style phony. They are all characters. Ask the \"cashier\" for change? Ha - no change available. Each person has his/her own job, so you can go from one to another. I found this more fun and Italian-style charming. Go with the flow... you are in ROME not Indianapolis! Hotel DOES have alot of tours coming and going, but we were on our own and were not around when they came and went, so they did not bother us. This is a medium size hotel, not a mega resort. There is a small bar/lounge area off the lobby. They try an American-style breakfast with scrambled eggs and bacon...pretty good. Also European-style cheeses and luncheon meats as well as breads, yogurt, cereal, fruit, juices and cappuccino. You can't go away hungry unless you want to. Two good trattorias I would recommend. One just across the street, Grotta Azzurra, has great steaks, pasta and THE BEST Pizza Margherita...try it. Around the corner is our favorite, al Palazzaccio. Great Roman lamb, veal & ravioli with walnut cream sauce. Wine great, also. Waiters - very entertaining - Marcianno speaks some English, loves women and is actually shy. We had the best time staying here and would recommend it to anyone who is open to real Roman people.",
            "When in Rome, this is NOT the place to stay. Although rated as a four star hotel, we found it lacked even the class and charm of a normal three star lodging. The beds were the most uncomfortable we have ever slept in--anywhere. Service was not good and the front desk never answered the phone. None of the hotel departments would pick up calls making it difficult to get any information, room service etc. This is a large property that caters to tour groups which may explain the tepid coffee at breakfast and the lack of genuine customer service. We spent over $500 per night USD for two rooms and did not feel this property was worth half the price. Avoid this.",
            "I stayed here as part of a group, and this hotel seems to handle many groups. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. This is located in an area with many good and small restaurants, and an excellent gelato shop 2 blocks away. Those with rooms on the main street complained of noise, but I was fine- expecting noise in a big city. Breakfast offerings were plentiful and varied, and wait staff will bring you espresso or capuchinno if you don't want the cafe american. I was shocked at the prices in the hotel bar: a shot of limoncello was 6 euro, and a simple gin and tonic was 12 euro! Drink at dinner, not the bar!",
            "We stayed at the Cicerone for five nights in August while on our honeymoon to Italy. I anticipated a true four star hotel due to the positive reviews I read prior to booking this hotel. However, we discovered that this hotel was more like a 2 1/2 star. Here is my quick list of pros and cons: Pros: great central location, walking distance to the Metro, the Vatican, and fun night spots such Campo de Fiori. Cons: Rude staff, charge you for double occupancy (in my case 30 euros additional per day) even after you have paid for the hotel via yoru travel provider (in my case orbitz), rooms are extremely tiny even for European standards, rooms feel stale and their bedding feels filthy, and to top it off they don't even give you an iron - instead they charge you 5 euros to iron a single shirt",
            "While the location of the Cicerone is excellent, in particular for those with a special interest in St Peter's and the Vatican, and while rooms are adequate, we (my wife, adult son and I) were disappointed by a number of things. The hotel seems to be aimed mostly at large groups, and is overall in need of some freshening up. The busy staff at reception were reasonably efficient but not very friendly or welcoming. The television in our room was malfunctioning, and an extinguished lighbulb in my bedside lamp was not replaced over the three days of our stay. The toilet seat in our ensuite was cracked, and there was dirt around the airconditioning unit. A slightly musty cigarette aroma lingered. Worst was the appalling breakfast: bread and cakes were stale, fruit was tinned, eggs and milk watery. We would also recommend against the Grotta Azzurra restaurant across the road: the food is cheap but the service uncharacteristically poor (we were brought the wrong dishes in the wrong order).",
            "I have just returned from a seven night stay at this hotel. It was one of the most enjoyable holidays I have ever had. This was the first time travelling on my own and the staff at the Cicerone were extremely friendly and helpful. Arranging tours and transfer to the airport was no problem to the desk staff - I never found them to be rude - always pleasant and welcoming. The room was very clean and the service in the restaurant was first rate. The hotel is close to the Vatican and Pantheon. If walking is a problem, taxis can be found in the Piazza Cavour near to the Hotel - most fares were between 5 and 10 euros. I would definitely stay here again! !",
            "This is a 4 star hotel on the North Side of the river, about 10 minutes walk from Vatican City We paid 310\u20ac for 3 nights (for 2 people) incl breakfast and we couldnt really fault the value. Hotel was lively with Amercian Tourists getting of the buses day and night. Rome City is 20 minutes walk across the river, and Ancient Rome is a pleasant 35 minutes walk. A good location for all of Rome. Number 70 bus takes you from outside the hotel to the train station, (1\u20ac) and a train takes you the Leonardo Da Vinci airport in 25 mins (11\u20ac). However when we landed we opted to get a shuttle to the airport , this can end up touring the city before dropping you off, but we were lucky and were first (18\u20ac each) taxis were quoting 50 - 75\u20ac Breakfasts were typcial continental but good. Hard for me to find any faults",
            "We stayed at Cicerone hotel for three nights April 2012. The staff was helpful and fast, room was quiet, clean and normal size, bathroom was also big. The location is great, Vatican and St Peter are very near. First we thought that we would be far away from the popular \"piazzas\", which are located at the other side of the river but we walked even down to Colosseum very easy. There are many interesting shops at the nearby Cola di Rienzo and every day we visited restaurants around with the highest ranking in tripadvisor and we did not regret even one time. For its money I think it is a honest proposal.",
            "It was a more modern hotel, but it was obvious that they had not refurbished the rooms and bathrooms since they opened it. The tub did not drain properly and the position of the shower head caused water to leak on the floor. The breakfast was great and the staff were easy to work with.",
            "Make friends with the bartenders, they will treat you right. That was the best part of my stay. Lots of tour groups and cruise goers stay here. Hotel was pretty outdated by American standards. Not much charm either. The concierge was helpful at times but others seemed bothered. What I did like about the neighborhood surrounding the hotel was it was not as touristy as some parts of Rome.",
            "Stayed here with husband and friends recently and arrived early for check in, 11am to be exact. No trouble, we were allocated our rooms immediately and able to go out to immerse ourselves in the beauty and culture that is Rome. Staff were most helpfull and the attention to each request and question was efficient and most helpful. Breakfast was good too and our rooms were most comfortable.",
            "Cannot complain about this hotel at all. The location was great. Walking distance to Castel Sant'Angelo and half hour to The Vatican. It might sound long but with views you get in Rome, I didn't complain. The nearest train station to the hotel is Lepanto which is also around a 5 minute walk. The area also has a few restaurants and of course gelati shops. The staff at the hotel were courteous and friendly. The hotel has a nice foyer and on the left hand side there is a bar. The bedrooms were spacious. Could hardly fault it really. A reasonable sized bathroom and was clean. The beds were comfortable and clean, television had English speaking channels. The breakfast was pretty good as well. A variety of food including cereal, croissants, fruit, yoghurt etc. I really cannot say anything bad about it because there was nothing to complain about. If I was going back to Rome I would definitely go back there again.",
            "Stayed at this hotel from Christmas Day to New Year's Day. Breakfast buffet good - cereals, fruit, juices, bread, eggs and meat. Location great - we walked to all of the sites - the Vatican, Colosseum, Forum, ST Peters, etc. Hotel room a bit noisy on street side of building. No free wifi was a bother but available for 7 euros/24 hours. Staff most helpful. Lunch one day in the hotel restaurant was great - salads, shellfish. We'd stay again simply because of the location.",
            "Great location. Close to metro and in a very nice, quiet neighborhood. You can walk to various sites. The hotel staff was very helpful in every way. They anticipated our needs (giving us info that we hadn't even asked for yet) and helped with some personal phone calls by speaking Italian for us. Nice. It was hot and the room had great air conditioning (very cool). Breakfast was very nice. This hotel and another we experienced this summer can't seem to get the bread and rolls right but otherwise highly recommended.",
            "Just got back from Rome! We stayed for 3 nights at Hotel Cicerone with my wife. I was a bit worried before our trip, after reading so many negative comments about Cicerone. Fortunately we founded those comments false. Room was old, but clean. Unfortunately pillows are flat and hard, but we managed to sleep well enough. Breakfast was nice, but bacon lacks salt. Staff is as friendly as everyone in Rome, if you know what I mean. Location is very good. Traffic is not too loud eventhough there is only single glass windows. Compared to Finnish hotels Cicerone is rather 3 stars than 4, but still ok place to stay.",
            "This hotel is large and rooms are nice, aircon a plus. 6 euros to iron a shirt (no irons) was a bit much! There are lots of americans staying at the hotel so english people to chat to. The main restaurant was nice, its 30 euros for 3 course set menu, 20 euros per bottle of wine. We walked to all the sites and back (good to walk off the food!) Things to be aware of in Rome: If you SIT down at a cafe or gelateria, you pay 6 euros JUST to sit down and up to 4 euros service charge on yoru bill (for ice-cream thats a JOKE) We sat down at one place that wanted to charge us 40 euros for 2 diet cokes, 1 water, 2 ice creams (with the service and seating charges), thats insane Gypsies - there are a lot of Romanian gypsies in Rome, KEEP your bags out of site and closed! I had someone stop a guy from taking my camera and my husbands cell phone was stolen!!! Overall Rome has amazing history so the sites are breathtaking, just do your research for restaurants FIRST so you know where you are eating so you dont get ripped off, it can be EXPENSIVE! Venice was cheaper than Rome!",
            "We stayed at this hotel last weekend for my Dad's 60th birthday celebrations. There were 9 in our party including my 8 year old daughter. Our room ( triple) was reasonably spacious but absolutely nothing like the rooms represented on the website - they were very basic a certainly not 4 star. My parents booked the superior double- on arrival were told there was no double and they would need a twin,the room was more basic than ours, very small and the air con blew out hot air and would not turn off, leaving their room like an oven! They were eventually moved the second day after being told several times that their room was indeed a superior although clearley it wasn't.The pillows were so thin and we only had one each- when we requested extra we were told there weren't any, along with no hairdryer or iron. Breakfast was good but very basic and we had to go elsewhere on the first morning as the queue was up two flights of stairs! Overall I was very dissapointed with the hotel. My parents paid almost \u00a32000 for this accommodation and I would not reccommend it to anyone....they seem more interested on how many people they can squeeze in rather than offering good service",
            "I was pretty worried about this hotel from skimming the reviews here, but it was perfectly OK, even a bit better than OK. It is clearly a big group tour hotel, and we were there through a booking agency, but not as part of a tour. Our rooms (a double and a triple) were clean and comfortable. Not luxurious, but not Motel 6 quality either by a long shot. The bathroom was clean and the facilities all worked well. I especially liked the bright bedside lights. After a week touring Italy where the reading lights were so dim it was hard to read, I appreciated the light by the bed. The wireless internet is grossly overpriced at 17 euro for 24 hours, but at least it worked well for us, with no problems mentioned by another reviewer. The breakfast was plentiful and varied, but not terribly exciting. Very typical of Italian hotel breakfast buffets. The espresso was much better than the watered down coffee, just ask for it. The croissants were sweet and bready (why is it impossible to find a crisp croissant in all of Italy? ), and the eggs were reasonable, for hotel scrambled steamtable eggs. However, the very best, and I mean BEST thing about the Cicerone Hotel is that it is around the corner from Al Palazzaccio, a trattoria with really good food, pleasant staff, not expensive, just really tasty. We had some of our best simple meals there. There's a reason that it fills up as soon as it opens. Go at 7 PM, get seated immediately and get 15% off your bill (their \"happy dinner time\"), or wait until 7:30 and wait an hour for a table. Just go! Via Ennio Quirino Visconti 66-68.",
            "We were on a tour as were most of the hotel guests which made the lines at the breakfast buffett terrible on most of the days we were there. The breakfast is only fair and often ran out of food. The rooms were small, tired and worn. The hotel stafff was marginally helpful. The hotel was in a good location for walking to many sites.",
            "Just back from Rome stayed in the Cicerone I can't say enough about this hotel or it's staff.Was a bit apprehensive before I went after reading some of the reviews,but what a pleasant surprise,the room was spotlessly clean,and it was cleaned everyday with a change of both towels and linen daily.We had a room at the front and we were not kept awake any night also it was warm and comfortable and we had plenty of natural light through the large window.The staff could not be more helpful or pleasant.Will definitely stay there again if we return to Rome.",
            "My wife and I spent two nights at the Hotel Cicerone following a cruise to the Greek Isles. We booked through Celebrity cruise, choosing the Cicerone primarily for its location. We were about a 10-15 minute walk from the Piazza Navona and all the restaurants in the area. We were also able to walk to the Vatican, the Castel Sant Angelo, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and other sites. We took a bus to ancient Rome. The hotel was acceptable for our visit. The included breakfast was OK - we stuck with granola and pastries. The eggs and breakfast meats looked a little dubious. The room was very small, but OK for two nights. Be prepared to pay a lot more in Rome for much less than you would in the States.",
            "jusy got back from a weeks stay at this hotel and i do not rate it as 4 star.it needs a refit our room 607 had a very dirty carpet with a lot of stains on it, there was also a big stain on the ceiling and the wallpaper was marked and dirty.the staff were very friendly and helpful the buffet breakfast was ok but boring and they could not make tea or coffee with hot water. i would not stay here again. rod from cornwall",
            "We arrived at 3pm and our room was ready and nice and air conditioned ( it was 34 degrees celcius out ) so we were ready for a shower and a quick rest! The front desk was very helpful and a nice young man carried our bags up for us. The breakfast the next morning was delicious. Hot coffee and milk at your table in an instant,or cappicino made up for you on order! There was plenty of hot food to go around plus fruit and cereal. We stayed for 3 nights and it was a 15 minute walk to the Vatican and close to many other attractions.There is a decent grocery store 2 blocks away as well as other stores that run for about 2 blocks. We would stay here again!",
            "My daughter and I spent 3 nights at the Cicerone Hotel while joining a tour group in Rome. We found the hotel nicely located for us, we don't mind walking. We were with in walking distance to most of the sights that we wanted to see. The hotel rooms were good sized for a large city. No air conditioning yet, which was a bit uncomfortable for us as we are from Maine. We couldn't leave the windows open at night as we were right above the a busy street and it was fairly noisey. My only complaint was that there was black mold growing in the bathroom tub/shower, other than that, we found the room very clean. We should have asked for more pillows as ours were very flat.",
            "It was our first time in Rome and we didn't know what to expect from a hotel there. The Cicerone was excellent--clean and modern. We had a comfortable room with a king sized bed and a nice sized and very clean bathroom. The hotel price included a full \"all you can eat\" buffet breakfast with American-style coffee!!!! Best of all is the hotel's location. It is within easy walking distance to the Vatican and the great shops and restaurants by the Spanish Steps. We also walked to the Colliseum and other City sites. We highly recommend the Cicerone if you are traveling to Rome. Don't forget to try the cappocinos!",
            "Spent 3 nights at the Cicerone pre-cruise (Carnival) from Civitavecchia. This was our second visit to Rome, and I found the Cicerone superior to all other hotels I've stayed at in Italy. Location is terrific - walkable to Vatican City, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain and great shopping just a few blocks away. Bedroom adequate & we got our requested king-size bed, large bathroom and shower, all clean & neat. Renovations still going on based on appearance of hallway on our floor, but I guess we got lucky--no construction noise. Front desk staff could be friendlier but no complaints with breakfast room or bar staff. Buy a drink at the bar and afternoon/early evening snacks are provided - including their *wonderful* marinated olives. Adequate selection & quality in breakfast room. \"Security issues\" noted by other travelers re door-knob with room key attached I've found is still pretty routine in Europe. With number of people coming & going at the front desk though, I got the feeling anyone could walk up and ask for any key in a box and get it. Regardless, I would definitely use this property again.",
            "We found the front of house staff 'aloof bordering on rude and arrogant. The breakfast were nothing to get excited about, the wait staff in the dining room seemed to be under great pressure, at one breakfast we did not recieve tea or coffee even after asking staff several times. Our first night there was a party going on in the downstairs bar with loud music which could be heard in our 1st floor room quite clearly. we would not recommened this hotel to our frends.",
            "I stayed at the Cicerone for three nights recently. The room was adequate, but could have been much cleaner. I don't know when the carpet was last cleaned, and remnants of it clung to my slippers. The bathroom was large and seemed cleaner than the room. The breakfast was awful, with some of the worst coffee I have ever had. I did order the espresso after tasting the coffee, and that was fine. The waitstaff at breakfast were very nice, but the front desk staff were very rude. If they don't want to be in a service position they should go elsewhere. There were several tours at the hotel while I was there, but that was no excuse for the rudeness of the staff.",
            "The Cicerone is in Prati, an area Romans do there shoppin in. It is also near to the Vatican and one can easily walk to the historic centre in 15-20 minutes. It does not rate highly on charm, having a 1980s look to it. Our rooms were baking hot and, despite repeated requests to reception staff, it was impossible to have the heating switched off. It seems that Roman hotels, like Roman apartment buildings, have set dates for switching heating on and off. Opening the French windows to the terrace was only an option when one was not in the room as every bus in the city seems to roar its way along Via Cicerone. Note: colleages with rooms not on the street side could open windows without having problems of noise. Breakfast was uninteresting. The hotel seems to be popular with Japanese package tourists.",
            "We spent a week at the hotel. Nice sized room, clean and confortable. The breakfast buffet was good. The hotel is located in a very nice area to be in. Easy walk to major attractions and good local neighbourhood resturants. Disposable plastic cups, no wine glasses in the room don't allow this to turly be a 4 star hotel, but it is still superior to many others. We had some problems with the tour company that booked us and the hotel worked to get everything cleared up and in order. Great staff that speak english.",
            "We stayed in this hotel at the end of our family vacation. We had actually booked accommodations elsewhere which we walked into and immediately started looking for something else. The Cicerone is what we found. It is comfortable and well maintained. It is certainly not the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in (I didn't walk around without slippers in the room) and I will probably never return. The front desk staff was somewhat helpful, but nobody put themselves out for us. It is close to the Vatican but since most tourist sites are on the other side of the Tiber River, each taxi ride was more expensive than it might otherwise have been. A less hectic and harried search would probably have located a hotel that better fit our needs.",
            "This hotel is decent. Location is OK, not too much around it, but not as bad as some desolate locations. Overall cleanliness and service of hotel is good. You must remember European hotels are not like American hotels, with the luxuries of a strong a/c and centered locations, but I did enjoy my stay. Just being in Italy makes it worthwhile.",
            "Having read the past reviews (on this site) I was a little anxious about staying in this hotel. I am glad I did though as it was lovely! Perhaps I was lucky but my bed was quite comfortable and I got round the \"not so plump\" pillows by asking for 2 of them. I found the front of house to be all very friendly and helpful, perhaps they were responding to my cherry disposition. Ironically the only thing I wasn't that crazy about was breakfast. I thought that it could have been of a higher standard but I did manage to stuff myself every morning before hitting the sights... I would stay there again and I would recommend it to my friends.",
            "We loved the location, close to the Vatican and St Peter's but furniture and linens were quite worn and we had a view of a concrete wall.. It is pricey for the quality of the room. The breakfast choices were good. We stayed here for three days and then moved to the Dei Mellini for the last three days and liked that property much better.",
            "We have stayed at the Cicerone Hotel on 4 occasions. The staff never seem to change. They are really helpful and the position of the hotel is great. Many of the rooms have been upgraded and it is a very comfortable room, certainly not delux but very adequate. The neighbourhood is really safe to walk through in the evening. The hotel is used by many cruise companies for pre or post Rome stays. The hotel can also organise a taxi down to Civitavechia before or after the cruise and the prices you get from the hotel is actually much cheaper than if you organise privately. Breakfasts are great and their is always more than enough to have. Will always use this hotel while in Rome",
            "We stayed there for one night to be near the Vatican....and found ourselves in a rather dismal room that was tired and equivalent of a tired Comfort Inn. It was clean and functional. The bed and pillows were hard, but we have found that to be the case in the two hotels that we stayed in Rome. There is nothing right around the hotel, but it is certainly not a bad walk to the Vatican, to Piazza Novanna/Pantheon...a very pleasant walk actually.. The breakfast food was plentiful but not appetizing at all...the orange juice was strange!! If you are looking for a serviceable place to stay, then it would be ok....but don't get your hopes up about staying somewhere nice...and with the price of the room, you would expect much nicer!! elitha 10/21/09",
            "This location was great! It is close to the Vatican as well as the Spanish Steps and Piazza Navone and the famous Fontana det Trevi. The American breakfast buffet was OK, but it was same thing everyday. I expected some variety from 4star hotel . They don't change the sheets for a whole week we stayd there. The staff were very professional but I missed the friendliness except Giuliana she was very friendly and answered with a smile. For Swidish Tourist! !one of the Staff with name \"Rosita\" is from Sweden take advantage of that oppurtunity if you have probelm with english, she is very nice. Tips!! !If you want to go to the beach then I would recommend you to take the train the red line towards Termini then ask for il Trenino towards Ostia di Lido. The best beach is on Stella Polare. there are very nice places but it will cost you between 8-10 EUR for Entry + sunbed and Umbrella . or do as we did take the free beach you dont need to pay anything for Entry. we paid \u00a85 EUR only for sun chair with little Umbrella mounted on the sun bed \"two in one\". Ask the livewatcher at the beach he is the one who rent them. it will take about 35 minutes to reach the station Stella Polare with the train. and it is very cheap and save to take train in Rome.",
            "This modern hotel is located close to the Vatican and also to Via Cola de Rienza one of the best shopping area of Rome. It is within walking distance of the Vatican, the shopping district, Piazza di Populo, and Castel San Angelo. While the area appears more residential access to sites and tourist areas is easy. There are trattorias and small shops nearby also for pizza or a dinner on your own.",
            "This was the second time that me and wife stayed at the Cicerone, and we are ready to return as often as we land in Rome. The location is superb, specially because it's very close to major atractions in town but still secluded in a very residential area, not too turisty and off the beaten track, but if you want trendy restaurants and boutiques, everything stands at a stone throw. The rooms are confortable, clean and confortable. The beds are confy and bathrooms toileteries surprisingly nice. The staff tends to be very busy, but try a little italian and they will open their hearts!! !",
            "The reason we stayed at this hotel, booked with Insights Tours. Stayed there Sept 10,11, 2006. Rooms were nice. Not alot of restaurants in the hotel's area. \"Beware\" checking out on the morning of Sept 13th, they wanted to charge us for two breakfast's of 31.00E that was included with our trip. Finally they said forget it.",
            "I know the \"star\" ratings are different in Europe from the U.S., but this was like a bad Motel 6. Even when we complained about the filth (see mold in showers, carpets not vacumed, etc) and where upgraded it was bad. The only redeeming feature of this hotel is that it is well-located.",
            "Our family of 4 bked through globus/monogram so it was an all inclusive packge on what rated as high superior . The facility was extremely clean and cared for daily. The bedrms were small but the beds were somewhat soft enough, the amenities in the bthrm was sufficient. The breakfast although on the expensive side was worth it specially if on the move the whole day and the next real meal is early afternoon. There is a wonderful lobby with a bar on one end and a talented piano player (on a grand piano) that couples enjoy, relax at the end of the day and get to do a little dancing. The vatican is a short 7 minutes away passing through the just building and the angel bridge. Beware though passing through the small plaza when alone at night. It is not well lighted and that plaza seems to be a gathering place for odd groups.",
            "Having trawled the web for a nice hotel and failed through the sheer volume of hotels we decided to book through our local travel agent who recommended the Cicerone Hotel. We were not disappointed! The hotel was easily accessible to most of the sights - the nearest being The Vatican. The rooms were a reasonable size and more importantly, spotlessly clean and well appointed. We enjoyed a fabulous meal in the hotel's restaurant which was a little expensive but well worth it . Considering the long walk around the city taking in the beautiful sights, the last thing you want to do is go out to find a restaurant to eat. Diane from Doncaster",
            "Spent two nights this week with my teenaged daughter. The room was OK - small, not fancy. Didn't feel like a 4 star hotel. Breakfast was mediocre at best. Staff was rude and unfriendly, not attentive to our needs, would not supply an adaptor, did not send promised technician to repair hair dryer. But the location was good - easy walk to the Vatican, shopping, good restaurants and gelato. Good Chinese food around the corner. Rome is HOT in the summer!! After being in London and Paris, we were happy with the cheaper prices in Rome.",
            "We found the Cicerone to be clean with a cheerful staff. Our room was spotless and comfortable. The breakfast was good and plentiful. The location was in walking distance (for us) to alot of the attractions, very centrally located. We would certainly stay there again.",
            "We have been guests at the Cicerone Hotel in Rome 5 times. What keeps us coming back? Location, cleanliness and the best Bar Staff in Rome. Marco Tozzetti is not only a great bartender but he is very helpful on things to do and see in Rome. Gianni, Ilaria and Dominico also can not do enough for you. We stopped by the bar boeth before and after dinner to enjoy their company; talk about what we had done during the day and get ideas for our next day. Can't wait to go back. When in Rome, if you don't stay at the Cicerone be sure to stop in and enjoy a drink with them."

            "We really enjoyed our stay at the Erwin. We went there after ready really good ratings on TA ans we were not disapointed - the service is good and the room as well - thoroughly cleaned and the breakfast at the bar is delicious - would definitly recommend (if you are looking for a laid back good hotel - if you are looking for top of the range 5*, go somewhere else)",
            "So I had a going away party here for my girlfriend and she LOVED this place. The rooftop bar is without compare in Venice or in Santa Monica. We had a great oceanfront room and woke up to the relative calm of Venice Beach before the tourists and shopkeepers showed up. Venice isn't for everyone but it makes for a fun staycation and the Hotel Erwin delivers. We had a great breakfast at Hash too! Would highly recommend.",
            "Several months ago, a friend of ours passed away. My wife and I ventured out to LA for his funeral and had no idea where to stay. A friend of ours recommended this hotel as it was less than 20 minutes to the funeral home. We were exhausted as we arrived late after a five hour drive from Las Vegas. Upon checking in, the front desk agent greeted us with a smile and wished us well on our visit. We were very pleased with the size of our room and our view of the ocean. Upon awakening we ate at the hotel cafe and really enjoyed our breakfast. We then walked down to the beach, which is a very short walk, to try and clear our heads and relax. We couldn't have been more pleased with our experience. I highly recommend this hotel. Thank you Hotel Erwin for helping to create a nice experience during a very sad time in our lives.",
            "This is a great place for a young couple or singles although very pricey. The room we had was lovely but the hotel was very loud (there is a bar on the roof). The elevators were slow and always packed with people. I stayed here with 2 teens and the location was great. Just a block off the boardwalk and close enough.to Marina Del Rey and Santa Monica to walk to (if you like long walks!). The staff was grear and responsive.",
            "Outstanding! From the moment that we walked into the hotel we were greeted by the friendly and extremely accommodating staff. Every employee we encountered was fantastic. Loved the restaurant Hash and the rooftop lounge HIGH has the most amazing views of the ocean and the city. The hotel is close to so much. We were able to walk to the beach, Abbott Kinney, Main Street, Santa Monica Pier, Marina Del Rey. There were shops and restaurants galore all around us. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and next time I\u2019m in Venice you can bet that I will be staying at Hotel Erwin!",
            "I stayed at this hotel with friends at the end of my travels. It was a great hotel. Admittedly the view if you looked down into the alley did not amount to much, but the view of Venice Beach was great. The room was get clean. The rooftop bar has to make the hotel perfect. We happily sat and watched the world go bar. It had great music abd excellent staff. The staff were very helpful throughout, offering us sone great restaurant recommendations. I would definitely advise asking them. We were also walking distance to the canals which are a stunning walk. A great place to stay in the middle of Venice Beach!",
            "Anticipating my first visit and overnighter to Venice Beach we chose this hotel for four adults sharing a two queen room. Prepare to experience an eclectic crowd outside the hotel. I highly recommend that you exit the hotel on foot only by day, it can be a questionable crowd at night considering there is a hostel nearby and many homeless surround the area. The hotel staff was friendly and the room was well kept. When we requested additional towels, a quick friendly response was offered. The restaurant is another story, I could not comment on the food as we seated ourselves and left after waiting 20 minutes and retrieving the menu independently after one was not offerred. Very disappointing.",
            "Stayed here for the first three nights of our two week road trip in August 2011. The hotel is located right on Venice Beach, which although I'm a fan of, it might be considered a little rough around the edges for some. Regardless you can't argue with the location, as it's right next to the beach and promenade. You are able to get beach towels for free from reception. It's worth exploring the area away from the beach such as the shops on Abbot Kinney or the Venice canals which shows there is a lot more to the area then you would first imagine. The hotel itself is modern and our room was much larger than I expected with views over the ocean as well as inland. There's free wifi and HD content on the TV's which is nice. Parking's not cheap at the hotel but it is pretty easy to park in the area if you're willing to walk for a few minutes. Just be mindful of the parking restrictions which fall on different days based on when they're cleaning the street. There's a trendy rooftop hotel bar which was really nice with some great views, as you'd imagine. The only downside is that it seemed to be a destination in itself with complete with an achingly hip crowd and door control. At times we did feel like outsiders in our own hotel. All in all, if you're planning to stay in Venice then this is definitely recommended.",
            "The only good thing about this hotel ws the friendly staff. The worst thing about the hotel were the bathroom doors. They had sliding doors which don't shut all the way so others in the room can easily see into the toilet/shower area of the bathroom. So if you like your privacy...stay away from this hotel. The t.v in my room would turn on by itself at 6:30AM every morning...we mentioned this to the front desk and the \"engineer\" said he would take a look at it but it was never resolved. Woke us up every morning and no one could explain why. My mom and sisters stayed at the suite and complained about the uncomfortable sofa bed because they could feel the springs. We stayed there for 5 nights and every single day we dreaded going back to our hotel. Like I said, the staff was nice but I would NEVER return to this hotel!",
            "While it was only a one night stay, we were thoroughly impressed with this little jewel in Venice Beach. The hotel was clean, the AC was cold, the view of the boardwalk and ocean from the small outdoor space was fantastic. As soon as we checked in we immediately felt a part of the Venice beach scene. There is a rooftop lounge called \u201cHigh\u201d that really picks up at night, but is also the best spot to watch the sunset from. You can get a reservation from through UrbanSpoon.com or calling them direct at (424) 214-1062. The Hotel Erwin is just steps from some great \u201csmall plate\u201d locally sourced food in addition to its own small restaurant. Room service for breakfast was extremely fast, accurate and tasty. Eat out on your patio and watch Venice Beach wake up!",
            "If you haven't been to Venice Beach, don't expect Santa Monica! The neighborhood is funky, not real clean and at night a little scary. But beyond that, Venice Beach is a lot of fun and this hotel was great! We arrived in the late afternoon and after checking in went right up to the rooftop bar to watch the sunset. It was freezing cold, but there were heaters and blankets - plus great drinks, friendly service and a wonderful view - although the sunset the night we were there was not too exciting. We survived the cold for one drink and a panini, but even so, this is a great place to enjoy the ocean view. Our hotel room was small, but newly decorated, very stylish and comfortable. There is a restaurant on-site that we didn't go to - we were only there one night and decided to eat in our room for dinner and then went walking along the beach towards Santa Monica in the morning and found a breakfast spot on our way back. Our room was on the side of the hotel with a decent view over the adjacent buildings to the beach. We might go more upscale on our next visit to LA and try Santa Monica - but would also consider coming back here as the location was good and that rooftop bar is calling to us......",
            "I recently stayed at the Hotel Erwin in Venice Beach California visiting a relative who had just had a baby. The GM upgraded me to a suite to honor the occasion and I must say that the combination of proximity to the beach and central Venice, the price, the decor and the friendliness of the staff make this one of the best all-around hotel experiences I have ever had. The rooftop bar HIGH was the icing on the cake. BEST views and drinks in the area and there is seriously no better place to watch the sun sink into the Pacific than there. I will be back!",
            "I loved this hotel. The service was excellent. The bed was really comfortable and I didn't hear too much from other patrons. The food and service at the restaurant was awesome. After 1 meal there I decided to have all my breakfasts and dinners there.",
            "The hotel wasn't very full and I know why, lots of construction. There was construction going on all throughout the building. My room was nice and the hotel itself seemed to be in a cool location right in Venice Beach, but the construction was hard to overlook. For the price I paid it underwhelmed ($350 for 1 night). I had a few drinks in the bar/restaurant and met a cute bartender, so that was a plus. I checked out the rooftop lounge, which had great sunset views, but I couldn't get any of the servers to even ask me for a drink order. All in all, I probably wouldn't stay here again.",
            "Great place to stay in Venice. 2 minutes to the beach, very clean and comfortable rooms. The decor is very funky and very Venice. The hotel is short walk (5-10 mins) to Abbott Kinney (the main drag in Venice with lots of cute shops and restaurants). The hotel is also about a 2 mile walk to the Santa Monica Pier (very doable- just wear sneakers!). The staff was great, very easy going, but attentive. They have parking available (valet only- $28 a day) which is very nice. If you don't mind walking a few minutes away, you can park your car on the street for free, just go down Market St. or any street near Abbott Kinney and check the parking signs, it is not tough to find! The hotel roof bar is amazing, the views are literally breathtaking! Try and stop up early evening, it gets a little trendy, so dress accordingly! Overall I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the Santa Monica/Venice area.",
            "We stayed here last summer on a whim, and loved it. We decided to bring our friends here this time, and booked on tablethotels.com, as the resort I work at uses tablet, and it is a great website. We stayed in a suite with a pull out and a fireplace, it was roomy and the decor was to our liking. The package that I booked came with a $50 credit at the restaurant. Upon check in I asked what the deal was on that, and the gentleman who helped me was unsure, and there was no record of this on our reservation, but after asking his colleague they came to the conclusion that we would eat there, and then the $50 would be taken off of our bill at check in, and there was no reason to let the restaurant know. When it came time to check out the person that was checking us out said that we should have let the restaurant know when eating about this, although we had been told differently at check in. I explained to him the situation, and then checked out. The bill that he gave me was $100 over what we had agreed to pay on tablethotels.com. When I asked the gentleman why this was, he said I would need to provide proof of our rate. I used their computer to print off the receipt from tablethotels.com which clearly had the rate at $100 less what they were charging. After about 10 minutes of debate, and me having to get a little upset, they realized that they were in the wrong, and fixed the problem. As I have worked with tablethotels.com personally before, I don't understand why they didn't have the correct rate or any information about the voucher in their records. It was frustrating at the time, but overall they corrected their wrongs, and because of the location and the rooms decor, I would definitely stay here again. I just hope that next time there is no issue with the billing.",
            "This was my second stay at the Erwin. I appreciate the location and the security in the hotel. It is at the end of the Venice strip so a quiet location at night. I love the rooftop bar/restaurant to watch the sunsets over the ocean. Rooms are OK and bathroom has little privacy with a sliding glass door, but overall a good value for Venice Beach.",
            "Stay in the heart of the Venice boardwalk. Me and my husband love it here! We try to come at least once a year! Venice is such an awesome place we love it and the hotel is the best!!!! A California must do! Doesn't get more LA than this",
            "I was looking forward to staying at this hotel, because it was the most expensive, and I thought it would be the best, but you don't always get what you pay for. A partial ocean view upgrade is not worth the dance club next door pumping bass into your room until 3 AM, as well as the view of the garbage-can alley way. The hotel is set 200 yards off the ocean, so any ocean view is partially blocked by the boardwalk, a parking lot, and building or so. If I had the opportunity to give Joie De Vivre another chance, I probably wouldn't unless it was in a different location. Bring ear plugs, and watch for the shower water's changing temperatures, poor air circulation, and thin walls.",
            "Pretty satisfied with the hotel. It is very close to ocean, the stuff is friendly, rooms are clean. I would not recommend this place for couples, the area is not very nice in the evening. Don't use their own online booking system, when I arrived they couldn't find my reservation ) Another thing I didn't like, internet is not free ( Awesome bar on the top of the hotel.",
            "We recently spent 3 nights at the Hotel Erwin and thought it was a fantastic place to stay. The location is perfect. We booked a Premier Ocean View room and was given a room on the 5th floor. Go for the ocean view rooms. It is a lot of fun to watch all the Venice Beach happenings from the balcony. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. We ate dinner at Hash and thought it was delicious. Since we stayed over a weekend we were a bit concerned about noise coming from the nightclub High. We didn't have any issues at all. Our room was very quiet. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!",
            "My friends and I stayed at the Dogtown Suite for a birthday celebration. The room is epic! It captures the essence of the location. The white walls, immense space, and high wooden roof is exactly what you'd like to expect from a beachfront abode. However this place has a great kick of style with its clearly skateboard culture inspired decorations and it's own DJ booth! If you're looking for a beach getaway or looking to live like a rock star, this room will accommodate both ranges of taste and need. The hotel itself is in a great location. Everything, and I mean everything, is within walking distance. And if you're looking for a great bar and a great place to watch the sunset, definitely just go to the rooftop bar and you're set. It's a cozy place to socialize and have fun. So cozy, they'll even provide you with blankets! I highly recommend staying here with friends or a fun romantic weekend.",
            "Hotel Erwin is the best hotel in Venice. Let's face it, Venice is very eclectic and the locals are interesting. If you are not comfortable with \"weird\" people and street performers, the city of Venice is not for you. That's the character of the city. But the hotel has nothing to do with the people of Venice. We had a great time once we moved away from the main strip. The hotel staff were friendly and provided us with great service. The restaurant at the hotel just revamped their menu so we tried a lot of the entrees. The truffle fries are good, even the pickled egg salad was good. The burger was amazing! We have stayed with Hotel Erwin every time we have come to Venice and have never been disappointed. Hi Lounge provides an exceptional view of the city and I definitely recommend going there. And I definitely recommend Hotel Erwin.",
            "If you plan to stay in Venice Beach this is the place to get a room. And make sure you pay teh extra for a sea view too.. It's well worth the extra money. If you're not staying here then pay a visit at sunset for a drink on the roof terrace.. The sunset is spectacular.",
            "Wow. I have no idea how one hotel can provide so much incompetence. Unhelpful corporate reservations staff who provide inaccurate information. Preferred guest amenities that are promised and not delivered. Best Rate Guarantee submission ignored. At check-in, receptionist informed us that rooftop bar served food until 11PM. At 10:40, we were informed that they had made a \"last call\" at 10:20 and no food was available. No solutions offered by staff whose attitude seemed to be a surfer like \"bummer, dude.\" Filthy hallways. Unvacuumed room. And--get this--a half bag of cocaine lying next to the nightstand. Seriously?!? Do I have to look in the sheet for used condoms as well?!? No Manager available at 9:30AM to address these and other issues. Chaotic, understaffed front desk. Receptionists unable to direct other guests to Malibu. Answer? Go out to Lincoln Avenue, turn left, and follow Route 1. I know that and I don't even live there! Just one comic mistake after another with no redeeming qualities at all. OK, the view from the roof is nice at night. But absolutely no reason to stay here. Have a drink at the roof top (don't plan on eating though!) and then head back to any other hotel in the greater Los Angeles area. You'll thank me for skipping the Erwin; utter Hipster Hell.",
            "I stayed at the Hotel Erwin for New Years eve 12/31 to 1/3 and can't say enough good things about this lovely hotel. Near the Venice Boardwalk with ocean view rooms, this classy place boasts a fantastic rooftop bar called High, where the beautiful people gather to watch those spectcular sunsets over the Pacific. When it gets chilly, glowing heaters and soft white blankets make an evening under the stars simply magical. A great wine list, fantastic food in the restaurant. The staff is friendly and some great deals can be found on the internet periodically. The parking prices are pretty stiff, but still overall, a wonderful place to stay when visiting the eclectic Venice area.",
            "My husband and I stay at Joie de Vivre hotels often, but this is our first time here, It has a good beach location, but the front desk crew may have some kind of plan to divert you to a lower priced room. We had reserved a premium king ocean view many months ago, but upon our arrival we were placed in a room that was obviously not a king room and not at all as shown on their internet site. I was too tired to delve into this that night, but early the next morning, I called the front desk and after an involved conversation found out that indeed we were not in a king room. We would have our reserved room by 10 am--but still by 4 pm there was no room available, At this point I told them to forget it and that I would deal with it when I got home--suddenly there was a room available! WHy we were not in this room to begin with I have no idea as these rooms were not full, Is it some money making scheme on the part of management? Plus we were right under their rooftop bar and a loud loud bass pulsed through the room from 11:30 am until 10 at night. I would try their Huntington hotel if you want to stay at the beach as their staff is much better. I saw many foreign tourists staying here and I wondered if they were getting the rooms they had paid for ....",
            "We had the most enjoyable stay at then end of our Road Trip in Hotel Erwin. We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and discovered LA from there. At check in en during the whole we were provided with perfect service from Front Desk staff, who were always happy to answer any questions and give advice about what to visit in LA. The city tour booked by the front desk was very good. The beds in the rooms are really comfortable, big and soft. We also had a room at the alley, but did not have any noise from the bar next door. Very complete and original Mini bar items. It would be nice to have some smaller bottles of liquor in the mini bar. The only thing we missed in the room is a shaving mirror. We loved the complimentary Wolfgang Puck coffee in the room!!!! It is very recommendable to have breakfast and at least one dinner at Hash. The menu is not very big, but you will always find something of your choice. All dishes have a very original touch from the Chef. Prices are very friendly! Last night we were surprised by a fire alarm at 00:30 hours. We all had to leave the room because some joker activated the alarm. This all was handled very professionally by the staff members. If we return to LA, there is no doubt about where to stay.....",
            "Have just spent 5 nights at the Erwin, excellent friendly hotel and room was spot on in all respects. Room had a lovely balcony with great sunsets each evening and views of the mountains to the north and east. Would recommend to anyone who wants to spend time exploring Venice.",
            "I have been to the Erwin 3 times during the last 2 years, at different time of the year. It's a lovely and friendly place, in the heart of Venice beach, with comfortable, moder and clean bedrooms, great and unique view and a wonderful terrass on the roof to enjoy the view on Venice or the sunset on Santa Monica with a glass of champagne or a mojito. I love it, great vibe, clean, nice people, very helpful front desk, amazing place to stay",
            "We stayed at the hotel for two nights at the tail end of a two week vacation (a Premium King). We were initially hesitant given some of the reviews, but were glad we overlooked concerns expressed by others. The hotel was clean and well maintained, the staff were attentive and sincerely interested in guests being happy, and the location (a block from Venice Beach) was perfect. We stayed on the 6th floor, facing south, toward the west end of the hall -- good view of the beach and of the sunrise. There's a rooftop bar on the seventh floor that is worth a visit (especially around sundown) and a restaurant on the first floor (Hash) where guests get 25% off -- good food and very fair prices. It is worth joining the Joie de Vivre frequent stayers program before arriving -- a complementary beverage (half bottle of wine is one option) and free wifi is provided to members. All in all, we were pleased with the property and would not hesitate to return, especially given its location at the centre of Venice Beach.",
            "Was met by courteous staff, also able to check in early. Had a partial beach view. The room was arranged with the bed and chair facing the alley. I just moved the chair to the other side of the room and all was fine. It gave me a perfect view of the ocean, beach, and board walk. I skipped housekeeping for two days. They don't change you bed, they make up your bed. Have never been in a hotel that did that, but the sheets were not dirty so I didn't mind. The refrigerator was dirty on the outside, especially the handle and the clock radio.. It appeared that those items were repurposed but wasn't cleaned. properly. A+ for the bed and pillows. I got the room at Very reasonable price so I was a happy camper..",
            "Having arrived at this hotel in the rain it did not inspire me. It is a grotty part of Venice beach and the area does not encourage people to go and mingle in the locality. The rooms were clean and we were on the 5th. floor with a side view of the beach and the room was a fair size and clean and comfortable. The views from the rooftop bar were excellent. Breakfast was not included in the cost but served in the ground floor bar and was of good quality.",
            "For my wife's birthday I surprised her with a little weekend beach getaway. We could not have been happier with the time we had at Hotel Erwin in Venice. The rooftop bar at the hotel, \"High\", is amazing. I don't think there is a better place to watch a sunset in LA. The drinks hit the spot as well. After drinks, that Friday evening happened to also be \"First Friday\" on Abbot Kinney. Hotel Erwin is in a great location to walk to the street/food truck fair as well as everything else in the Venice Beach area. It was the perfect evening. The next morning could not have worked out better as well. Our with a delicious breakfast in Barlo was followed by a walk along the famous Venice boardwalk. The hotel is not only in the perfect location for the ideal LA beach experience, but it is extremely hip and comfortable at the same time. I highly recommend it.",
            "After a business meeting I wanted a hotel on the beach for 2 days of relax. I decided to splurge and booked an ocean view room at the Erwin. It turned out I was initially given a room with a faint glimpse of the sea, but after complaining I was indeed given a room with ocean view. It turned out to be a very pleasant two-days stay. Room cleanliness could have been better, and the room was OK but nothing special -- but I decided I was willing to pay for the view. One is located at the center of the action in Venice, and beach access is, well, immediate. The roof top lounge is very pleasant, an excellent way to waste an evening in good company.",
            "Great hotel with friendly staff in a fabulous location. If you are at all precious it is probably not the place for you as at night time it is a little dark and ominous walking around but if you have a car Santa Monica is minutes away. Yes the parking is $25 a night but honestly how many hotels do not charge for parking and at least you know your car will be there the next day. The rooftop bar had stunning views although only open Thurs to Sat at the moment. Venice Beach was as vibrant and ecclectic as ever. Like I said not for the precious as you definatelly see all sorts but I loved the energy of the place. The 1 Bedrooms are spacious and had great amenities. Spring for the view rooms as it is worth it. Did not get to eat at the restaurant but the prices seemed reasonable. Would stay here again but you really need a car but that is really the case with all of L.A if you want a bit of freedom. I am a travel agent would not hesitate to recommend to the right clients. Great Value for money",
            "This hotel is very close to the beach which is its only good point as far as I'm concerned. Room rate 202 UD per night RO but upon check out noticed that the tax was charged at 14%. Views from balcony left a lot to be desired as did the unwashed glasses left in our room. Despite the web site stating that all rooms have flat screen TVs and ipod docks our room had neither. Menus postioned in tiny lobby did not display prices. No guest information in rooms and no information forthcoming from the guy at checkout who's only mission was to ask us to upgrade to a more expensive room. Only one elevator which was very busy and meant that we had to carry three heavy suitcases down the stairs for our waiting taxi. Despite filling in an online feedback form and e mailing the GM I have received no response.",
            "My boyfriend and I recently visited Venice Beach on our yearly California vacation. Last minute, we decided to go to Venice Beach. We parked the car, and started walking around looking for a hotel. The first place we saw was Hotel Erwin, right on the beach practically! We walked in and asked for the rates and availability for one night. Miguel was extremely helpful, and got us all set up in a great room with an Ocean view on the top floor with a great balcony. The room was not huge, but not small either. It was roomy enough, and the decor was very modern. We were very happy that we stayed there, and look forward to vacation next year. One other great thing about this hotel is valet. Although it is a fee, everywhere in Venice charges for parking, and the hotel had in and out privileges. They also let us get something we left out of the car at 2.00am which was very nice. The day of check out, they let us check out late, and then we were allowed to leave our car parked there for a while, while we got a quick bite to eat. All in all it was a great experience!",
            "The hotel has so many advantages over the other options in the area that it is a no contest. Best location, easy access, free parking. Very comfortable , ample, and clean rooms for it's category , good restaurant and not too expensive. But the best part is the quality of service and the knowledge the staff has about their work and of the Mayaguez area. They volunteered information that was very useful and all this with a smile. It is a comfort to notice that the hotel has more than adequate but not obtrusive security, you know there's someone watching what is happening in the property.",
            "Hotel Erwin is the hidden treasure of California. Their staff and hotel is fresh and stylish. The room we stayed at was clean and very home like. We had a view of the Pacific Ocean that was only 500 yards away. It is right in the heart of Venice Beach and is on the pulse of the culture . It's roof top bar is fun for socializing and can be romantic as you watch a California sunset on the ocean horizon. We will definitely be reserving a room there for our next visit this summer.",
            "I work in travel and have stayed at many hotels in my line of work, and I can't say enough good things about my stay at the Hotel Erwin. You can't beat the location right next to Venice Beach. Also, the rooftop bar called High, had spectacular views of the ocean and city. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Lastly, the beds are extremely comfortable and the brunch in their restaurant 'Hash' hit the spot right before spending the day walking around Venice. Two thumbs up for Hotel Erwin. Check out some of the street performers on the boardwalk in Venice. I saw a man jump over 10 other spectators! It was great.",
            "Following the glowing reviews of The Erwin, we booked the hotel on Hotwire, where it is presented as a 3.5 stars hotel in Santa Monica/Venice/Marina del Ray. When we arrived at the hotel we were offered an \"upgrade\" at a price 40% higher from our \"deluxe\" room. We asked to see both rooms only to realize that the \"deluxe\" room is a substandard room on the third floor, poorly equipped. For instance: the TV is older, smaller screen variant, the security lock on the door was broken, the sink stop was missing and the shower head hardly functional. The troubles continued with poor housekeeping that tended to show up daily around 6 PM, just as we were getting ready for dinner. Out attempts to have them come during the day were futile. Further, even with their late schedule and despite our daily tips, the work was simply sub-par, requiring complaints to the front desk and daily revisits. All in all, we were relieved to depart and glad that we didn't opt for the \"upgrade\"",
            "I stayed with my 2 young children, and the room as clean, spacious enough, and the location was fantastic - a few feet from the beach AND a great playground! There are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Staff was helpful, though since it is the beach there is a laid-back vibe. Nice views from rooftop bar. We booked a suite so we would have a kitchenette plus a little more room for the kids, which was great.",
            "We stayed at Hotel Erwin for 4 nights at the end of September and overall enjoyed our stay. We booked the Premier Ocean View King room expecting our room to face the ocean, only to find it was on the side of the building so really only Partial Views (refer photo). If you look straight out from the room you do not see the beach, only the rooftops of nearby buildings but once you get out on the balcony and look to the left, you can see the ocean and beach quite clearly. Despite this we found the price we paid to be great value as the room was very modern and new (we were on the 5th floor I think) and the bed and pillows were unbelievably comfortable! In fact this alone made staying at the Erwin worth it! The High Rooftop Lounge you must check out. We initally made the mistake of just looking at it from the lift and it doesn't look like much from there. But walk down and you'll see great cozy lounge areas and fantastic views of the ocean, with Santa Monica and the city lights in the distance. The Hash restaurant was ok, a little overpriced and limited, and the inside section doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the renovation - a bit dated I would say. The outdoor tables though are much better as long as it's a nice day out there. We had breakfast there one morning which was great. As far as the location goes it is great for the beach, it also is quite close to LAX airport without being on the flight path. But we did spend a lot of money and time on transport to Hollywood and Disneyland etc. If we came back to Venice Beach Hotel Erwin is definitely where we would stay...",
            "The incredible location is just the beginning, from the moment you enter the staff at this chic boutique hotel makes you feel at home. Super-close to the Venice Boardwalk it was easy to rent a bike and ride to Santa Monica. The Hotel Erwin is close to amazing dining in Venice, Santa Monica and Marina Del Ray. A really perfect spot to enjoy some of the best of So. California. Check-in was quick and easy and the suite I stayed in was very comfortable and well-appointed. The wet bar was complete with dishes and silverware and I loved the sunglasse honor bar offering! The pillows and bedding were incredible and made for a very good night's sleep. The large and fluffy towels were the only thing that could have lured me out of the shower. Great rain shower head and perfect water pressure. Each room has it's own balcony with seating - but for a night out the rooftop lounge, HIGH was a great place to grab handcrafted cocktail and mingle with tourists and locals alike. One one particiular evening in addition to the heaters we were offered blankets to make our expeirence more enjoyable. It seems that no attention detail was omitted at Hotel Erwin. I have found \"my\" place in Venice Beach!",
            "We booked our stay at \"The Erwin\" while staying in Las Vegas on summer vacation. Drove down on a Saturday morning and back on a Sunday night. Should mention we live in New York City. Never having been in L.A. before we had no expectations. The reservations agent was most helpful when I requested a suite with a view. He did mention it was ocean view, not ocean front. We were on the third floor, on the alley side, last room at the back. We did look onto the alleyway but could see some of he beach. While the view did not lend itself to sitting out on the balcony, it did have a certain Bohemian flavor. The room itself had a retro 70's feel with a comfortable living room and kitchen area, a separate bedroom with a nice king size bed, and a sink area outside the shower/toilet area. The colors were lively and the room had a certain charm to it. The hotel is two minutes from the Venice beachfront, which is a truly unique experience. Recalling we are from NYC, it all reminded us of Greenwich Village. While the quality of service and accomodations were above average, the whole Hotel Erwin/Venice Beach experience is a little quirky and should be approached with an open mind. We really enjoyed ourselves and wished we had a few more days. The valet was $27, but they were quick and helpful and it was very convenient. We highly recommend HASH for breakfast. The food was excellent ( oatmeal, great wheat toast, freshberries and a tasty corned beef hash) and the service friendly and helpful. We look forward to returning next summer and enjoying an ocean front room this time. Make sure you see the Snake Lady!! !",
            "I LOVE the Marina Pacific Hotel. I visit the Marina Pacific every 3 to 4 months to recharge. It is my home away from home. All my friends and family know this is \"my\" hotel. The rooms are great. The construction took awhile but was worth the wait. I'm anxious for the restaurant and room service hopefully. Everyone from the front desk to the housekeeping staff always go out of their way to make sure my stay is as wonderful as possible. It's close to the airport so a shuttle from the airport is easy and convenient. Hanging out at the Venice Beach boardwalk is fun and free entertainment just watching all the people. It's fun to sit on the balcony and watch the crowds from the comfort of your room if you feel like it. Lots of good resturants within walking distance and some even deliver. If I ever ran away from home, this is where my family would find me. :o)",
            "From the location to the decor this hotel is a little piece of hipster heaven. Lucky for us it's just what we were looking for. The room was spacious and had really cool furnishings, and the beds were comfortable. Unfortunately the bathroom left a lot to be desired. The tub was tiny and the toilet was behind a frosted glass door (zero privacy)! We tried the Hash restaurant for brunch which was quite good and relatively reasonable. The location was good in the daytime (minutes from the beach) but sketchy at night, and walkable evening food options were limited (not the fault of the hotel but something to be aware of). We got a very reasonable deal on this property through Expedia and felt that the value for what we paid was good, however if we were paying the rack rate we would likely have been disappointed. Next time we're in the area we'd probably stay in Santa Monica instead of Venice Beach.",
            "We arrived after a long drive from Vegas on our recent trip from the UK. We were given a complementary room upgrade as we are members of the Joy of Life Club and a bottle of wine in our room which is a really nice touch. We originally planned to stay for only one night before moving to the Angelino, but we liked the vibe and location of the Erwin so much we asked Eugene, on the front desk, if we could transfer our booking for the rest of our stay, before we flew back home. Eugene went above and beyond, and made a call to make the arrangements and managed to get the cancellation charge waived. Everything ran smoothly and we had confirmation e-mails in our inbox within the hour. The following morning, Miguel was on front desk duties and helped us check out and check back in, even keeping the same room and rate, so there was no impact on us at all. He also helped with directions downtown and local bike hire. These two guys are a credit to the hotel and helped make our stay at the Erwin perfect.",
            "This is a stylish, modern hotel just a block from the beach. Venice is \"quirky,\" probably not for everyone. It may have the filthiest sidewalks in the US and perhaps the largest or at least most visible homeless population. But the hotel is very classy with a good small restaurant and rooftop bar with a great view. A seven-story building is a tower in Venice, and you can see all of LA from the roof. We liked our room with an ocean view. The location is very central. It's maybe a 40 minute walk on the boardwalk to the Santa Monica Pier. An express bus from Union Station stops a block away, and it was an easy bus ride to the Getty Center. Don't be misled: L:A has good public transit. We liked the hotel and found Venice really interesting. There is a good restaurant on the boardwalk about ten minutes north: The Fig Tree.",
            "I have stayed at the Erwin a couple of times for business, and found the hotel to be quite pleasant. It is located close to the beach in \u201cdowntown\u201d Venice Beach, so expect the VB experience once you leave the hotel. On the inside the hotel is modern with spacious, nicely decorated and equipped rooms and suites. Ask for a room on the North side of the hotel and towards the beach if you prefer quiet. They have a roof-top bar and seating area, and a bar and small dining area next to the lobby. Service at check-in and check-out can be slow If you arrive by car you\u2019ll have to do street or valet parking, valet adds $27 to your bill. Try Benice next door for breakfast.",
            "I was in a laid-back mood on this vacation, so it didn't really bother me to discover....the hot water heater was out! The staff was extremely apologetic about it, had contractors in non-stop to fix it, and offered a set-aside room that did have hot running water, where guests could reserve time slots & keys to shower. I was promised a satisfactory discount upon checkout, and this was forthcoming without me having to even mention it. The location is great, decor is cute, price is affordable. Venice and Santa Monica are quite pedestrian-friendly, compared with L.A. proper; I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go (such as to a hairstylist to get a shampoo and blowout). Note: do check on the supply of caffeinated vs. decaf coffee pods before you go to sleep; our decaf was replenished every day but we had to ask for caffeinated ones.",
            "I stayed here at the beginning of October with my wife, it was the start of our honeymoon and it couldn't have got any better. The hotel is in a sweet location, mere metres from the Venice boardwalk, it's also opposite a couple of the better restaurants around Venice Beach ( notably Danny's.) The staff were attentive and really went out of their way to help you out. There was even a free breakfast for anyone and everyone on the second morning of our stay! ( Topped off with a DJ playing tunes all morning.) The room was spacious and very unique - with a massive plasma tv and a bunch of cable channels. The balcony overlooked the beach and was much utilised as we chilled out with a few gin and tonics at sunset. I took up an 'Ink & Stay' package - where as you get a hotel room ( a very spacious ocean-view 1 bedroom apartment,) and a $100 tattoo voucher to use at a neighbourhood tattoo shop ( Great artist as well - Lucky from 'Sea Of Ink' did my work and I was very impressed with it. I think they may use another tattooist as well, Graffitti artist Norm - who I believe painted the mural at the front of the lobby.) I even got a free bottle of Patron tequilla to drink the pain away. Anyway, 'Hash' the restaurant serves the best brekkie in town - everything we ate there was superb and the rooftop bar is cool and full of beautiful people. Cocktails were grand and if you're staying at the hotel I believe you get guaranteed access to the bar ( it's a hit on weekends.) I couldn't recommend this hotel enough, it's so fu$%king good. I intend to visit again next time I'm on the West Coast and I'll be recommending to any Australian that makes it know that their heading over to the States to hang out at Venice Beach.",
            "Funky bedroom styling, although ensuite in our room had not been refurbished yet so was a little at odds with the rest of the decor. Fantastic roof terrace for sundowners Only one lift, so might have to walk the stairs sometimes In walking distance of shops and bars of Abbott kiney street, so guaranteed a good night out and plenty of cool shops to potter about in. Might want to bring your skateboard for Venice beach! Only valet parking at $25 a day so may need to be creative with your parking options - can park in carpark odjacent to hotel for $8 aday until 11pm. There is also free parking on street from 6.30pm until 8am outside subway sandwiches opposite.Didn't get to eat at the hash restaurant attached to the hotel but it all looked god and was reasonable price.Would definitely stay there again, but would get a sea facing room next time",
            "Living in downtown Los Angeles, i was feeling the need to escape the heat and be near the ocean to celebrate my birthday with a few of my close girlfriends for the weekend. I couldn't have chosen a better place to do just this other than Hotel Erwin. Being familiar with the Joie De Vivre group, I knew that I would be pleased with my experience. We had a great room on the 6th floor (the very top) that opened up to a cozy balcony with a fantastic ocean view. Working in Hollywood 10 hours a day, everyday, I was well over due to for a relaxing ocean breeze, that was mine to be had only a short 20 miles away. My girlfriends joined me at the hotel to have a glass of wine at HIGH and then we ventured off to Wasabi, probably one of the best sushi joints in the area (on Abbot Kinney). I didn't want to leave so I stayed a 2nd night and then enjoyed breakfast at HASH on my way back to downtown. I look forward to my next stay at Erwin & would highly recommend the 6th floor rooms with the balcony!",
            "We were supposed to stay there for two nights but we loved the suite so much that we cancel led our other booking to stay at the Erwin for the rest of our holidays in LA. The style of the room is great, very 70's, very california, really cool.The staff is super friendly and the bar on the roof is a must go (don't forget your jumper, you will be on top of the building facing the ocean so it is always cold up there). The only thing we found a little cheap was to charge for the internet wifi but withour asking they removed it from our bill so nothing to complain about! Will definitely go back at the Erwin whenever I go back to Venice beach.",
            "Married in 2005 on the Podium on Venice Beach we return each year for our anniversery and attend the Muscle Beach tournament on Labor Day. This year will be our 6th time. We discovered the Marina Pacific (as it was then) and never looked back. The Erwin has been re-furbished and last year for our first visit we were not dissapointed. The staff excel and nothing is ever too much trouble. Food is varied and room service good. Clean and very comfortable, we are particularly fond of a long serving cleaner on the 4th floor. Straight out of the door and straight onto the Boardwalk. We hardly venture far as everything we need is within walking distance, but for the sightseers the buses are on the doorstep. See you soon Hotel Erwin. We're coming back.",
            "Although my wife and I checked in at 2AM, the room was well situated on the 6th floor, northside, with a great view of the Pacific, Venice, and all along the hills to the HOLLYWOOD sign. Having a a walk out terrace with the room was a perk. Breakfast the next morning at HASH, the inhouse restaurant was superb, and the staff seemed pleasant and geared to customer comfort. We would come back and stay again, if circumstances permitted.",
            "The only bad thing I can say is that we only stayed for one night en route to Vegas. From check in until check out everything was perfect. I have stayed before when it was a Best Western and they have made massice improvements. Loved it and will return for a longer stay.",
            "The staff is great. Friendly from the front desk to the maintenance people. If you had a question they would answer it with more than just a passing interest. We booked the hotel and they talked us in to upgrading to a balcony room overlooking the ocean which was great. We loved sitting out on the balcony and drinking a beer and toasting the sunset. The down side is there is a rooftop bar which was right over our head and the music pounded until 1 or 2 in the morning. We were on the room closest to the Ocean on the 6th floor (top) and we talked with people more towards the back (same view pretty much) and they said that they could not hear the music. I will say that we did not ask to be moved after the first day (we just stayed two days). The music did not bother us too bad, we are both pretty heavy sleepers, but I can see how it could really bother some people. We ate breakfast at the hotel and it was great. We are probably more Santa Monica people than Venice, but the staff made the stay worth while and if Venice beach is what you want, this is the place for you. Our room was very nice remodeled, not too big, but nice. Good beds, a small refrigerator and a safe in your room. The balcony with chairs was the best part of all.",
            "Stayed at the Erwin at Venice Beach for two nights with the room being great with a view over the beach. It is on the coast and not far from all of the main attractions of LA... although it is a location of its own well worth a visit. It really is the location that is the hit for those who like a stay on the fringe of life. The beach front holds one transfixed by the characters that frequent it along with their antics [don't be fooled as some of this is part of an act and some of these people are talented folk who choose this way of life] admid the tattoo parlours, outlet stores and medicinal cannabis locations. It is the later that gives this area an interesting \"breeze\" that might not be for some... as \"the breeze\" is there almost 24/7. The Hotel has a fantastic roof top bar above \"the breeze\" that has an uninterupted view to all points of the compass and a great little restaurant that is well appointted as well as serves excellent food. However, when staying here get out onto the breach front and have a meal at the \"Side Walk Cafe\" so you can be entertained by the side show... it is well worth it!",
            "if you're looking for a fun, funky, friendly and fresh place to stay in Venice Beach then Hotel Erwin is the spot. i accompanied my husband (work for him; leisure trip for me) and we stayed for 2 nights. i searched the internet for over a month looking for the perfect spot and we found it. The hotel is 1/2 block from the boardwalk--can't beat the location. The staff was friendly the minute we walked in (hello, Miguel!). The rooftop bar/restaurant at sunset--complete with heaters, couches and blankets---was so beautiful. The restaurant (LUSH) was amazing. We went to LUSH our first night and we split an entree (after having cocktails and appetizers on the rooftop)---the lasagna was so good, that we ordered another piece before finishing the first one. The room was clean--i appreciated the cotton bedding, the tile floor (hate carpet in hotels), the orchid flower, and the bathroom goodies. Seriously, we have never written a review for Trip Advisor but we just had to write one for Hotel Erwin after staying there. Things you should know: valet parking is $25 per night and the rooms on the south side would probably be preferable to those on the north side--city/beach view vs. alley view,",
            "Hotel Erwin was one of my little splurges on my last trip in SoCal...my boyfriend and I were looking forward to a boutique eclectic style experience & Hotel Erwin did not disappoint. During our stay, the hotel was undergoing some renovations however, we were not inconvenienced what so ever & the $10 restaurant vouchers in exchange for the disturbance made up for it. The service at this hotel was exceptional; Anderson the Valet was a gem. He catered to all our needs and went way beyond the duties of his job title. We also had a chance to try their new restaurant which was slightly pricey for breakfast but the choices were so interesting & yummy we didn't really care when the bill came! Another fun feature of the hotel is the rooftop deck with the cozy couches and a perfect view of Venice Beach!",
            "My wife, 10-year-old daughter, and I had a great experience staying in a suite at the Hotel Erwin. The room was great, service was excellent all-around, with special kudos to front desk person Miguel, who went out of his way to to assist us with traveling advise, recommendations, etc. The outside of the hotel was unimpressive as major renovations were being made to the exterior and it was covered with scaffolding, but the suite was delightful. You're one block from the beach. If you're looking for pure relaxation and beautiful surroundings, this is probably not where you want to stay. You're in the heart of the very lively Venice Beach neighborhood which is very active and a little scruffy, but the hotel itself was delightful. If you want to stay in Venice, this is a great place to be.",
            "My wife, new born, and I stayed in Venice beach for one night, but wish we were there longer. We reserved a one bedroom suite which was colorfully decorated and had a great view of the beach. The beds were comfortable and we wish it was colder the night we stayed, because we would have used the fireplace. We did not eat at Hash or have a drink at High, but overheard a guest raving about the food. So it must be good! Everyone was friendly and provided us with the information we needed to get around - find Starbucks, the reatuarant we were meeting friends at, and refuel are car. The bellmen were quick and friendly. I highly reccomend staying here if you are in the area.",
            "I stayed at Hotel Erwin for a weekend getaway with a girlfriend last May. We just wanted a good old Venice, beachy, fun girls' weekend out. The room started us off right - so 60's Venice! Bright colors, skateboards, butterfly chirs and a grand ocean/boardwalk view (always entertaining). We had cocktail on the Roof (High) both evenings at sunset, which was beyond compare. The staff (Erin) was SUPER helpful offering suggestions of where to have fun on Saturday - drove up the coast to Malibu after a great breakfast at Hash! Can't wait to go again! !",
            "We booked this hotel after being advised by the travel agent it's perfect for access into Hollywood etc. We advised the travel agent at the time of booking we did not want to be hiring a car and they advised this was fine. The hotel was $100 taxi ride from Hollywood/Beverly Hills and the area the hotel was situated in was not nice, and not safe for two young girls to go out in the evening. Santa Monica pier was about a mile walk away. If you're looking for a hotel which is near to the sights of Hollywood etc, then this is not the hotel for you.The hotel itself was beautiful and the rooms were very spacious, with incredibly comfy beds! We had a few nights were people were being noisy, and even attempted to bang into our door at 3am to find they had the wrong room! The restaurant was lovely, and so were the staff so all in all the hotel was great, the location was not.",
            "I have stayed at the Hotel Erwin four times over the past three years (most recently December 11). The location is great and the overall vibe of the property is cool, hip, and funky. It seems that the management believes the great location and the cool vibe is all it needs to be successful. There doesn't appear to be a guest service focus at all. The service at the front desk is painfully slow and unattentiive. As others have said, the rooms are in need of maintenance and updating. Nothing serious, they are just tired. In spite of the poor guest service and the need for room maintenance, the Hotel Erwin is a good choice if you want to stay in Venice. Just don't expect four star service and accomandations.",
            "I chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor recommendations as I was looking for something different to the standard chain hotels. The location is good (very close to the beach and a long-ish walk to Santa Monica). The hotel had an interesting retro vibe, and the roof deck is cool. The staff were friendly and helpful. My only gripe was that the 'free wi fi' is only 'free' if you join their club; which is in turn free but a pain nonetheless. Overall we had a nice stay at the hotel.",
            "Roof top bar was amazing with a beatiful view of the sunset. The bartender was very friendly and had some great recommendations of other cool places for us to visit while we were in the area. We had one rainy day while in Venice so it was great to have a suite to kick back and watch a movie in our room. The hotel gives you the option of going green and of course we did....what a great idea!! Coupons to use for dinner in the restaurant! Wonderful food (the shrimp and grits were fantastic) While eating at Barlo we checked in on \"Yelp\" and was able to recieve a free cocktail, which was awesome! The young lady at the front desk was very friendly and made the arrival and check out process very smooth. Will definitely be going back!",
            "The Hotel Erwin is a great place to stay. It is just a little let down by it's surroundings. I do admit our visit was 'out of season' April, but side streets, and general area, were a little run down. We didn't feel comfortable venturing out at night, but the Erwin has a great alternative - the roof top bar 'High'. It is very cool, and has amazing views (especially at night) across LA. The room's were good, and we had a free upgrade for one of them (for a Facebook 'like!) to a suite, really nice to have dinning table, settee, and kitchenette, in a good size room. Our breakfast in 'Eat', was ok, but was served warm, not hot. Service at the desk was great, in addition to the response's from my 'online' questions, prior to our visit. I would recommend a stay at the Erwin (for great access to Venice Beach), they do know how to look after you.",
            "The restaurant is new remodeled and the food is amazing. The atmosphere is stylish and the service was great. I'm a salmon lover and I can't say enough about how flavorful it was. My friends had the burgers and they love it. If your in the Venice area or staying at this hotel you have to check out the restaurant.",
            "I used to stay at this hotel when it was a Best Western. I have to say I preferred it then. Its now very chic and very expensive. They have taken away the inclusive breakfast, shuttle to Santa Monica and the valet parking is compulsory. It's very pretentious (stupid coffee makers) though the art on the wall remains as good as it always was. It was the only room on our 9 hotel vacation where the wi-fi was restricted to members. The room is full of things to buy and one gets the feeling that it's pay-pay-pay. The new roof terrace is great but very overpriced drinks have a compulsory 18% service charge added. We paid extra for a sea view room but it was very noisy due to the music on the roof. It can't say its a bad hotel. It isn't. But it belongs in Santa Monica - not the more relaxed Venice Beach.",
            "We had a great stay at the Erwin, and the staff really made it more enjoyable. The front desk staff was very welcoming, and very resourceful when it came to suggesting local places to visit or eat. The rooms are nicely designed and very clean - we enjoyed our room on the 6th floor facing north which gave us a great view from the balcony of the Venice Beach Boardwalk right below us. Their restaurant, Hash, had amazing food - a destination even for those not staying at the hotel. And the rooftop lounge/deck High is awesome.",
            "The Hotel Erwin lived up to every review I read, and every good thing I'd heard about it! We were given premium treatment from the moment we pulled up to the front doors, until our departure the next day. The valet service was efficient and affordable, and the staff who greeted us at our car were very polite and helpful. At the front desk we were greeted by a friendly and gregarious gentleman, who invited us to \"sing for our room\" and gave a heartfelt example of how to do so. Our room was very large, light, comfortable, and beautifully and artfully decorated. Every inch of it was designed to inspire, please and captivate. It fully captured all the spirit and energy of the beach, and was a terrific addition to our visit there. This hotel is literally in the middle of everything! We were very pleased with how easy it was to reach from the highway, and how close it was to the beach, and the famous four corners in Venice. While we didn't have the time to enjoy the pool deck, I did run up to check it out, and it was every bit as lovely as I'd heard it was! On my next visit I will be sure to take full advantage of it. Our stay was part of a very special Birthday celebration, and to this day, we talk about how well this hotel complimented our experience. I would happily plan my next trip to LA around staying at the Erwin.",
            "Spent my birthday weekend at Erwin. They made me feel like a rock star! Everyone from housekeeping to management goes out of their way to make sure my stay is always great. They are helpful, will give suggestions on places to go and what to see. If you have any questions or needs, all you have to do is ask...if they don't ask you first.",
            "I stayed here for my honeymoon in October 2008 for 3 days. We were given a room on the top floor, which is their newly remodeled floor. When we checked in, the front desk clerk was not polite, we were treated like a lower class that some how got on the upper floor. We were given a room between two rooms having construction done. So we were woken up each morning at about *:30 am or so, by loud voices, hammering, and music. The last night there, I was bitten several times by something in the bed. When I told the front desk at breakfast, they told me it was something probably from the beach. They then said they were going then to check our room. When we got up there nothing looked like it had been moved or disturbed. We decided to check out not long after that. When I asked to speak to the manager, I was told he was not available, but that he would be calling me in the next 24 hours. Needless to say I never heard anything. I tried calling the hotel, sending an email, still never heard anything. Only after I complained to Best Western directly, did I get told that the hotel claimed they had fixed everything with me already. Shortly after I recieved a generic hotel apology. To top it off, we had to pay an extra $15.00 plus tax per a night for parking.",
            "this review is for a deluxe king bed room only. other rooms may vary. valet parking only. for $28/night. you can't access your stuff in the vehicle once it's parked. cheaply built. un-tasteful art. but drug addicts or underground punk band members might like it. un-family friendly. not satisfied at all aside from the fact that you can walk to the beach. the deluxe room doesnt have a microwave. i have a baby that feeds thrice at night. theyre asking for $60 for rm upgrade w/ microwave. cant provide a microwave for a single night. no refrigerator. they only have the chiller. a very small one at that. i want to stock some ice cream in the ref for the children cause it's hot. but not possible in this deluxe room. there's no sense of elegance inside and out at all.",
            "We stayed at Hotel Erwin for one night and enjoyed our stay very much. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view suite and the room was clean and comfortable. Pros - location (just a block walk to the beach!) - service (everyone was friendly and went out of their way to help you) - managers reception (free wine/beer for an hour while getting the chance to talk to staff/get recommendations for local sites) - valet (fast and friendly) - decor (artsy and fun) - rooftop bar (amazing view) Con (just one!) - slooooow elevator. There is only one for guests and it would take several minutes each time we wanted to use it. May not sound like a lot, but when you are just standing there waiting it seems like forever. Also, I have to disagree with anyone else who has commented about the lack of restaurants or nightlife. We saw 5-6 places to eat within a few blocks and ended up at a great place called Bindi BBQ. You bring your own liquor and the food is great. We were able to bar hop to a few places from there. Granted they aren\u2019t all right next door (although there is a great bar next to Bindi BBQ/a block from the hotel where we played pool), they are close enough to walk. So it is an option for those who want to go out at night.",
            "I had the distinct pleasure of staying at the Hotel Erwin over Christmas vacation. The service was wonderful. Each member of the staff was friendly and attentive. The beds were comfy, and the view of the beach is ever so inviting. For a more panoramic view of Venice, you can go to the roof top bar and enjoy the sea air. The food at Hash, the restaurant just off of the lobby, was fabulous for breakfast. I suggest the corned beef and hash. It is not from a can, it is in the spirit of the recipe, using actual corned beef and potatoes. I also had a chai latte, which was huge and very refreshing. Will, who works at Hash, sat us and gave us excellent service. He also brought us breakfast via room service the next day, and I have to tell you, his service was just as incredible. If you ever find yourself in Venice and need a place to stay, check it out!",
            "I live in San Diego and work throughout the state along with other states in the nation. Have been working and traveling for 8 years of my life and stayed in some nice spots. Hotel Erwin however was one of the nicest and cleanest places I have been in a long time. The room was clean and retrofitted with all the right amenities. The staff was super signed me up for Joy Luck club at the front desk and provide us with super service on the rooftop lounge. The location is ideal in the heart of Veince Beach, CA. A rooftop lounge that overlooks the beach and ocean! As I said I live in CA and I felt as if I were on vacation up there. Perfect spot to bring clients/customers in LA to relax and enjoy the weather above all the crazies below. If you have people from out of state this is the place to take them!!! Food, Drinks and best spot in town to people watch not to mention night life around the hotel all with in walking distance. Breakfast at Hash was super! All in all a perfect stop on my business travels and one that I will come back too. I am now planning my travels around JDV Hotels locations throughout the State!",
            "The staff was very professional, kind and courteous and everyone seemed to be genuinely happy. The room that I stayed in was absolutely amazing. The Hotel is classy and has a rooftop bar. Couldn't make it up there during their hours but appeared to be cool. The location is unbeatable - less than a block away from Venice Beach - and the balcony had a great view of the beach (it helped that the weather was great). While the room wasn't ready for an early check-in, there was maybe a ten minute wait (that was spent walking to the beach) and it was all ready. I highly recommend checking it out. Even if it is to go to the rooftop bar for a drink and a great view.",
            "A friend and I were driving from Vegas to San Diego last week and made a last minute decision to stop off in LA for a night, and found a cheap room at the Erwin via ebookers.com. We read the reviews on Tripadvisor, but you can never be totally sure... However, they are totally justified. Amazing hotel! Srsly cool. We had a kitchen and balcony and partial ocean view. The room was great and actually looked nicer than the photos - funky decor, perfectly clean, cool neon bathrobes, valet parking... TV, nice bathroom... The staff were really helpful, the location is cool, right on the beach, and 10 mins walk from Abbot Kinney (great coffee shops, boutiques and restaurants). I would totally stay there again and have already recommended it to friends.",
            "We stayed at the Erwin for three nights as part of a longer trip to California. On arrival the valet parking was efficient and reception staff were friendly. However, once we saw our room - small, no safe, very old fashioned bathroom, view on to a busy road - we were surprised, given the pictures on the website. The staff were helpful and moved us to a much larger room with a safe and more modern bathroom. However, we then found that building work was taking place directly under the room, which started at 8.30am on each of the three mornings. There was also a lift shaft in the room, which we assume took snacks up to the bar from the kitchen - this rattled away until about 10.30pm. In between this, the road outside was very noisy with deliveries being made in the side alley at 4.30am one morning! The location of the hotel is very good for Venice Beach but you can't actually get into the hotel from the beach, you go round the front which is not the most picturesque to say the least. There is a little patio to eat/drink but you are basically sitting on a main road so we ate in the restaurant one evening - we were the only guests and one of the five main courses was unavailable. They were upgrading the restaurant so this may have improved now. The roof top bar has impressive views. However, you need to book a table since when we went up (on a Tuesday night) it was completely full and we couldn't sit down - although locals seemed to be squeezed in! The hotel were apologetic about the noise and did give us a refund on our valet parking, which we appreciated. However, we'd have preferred a hotel where we could get a nice meal and a good night sleep!",
            "Quite a funky hotel to stay in,we were upgraded to a suite which has a kitchen in it which gave extra space.The highlight was the rooftop lounge which has 360 views over Los Angeles a brilliant spot to sit and watch the amazing Californian sunsets from while drinking a watermelon margarita.The hotel staff were so helpful especially Eugene at the desk and Chip .I wish that there had been more areas to sit inside the hotel,the bar/restaurant was small,and I was not very keen on the area,but a very popular hotel not maybe suitable for families with children",
            "I stayed here with our two boys - 7 and 9. They loved the lollipops at the front desk, the cool one bedroom suite that we were upgraded to, the food at Hash, the view of the Hollywood sign at High, the cool location right by Venice Beach. I would definitely stay here again.",
            "My Husband and I stayed at Hotel Erwin for one night. I took part in their \"Ink N Wink\" package! The tat came out better than I could have ever imagined. I got a a pretty large one I might add so it took longer than expected. Hotel was very understanding and allowed us to have extended chack out. The front desk concierge-Migel I believe his name was had a very welcoming smile and was very attentive to all requests. The room was great.We had a one bedroom suite. The balcony over looking the boardwalk was amazing. My only gripe was the bathroom, very small although nicly tiled. Fireplace was very easy to operate. They also have a great goody box in the kitchette that had interesting products you don't see in many places. I work in the hotel busniess and have never given a property five stars-but Erwin has one me over! The customer service was the best that I have seen in many years of traveling.Thank you Erwin for a truly memorable stay-I'm not just saying that because I got inked!-)",
            "Hotel has great restaurant and rooftop bar which attracts visitors from afar. You can see for miles and great for sunsets. Only thing for us which was strange was the room decor but this did not detract from our stay and maybe fits the theme of Venice Beach as it is a weird experience overall. We had a great stay and reception staff were great and very helpful if you needed anything. Very interesting visit and everyone should have a couple of nights here just to people watch. Beachside restaurants great and very good value.",
            "We stayed at Hotel Erwin for a weekend getaway and it was a much needed break. I loved the fact that we could watch the free entertainment on Venice Beach, but when we neeed to escape the madness, Hotel Erwin was right there. You can't beat the location and our view of the ocean was amazing. The beds were super comfortable too! I highly suggest the rooftop lounge because they have an amazing view of the Venice Beach, and the drinks were great. Pricy, but well worth it. The staff were friendly and accomodating. I would definitely come back to this place..",
            "I stayed with the Erwin over the weekend and had a great stay! The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly and the room itself was fresh and comfortable. I work in the hotel industry and have stayed at a lot of hotels. I give the Erwin two thumbs up. The bed at the Erwin was comfortable, which ranks high on my requirements given my propensity for back problems. You can't beat the location and if you've got a little extra to spend then I highly recommend getting a room with a view and on the 6th floor. The 6th floor has balconies, so you can order room service and have breakfast outside looking at the beach. There is a rennovation taking place, but it didn't disrupt my stay. Asdies from some scaffolding outside, I didn't notice it. There aren't many restaurants off the boardwalk in Venice, so make sure you make a reservation at High (rooftop bar) or the . It has panorama views of the beach and good food/drink. It's got heat lamps too, so whether it's a sunny day or you want to kick back at night...High is the place to be. Also, Barlo, the restaurant off the lobby, has a great breakfast. If you've never stayed at a Joie de Vivre hotel, it's worth checking one out. They all have charm, good quality of the rooms and great service.",
            "We stayed in the Dog Town Suite and it was amazing!!! Amazing view and great service!! High Bar was awesome. The service was great and they even had blankets for you if you got too cold! I an recommending this place to everyone I know! Can't beat the location of this hotel... Just steps from the beach.",
            "From the first moment we arrived to the moment we left, the staff made every effort to create a calm, welcoming atmosphere at Hotel Erwin. The Hash Restaurant and the High Lounge are a surprise of veritable delights making it difficult to choose in what to indulge.",
            "Great hotel. Great position on Venice, rooms are large and spacious, shower is excellent, beds are super comfortable and they have a nice feel to them generally. The staff are friendly and wonderful and nothing is too much trouble. Miguel, Eugene and Rich (the night mananger) are all very much integral to the experience, as they go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable. Indeed, I have had to deal with the General Manager Benjamin on another matter and he also is lovely and courteous. YOu are made to feel truly welcome. In my view, this is a vastly different experience to other hotels in the area. High, the rooftop bar at the Erwin (with tapas style food) is AWESOME, great view, fantastic Argentinian beef tacos (a must) and great ambience. I made the mistake of staying at the Bayside Hotel (what turned out to be a $150 a night fleabag motel) on a recent 3 day trip to LA, and in desperation called the Erwin and they squeezed me in at late notice and even called a cab to come and pick me up from the Bayside. Hotel Erwin - all the way.",
            "I really liked the Erwin. It's a well designed and clean hotel in the heart of Venice beach. Amazing views from the rooftop bar. I had a premier ocean view king on the top (6th) floor that's on the side of the building. The room itself was very spacious and had a comfortable bed. There is a small balcony, but there's only a small glass divider between your neighbor's balcony. Nice views though. I would advise against staying on the 6th floor if you are noise sensitive, as you can hear the music coming from the roof deck. It's actually amazing how well they've sound insulated the room, but you can still hear the muffled booming. The music stopped around 11pm so it didn't really bother me. All in all a good experience.",
            "Went to LA for business and stayed at the Hotel Erwin in Venice Beach for a change of pace from the hotels near the airport. Turned out to be a great move. The hotel was right near the beach so I was able to go for a run in a scenic setting as opposed to a fitness room on a treadmill. Internet service was satisfactory so I could get work done in my room which faced the ocean. Once work was done I would go to the rooftop bar for a beer to relax. You can't ask for a better \"business\" trip than that.",
            "This hotel lies right between a nice beachfront residentail neighbourhood to the south and an edgy stretch of boardwalk lined with cheap and colourful souvenir stores, drug paraphrenalia supply stores, local fast food eateries and a lively laid back (high?) entrpreneurial and perhaps talented transient group plying their craft/art/special skills, to the north! It is a fun must-see beach. Very different from Santa Monica Beach, Huntington, Laguna, Newport.... you name it, Venice Beach is special. The hotel staff told us the boardwalk was unsafe to walk on after dark. And judging by the daytime crowd, we can easily imagine why. However they neglected to tell us that the area to the south of the hotel is quite different. We almost missed a big part of Venice, complete with lagoons and beautiful (also reasonably priced) beachfront houses. One place rents for $2000US a month for tourists. That's amazing for L.A. The rooms are clean enough, and the staff attentive and courteous. Our partial oceanview room is precisely that - looking straight out, the view is the top of a warehouse type building; crank your neck to the left and you can barely make out the ocean and beach about half a block away. There was no balcony. If you have a car, remember to add the valet parking fee ($16 a day) into your hotel budget. Street parking is not recommended in that area. Also watch out for a \"donation\" for the homeless that they sneak in without asking first. We ended up making the donation, but still felt scammed because they didn't ask and put us on the spot when we reviewed the bill.",
            "I was excited to stay in my first Joie de Vivre Hotel, having heard about the boutique chain from family members. The Erwin Hotel was a great introduction to the JDV way, it's chic and stylish but still affordable. The location in Venice was hard to beat, 1 block from the boardwalk/beach and easy valet parking in a covered lot so you didn't have to worry about your car. The check in area was a little cramped, but the check-in process was very quick and soon we were up in our room. The room was fairly basic but it was roomy and had plenty of modern charm. The restaurant is cozy but they have good healthy food. One unexpected bonus was the sunglasses they had for sale in the room, we needed a pair so grabbed one and paid when we checked out. The rooftop bar is remarkable and the true highlight of the hotel. We went up on a weekday afternoon and there were only a couple other tables occupied so we more or less had it to ourselves. Unbeatable views of the coast. The one drawback of the rooftop bar, as other reviews have noted, is that if your room is near the elevator or stairway that gives access to it, it will be noisy during peak bar times (weekend nights). Overall a great value given the location and the modern design update they've given the hotel.",
            "After checking-in and entering our room - there was an overpowering odor of \"an illegal substance,\" even though this was supposed to be a non-smoking hotel! Immediately called down to the front desk and was moved to another room. Too bad that this was the first impression we received.",
            "I stayed here with my girlfriend last week and couldn't have been happier with the hotel. It is in an AMAZING location, just across from Venice Beach. It also sports outstandingly gorgeous views in all directions from the Rooftop bar, High. We had a clear day, by LA standards, and could see all the way to the Hollywood sign and up to Santa Monica. The High is incredible. The drinks were excellent and the food equally as impressive. We enjoyed breakfast the next morning and our food arrived on time and piping hot. The King size bed was so comfortable we didn't want to leave. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a night away from the busy hustle and bustle of LA. It is a sanctuary of relaxation amidst the concrete jungle.",
            "I stayed at Erwin for one Saturday night in August to celebrate with a group friends. We booked a large suite complete with partial kitchen, fireplace, kitchen table and sitting area separate from the small bedroom. The appointments and decor were great along with a nice touch of street art posters and murals throughout the room. The best touch was the Sam Flores bathroom door. The room was great, however, there were many touches throughout that needed a little rehab. I'm a chipped paint snob, so it is a bit of a turn off when you pay several hundred dollars and walk into a room that needs some repairs. i don't know why those details are so commonly overlooked by upscale hotels. The best part of the hotel is the 7th floor rooftop deck. Grab a corner couch at sunset and enjoy the boardwalk scene with a delicious cocktail. The food was not very good, so sip your drinks slowly and save your appetite for the restaurants on Abbott Kinney."

            "This was our first trip to Barcelona and the last leg of our Europe trip. My husband and I didn't have a large budget so we opted to stay outside of the main tourist area in order to get a better rate for our 4 night stay. This hotel is what I would say on the edge of the tourist area but still definitely in walking distance to all of the sightseeing. It is located about a 10 min walk to the main areas and about a 15-20 min walk down to Las Ramblas, etc. We even walked down to the beach, which wasn't bad at all! But we like to travel by foot to take in the culture. :) To get here we took the train and metro and it was very very easy and inexpensive. To leave we opted for the taxi service because our flight was at 6am. Both great options for to and from the airport. The front desk is very helpful and there 24/7. The rooms and lobby are very clean and modernly updated. The halls are very quiet, which is great for long days of being out and about. The hotel is very safe and there were absolutely no signs of theft. Our room itself was HUGE - king bed, couch, desk, big dressing area, huge bathroom. It was great for the last part of our trip! I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are look for a dependable less expensive place to stay.",
            "Recently renovated hotel. Well done. Good reception, atmosphere. Excellent, very friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast. Overall very positive impression. We had a triple room. Unfortunately the triple rooms face an internal courtyard which is covered. So no fresh air circulation. With all our systems off, we at one moment had an internal room temperature of 29 degrees. So, in the midst of winter, we switched on the Airco. Call me a complainer, but I do not like sleeping with Airco either. So, if you like to sleep in a warm room, do go there.",
            "Booked U232 Hotel as part of an Expedia air/hotel package not knowing what the hotel would be like. Had read the reviews which sounded good. Without reservation I can now highly recommend the U232. We had 3 rooms on the 2nd floor. Each room had a different layout but each one was finely appointed, exceptionally clean, with great storage for your bags, free wi fi, and one of the best bathrooms of all the hotels we stayed in over 14 days. The front staff were always extra friendly and helpful in recommending restaurants or places to visit. Bedding was comfortable as well. The hotel is located in an upscale neighborhood and within a very short walk of the nearest metro station. Rooms were quiet even from the hospital nearby never disturbing us with loud ambulance sirens or street noise. From our balcony we could view the nice college campus across the street. Would certainly stay here again.",
            "My wife and I stayed at the U232 for 5 nights while we were on holiday in Spain. Location - The hotel is located on the western perimeter of the Eixample district, very close to the Diagonal (a street that runs diagonally through Barcelona). The location, though not in the main tourist area, served us quite well during. The \"Hospital Clinic\" metro stop is about 100 meters from the hotel, so when we didn't want to walk somewhere, we were able to get around very easily. It wasn't always easy to find good restaurants in the area, however, so we ate elsewhere in the city on a couple of occasions. Room - Our room was very clean and a reasonable size. We certainly didn't feel that it was too small for our five-night stay. There was also ample room to put away our clothes for the duration of our stay. The washroom was nice despite a small amount of water vapor damage that was visible on the ceiling (I don't know why they don't use bathroom fans in Spain, but that would likely take care of the issue). The shower head produced an absolutely amazing \"rainfall\" shower. I had some trouble with the AC controls, it seemed that the choice was either on or off. Our room was in the back of the hotel and was very quiet. Service - The service from the hotel staff was good. They always had time to answer our questions or make recommendations. The hotel also provides its guests with free high-speed internet. Overall, we'd recommend the U232. We had booked this hotel well in advance and got a good early-booking rate for our room. Any rate you can get under 130 euros per night (breakfast not included) during the peak tourist season should be considered a bargain.",
            "Stayed at this hotel for 4 days with two other couples before taking cruise. Was very pleased with this hotel, it was better than expected for the price. Each of our rooms were different, all totally adequate, very clean and modern. Excellent air conditioning system and none of us heard a noise at night.Our room had two bathrooms which was completely unexpected, one with tub, 2nd with shower. Both completely done in tile and dark marble, really modern and chic. The front desk staff were all excellent and very helpful regarding sites, restaurants and general enquiries. Our room included breakfast buffet, we all enjoyed it daily, lots of selection and good quality of foods. Don't know if it would be worth the 14 euro if it wasn't included but it is definately a good addition when included. The front desk staff put us on to one nearby restaurant that we tried. It was called Maitea and is just two blocks away on Casanova Street, an easy 5 minute walk. We took the recomendation and tried the place about 9:00 PM one night. What a great place!!!! We all had a great time in the atmosphere. The owner, Nickolas was a great guy and very helpful. He spoke great English and we had a great meal with wines there. They specialize in Montaditos. These are small pices of breads with different toppings, some hot, some cold. All are unique and many were truly amazing.They keep coming with different plates and recipes of these and one can sample whatever you like. Very reasonably priced and a great local atmosphere may it a highlite for us as an eatery. The hotel staff have cards with directions if you're interested, ENJOY....... We all would definately return to this hotel and will recommend it to our friends who plan to travel to this great city..............",
            "Clean, modern, comfortable. Good location...easy to get on metro and just a couple stops to all tourist areas. Nice staff. Free internet. Great price and value!! Would definitely recommend to all and would stay again myself for sure. Loved it!! This was the first 3 days of a girls trip through Spain with friends, and this was our favorite hotel of the trip.",
            "I like the hotel, but you have to ask for a room with a window on the outside, otherwise you will be disapointed. But if you choose the hotel only for sleeping in a very clean and very nice room, you don't need for a window, chhose this hotel !",
            "After LONG flights from Seattle ~ we were immediately soothed by the friendly and helpful staff allowing us to store our luggage in a secure room so that we could get out for a walk-about to shake off our jet lag. We found every amenity to be 'spot-on' and the location just perfect for us. We enjoyed the buzzing activity from our balcony but our friends said their room facing the back was very quiet compared to ours. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with them again and recommend them to friends wanting an intimate, friendly hotel.",
            "We have just returned from the lovely U232 hotel in Barcelona after a four day break in this beautiful city.Ideally situated for the major sights and a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city.Whilst there we suffered an unfortunate experience while out one evening and the hotel staff, particularly Manuel pesich,went out of their way to help us.Their kindness and understanding is something we will never forget.We would recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to return one day soon.",
            "This hotel may be a little out of the way but it is still close to everything. Our room was amazing, especially for the price. It had a wonderful bar which was appreciated after a hot and busy day sightseeing. Would definitely recommend thi shotle.",
            "The hotel was a great value. It was well located, a few minutes walk to the diagonal. The hotel rooms were clean, not too small, beds were comfortable, nice bathroom. The hotel was lobby was modern in design. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The staff added to the entire great experience we had staying at the hotel. Parking is conveniently located next to the hotel, and the hotel offers a discount on the parking fees. Many nice options for all dining experiences within easy walking distance. I would stay here again.",
            "Pretty good location, just slightly out of the centre. Which, actually is quite handy as a lot of Barcelonas tourist locations are spread out to all parts of the city and this hotel has a metro stop pretty near by. I've stayed here on more than a few occasions now and have always taken the 'top rooms' (as they are referred to by the hotel). They have beautiful terraces and the most amazing enormous 'roman style' marble baths. (absolutely perfect for romance etc...). Apart from these rooms, the hotel is typical of Barcelona. Breakfast is NOT included, despite the exorbitant price and the service is adequate.",
            "We love this hotel! When we were deciding where to stay, we thought U232 might be a bit too far away from everything we wanted to see (we are very active sight seers!!!). Don't let this be a factor because the hotel is in a perfect location! It's in a quiet area, but with very easy access to all parts of town due to close proximity to the subway (very safe). My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights after ending a 12 day cruise. Our first visit to Barcelona. Friends had stayed here and they highly recommended it. We are so happy we listened to them! Our room (#908) was large, very modern, clean and just lovely. Great air conditioning system. The large bathroom was done in beautiful black marble, and had a huge tub next to windows that opened onto a very large private balcony (of course, you could also access the balcony from the sliding glass window in the bedroom!). The staff was outstanding! Very helpful in explaining how to get to places and tips on what to do and best times to do it. And they helped us get the 3:00 a.m. taxi ride to the airport! Good computers/printers downstairs that guests may use for free. We will be going back to Barcelona, and will again stay at Hotel U232.",
            "We liked this, small, modern hotel very much. The desk staff was great, spoke english well, very helpful with directions and suggestions. Our room was spotless and comfortable,, although it looked out only onto an air shaft (no view, but very quiet). We didn't get the breakfast, but the lobby bar was very nice. Separate room with two free internet terminals and printer was great.",
            "We stayed for one night as apart of a stop over in Barcelona. Its about a 20min walk from the city centre but very near to the Hospital metro station from which is fast to get anywhere. We parked in the public carpark under the hotel that was about EUR 20 for 24 hours after a hotel discount. The hotel is quite modern and well decorated in dark wood. Our room was a standard one but was well decorated a of a good size and had a nice bathroom. Everything was very clean. We did not have breakfast as our rate did not include it and it was quite expensive but there are a number of local cafes and coffee shops so getting breakfast and lunch was no problem. The area felt safe. I would be happy to stay again on my next visit. It was a very peaceful experience compared to the crowded city.",
            "i stayed here for just one night to see FC Barcelona with my 6 yr old son. The hotel is a short walk to the metro stop, by short i mean less than a minute !! Staff here (2 ladies on the daytime shift) were absolutely superb and so helpful. The room was nice and there is an excellent toiletries/ grooming kit provided so you need nothing - not even a toothbrush !! The only negative point i can say is that i had a room facing inward so there was little natural light. Beds were soft and comfy - overall a very pleasant stay for less that \u00a365 ! !",
            "We recently stayed in this hotel in Barcelona, based on the Tripadvisor reviews we thought it would be fantastic and i have to admit we were very dissappointed. The staff we found were quite cold and non welcoming. In terms of the hotel, yes it is a business hotel and therefore lacked in terms of facilities if your trip is for leisure, there is no area to relax in the sun or terrace area, even the balconies didn't have chairs. Beware also breakfast is \u20ac27 for two people and a whiskey and coke at the bar \u20ac12, so this hotel is very over priced. Down the street we found a little cafe where a beer was \u20ac1.90 to put things in context. Oh and the bar shuts at 11pm - even for residents The hotel is a good 25 minute walk into Las Ramblas although the metro is fantastic if you don't mind getting two trains, however if you want to be in the centre of things, this hotel is far. On the positive side the beds were very comfortable and the hotel is quiet. wish we had more good things to say as we usually book on the advice from tripadvisor, but not this time",
            "I stayed in this hotel for 6 night at the beginning of august, one day i did find a bed bug crawling in between the 2 single beds... i didnt know what it was at the time, when i came back home i woke up with at least 100 bites all over my body... i went to the hopsital and the doctor told me that i have been beaten by bed bugs.... i had to stay at the hospital for some injection... and i am totally traumatised..... so obviously i will never go back to this hotel. I have just called the hotel and they just told me \"thanks for acalling\" thats it.... i am sorry but this is not enough..... i am very upset and disapointed....",
            "My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel 5 nights and we really had a pleasant time! The hotel itself looks really nice and comfortable. The room was really nice decorated, but maybe a little bit too dark for my taste. The bathroom has a little rain shower and provide you with all the amenities you need. The staff was friendly and helpfull. The bar is nice, but really expensive. The location was good too. In walking distance are a lot of restaurants, bars and clubs. The subway - which will bring you to the centre, the harbor etc. - is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. A cab ride to the airport will cost you about \u20ac 40,-.",
            "The hotel isnt in the heart of the main touristy areas, but in a nice quiet part of Barcelona - within walking distance of everything - an easy 5-10 minute walk to the main road where the \"hop-on\" tours stops and a short distance from bus # 59. The decor is contemporary with dark colors, cocktail bar in the front entrance. Easy jazz music playing softly throughout. Super fast free internet with a printer. Rooms were very modern. The place was immaculately clean. The staff were very pleasant, extremely friendly and obliging, helpful with directions, recommendations and other needs. Multilingual so I did not have to embarrass myself trying to speak Spanish. Restaurants, shops, cafes and supermarkets all nearby. From the service, to the room to the location, I could not fault the U232. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.",
            "We slept one night for business. The hotel has a nice trendy moderne atmosphere that is very cosy ( wood, dark colors on the walls). Room very nice with flat screen, great bedding, free internet ( VPN not compatible) Price was 110\u20ac including breakfast ( fresh orange juice) Minibar filled and not too expensive. Location is maybe not the best, but still in a busy area with good restaurants around Would go back - definitively",
            "My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in September. This hotel is less expensive than most since its in a quiter part of the city. Although its only a 10-20 min walk to most sites. The staff is helpful and the rooms are clean. The bathroom was excellent and appears to have been recently renovated. There is free WIFI. We didn't pay extra for the breakfast but there are plenty of places to eat in the area. Overall we would recommend saving your money by staying at the U232 rather than pay extra just to be a liitle closer to the city center (Barcelona is an easy city to walk around).",
            "This is a wonderful NN hotel which provides great value for the price. We were able to stay in one of the rooms on the top floor which was amazing. There is a large king size bed with a HUGE washroom complete with a jetted tub and two rain showers. The room also has a large patio with a table for dining and lounging. The only downside to this hotel is the location. Although it is still quite central, it is a little bit out of the way. This is easily overlooked though if you can get one of those top rooms.",
            "you have a separate room for your loggage and clothes. good location for shopping.dont waste time for shoping in the city center. close to the hotel there is a big shopping mall and so you can find many other shop in same street. car parking is not free and there is not any elevator from parking to the hotel",
            "hotel is located in very nice area. Not crowded, but 1 minute from metro station L5 and about 15 minutes from La Rambla street. Very friendly staff, good service, rooms exactly as on pictures. Reasonable price. Breakfast is impressive. Good choice of dishes in nice decorated place. Highly recommended. Free internet access.",
            "The hotel is very nice and well placed in the center of the city but the triple rooms have no view, are very cleistofobic and the price is very high for such a case.When we booked the room (by web bookiing) there was no indication that triple rooms are only interior ones.",
            "We spent two days in Barcelona and wanted a hotel near the hop- hop-off Bus Touristic. The hotel is a short walk from stops for both bus routes and close to the metro, very convenient and very comfortable. It is not in a tourist area and so we got a better price and a nicer room for our money. The hotel helped make our too brief visit a pleasure.",
            "We seem to have different priorities than many visitors to Barcelona -- we explicitly wanted to stay in the Eixample, and be near to the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia. We were following the Ruta del Modernisme guide book, and were interested primarily in the works of Gaudi, Domenech i Montaner, and Puig i Cadafalch. However, if you're looking to spend time in the Barri Gothic or visit the waterfront, expect a 12 euro cab ride. The metro, however, is right around the corner and easily accessible. We did not have the breakfast, although there are at least 6 bakeries within a block of the hotel, so if it's unappealing to you, many things around the area should suit better. The gentleman working reception when we arrived was a bit reticent and uncongenial, and after quite a bit of travel, this was unfortunate. For instance, one of our keys didn't work in the door, and we didn't discover until two days later that it had been coded for a different room. Once we were able to enter, however, we were unable to turn on any lights. If it's common to have to use one's room key to turn on the lights in hotels, I have somehow yet to have encountered it, and it would have been nice had the gentleman at reception told us about this detail. So, if you stay at this hotel: your room key turns on the lights, and it must remain in the light lock for the entire time you expect the lights to be operational. However, the woman at the desk in the evening was friendly and helpful, and even helped us a bit with both Spanish and Catalan pronunciation. The woman tending the bar is certainly at home in the chic design boutique hotel environment, and mixes excellent drinks. And when my husband fell under the weather with allergies (which are apparently uncommon in Barcelona), she was sympathetic, and helpfully attempted hot-toddies to soothe his throat, though she was unfamiliar with the practice.",
            "We loved u232. From the very start till we left the staff could not have been more polite and helpful. The welcome drink was our best cocktail in Spain in their very chic little bar. The rooms were so comfortable, the breakfast was tasty and fresh, and the location was brilliant if you don't mind using the metro. We did walk to the wharf on the first day but after that used the nearby subway for easy access to everything Barcelona. We loved our dinner at local pizza restaurant and went to a tourist flamenco performance which was good fun and not too expensive for the show and a simple meal for 25\u20ac. Best was wandering the streets and being gobsmacked by the incredible buildings. Of courseLa Segrada Familia was mind blowing and well worth the entry fee.",
            "Excellent place to stay on a lovely trip to Barcelona. Rate didn't include breakfast and we didn't really speak to the staff so can't comment on this but everything else was excellent. Gusto's by the metro is a great place for a pizza, eat in or out.",
            "First Impression: verry Nice. We travelled to Barcelona for Vacation. For us as Students a verry nice designed Hotel. The staff was verry helpfull. They try to arrange everything or you of you want. We did not use any meals. Supermarket is arround the Corner. Nice Central location. Metro 1 bloc away, Sagrada 20min walk. Free use of 2 computers in lobby with connection to internet and possibility to Print",
            "We stayed at the U232 prior to a Mediterranean Cruise. We spent two nights in the hotel. It was extremely clean and the staff was very helpful. We were greated by Manuel and he made must feel very welcome. The staff that we came in contact with spoke very good English. The room was very nice and the bed was very comfortable. We felt that it was good value for your money. If you are a traveller from North America, I would recommend that you pack a couple of facecloths because they are not available in many European hotels - that is the case in this hotel. We did not find any really good restaurants in the immediate area but just around the corner there is a grocery store where you can pick up a lot of snack foods at a reasonable price. We returned to the hotel for one night prior to our return flight to Canada and had another nice room. It faced the main street so it was not quite as quiet as our first room that faced a courtyard. both rooms were a nice size and bright. Ferran was very helpful in assisting us to confirm our flights home when we were not able to access the sites on the computer. All in all, we were very pleased with the personnel and the rooms.",
            "U232 is classy, clean, and centrally located. It is very stylish, yet completely affordable. The room I was in might have been TOO comfortable. The beds were amazing and every day I woke up to the sun shining in through the door to our balcony, which overlooked the beautiful tree-lined street. The staff is very nice and friendly, and the little bar is a nice touch. My friend and I would grab a drink and olives at the hotel before heading out at night. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby, and you can walk to some of the main attractions in Barcelona. Additionally, the metro is about a two minute walk from the hotel. I would definitely stay here again.",
            "lovely helpful staff and a great breakfast at a reasonable price - a boutique - ish feel , well appointed rooms with huge beds and lovely bathroom. The bar is small and friendly and not intimidating to sit and wait alone in - and the reception staff are very obliging, Clean, freshly done up and classy - recommended",
            "I would stay here again. It is in a great location for a great price and very clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is free wifi. The bar is nice, and on the second floor there is a cute lounge area as well. Yes, the furniture is somewhat cheap, but modern decor at an affordable price is going to mean cheap Ikea-style furniture. The only real downsides were that the shower and sink were very slow to drain and the shower head was so strange it was hard to actually get the water on your body instead of hitting the front wall of the shower. Otherwise, this was a great hotel. There is a nice closet and ample drawer space, and also a desk and side chair. It's not a big room, but if you're in Barcelona staying in your room then you should go home anyway! If you stay here, you MUST go to Maitea for tapas! It's only two blocks away and AWESOME!",
            "U232 is in a residential area of Barcelona. There are good cafes nearby for lunch and breakfast & I don't think breakfast is of good value in U232 (14 euros per person). Hotel rooms were good, bathrooms were very nice. No tea & coffee making facility and there is no provision of kettle, etc. Reception staff was brilliant. Hotel is well connected with public transport therefore you can go out late in the night. Would stay again!",
            "We stayed at Hotel U232 for three nights in July. I had been a little concerned about the hotel being located away from many of the tourist sites but the hotel\u2019s close proximity to the Hospital Clinic Metro stop really makes it a non-issue. We checked in very late in the evening as our train from Pamplona did not arrive until close to 10pm. The gentleman at reception gave us a few restaurant recommendations for restos close to the hotel (there are many). The one thing I appreciated the most from check-in was being told how to get in contact with the front desk (dial 55). At both of our hotels in Madrid and Pamplona, no instructions were given for dialing the front desk and it was difficult trying to figure it out. The room d\u00e9cor was everything it appeared to be online. The bathroom had a little wear and tear but there was ample room for toiletries around the sink. Unfortunately, we were not able to access the free wifi from our room (#405). There is a business center downstairs with two computers and one printer, which would come in handy if you wanted to print out your boarding passes. I would not hesitate to recommend Hotel U232 to friends and I would absolutely stay here again.",
            "We stayed for 5 nights taking into account the Spanish workers strike last month and had a great time there. U232 is a great little boutique hotel with excellent service and the quality of furnishings and detail is extremely good for the price. If you're looking for a more personal service than the larger chains in the city, then this hotel is defintely worth a look. I'd advise to ask in advance to get a room overlooking the comte d'urgell rather than the dark courtyard. Guests ranged from business types to affluent Americans, so peace and quiet is pretty much guaranteed. Location is absolutely fine as its only a 20 min stroll to Las Ramblas - and who'd want to be too close to the equivalent of Leicester Square anyway?! The Eixample district is clearly affluent with many cafes, bars and restaurants nearby so take a good look around. All the staff are very helpful and speak excellent English if your Spanish is a bit ropey. The only thing it lacked was an iPod docking station in the rooms, nothing more. If you want a quality hotel in Barcelona, but don't want to break the bank then book into U232. Highly recommended.",
            "Stayed here last month dor 3 days as I was inBarcelona for a business trip.My room was nice bit dark as it was on th backside therefore it was very quite though.I used some room service reasonaly priced and fast delivery.Reception was the ladies were very kind the guy could was ok. Location is great very close to the metro because of that to all the sites in Barcelona. Would stay again here.",
            "Just returned from a 3 night stay at the U232 and it was wonderful, nothing to fault at all. The hotel is exactly as the website photos show. The lobby area is lovely and relaxing, especially with the ambient music playing. The decor is very clean cut and contemporary and the hotel was only refurbished last year so still has that new smell about it! The staff are very helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious, spotless and you're guaranteed a good nights sleep in the huge comfy beds. Great location and close to the metro station. Check out an amazing tapas bar in walking distance called Cerveseria Catalonia for the best tapas in town. We had 3 glasses of red wine, 5 beers and all the tapas we could fit into 2.5 hours which cost around 50 euros, a bargain for the quality of the food. An excellent hotel, I would definitley go back.",
            "i have just return from a 4 days trip to Barcelona and i was looking forward to write this review. I booked this hotel based on the reviews i have read and because it wasn't in the center of the city near to touristic areas and to be honest the hotel was the best choice of this trip. It is in a quiet area, near the metro station, a few good restaurants and bars are in the area where you can find only spanish people and not tourists. The staff can make you any resrvation for a restaurant or help you accordingly. The first impression when i arrived it was a cosy entrance and friendly staff (well done Manuel) the room was OK for single use (comfortable bed and pillows - clean - mini bar - big flat TV) and it was really quiet even it was near the elevator. The bathroom was clean and it had everything you may needed (the only thing missing in order to make it perfect was a pair of slippers), the shower was big and in marble. The breakfast was excellent, fresh fruits, a lot of choices and traditional mediterranean breakfast. The staff was also very helpful and kind. In the hotel there is free wi-fi connection so you can be online most of the time. if you decided to book a room there, note that you can negociate for the price. I made the reservation on November and when i contacted them by email, they gave me -10% on the internet rate + -10% for early booking. Certainly i return back in U232 for a 2nd visit!",
            "Stayed here for 5 nights and the room is great with two twin beds and two bathrooms, truly a luxury for how much we pay for. One downside is the room has a window facing inside and is dark in the morning that didn't bother us. It is very closed to Metro and great cafe for a quick breakfast. The receptionists are very friendly and knowledgeable. We will come back again and stay here.",
            "We enjoyed the peace and quiet of this hotel. Free internet/computer in their small business center. Requested and received very quiet room facing back. No view, but, more importantly, no noise. Attractive, very clean, smart looking. Hotel stored our luggage for a day before we officially checked-in. Located a bit too far from Las Ramblas to make the walk all of the time, but metro is a block away; most often it required a connection to our destination. About 1.5 blocks to food market, smaller version of La Boqueria. Definitely recommend if you don't mind being a tad away from the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas. For us, that was a plus.",
            "U232 doesn't look like much from the outside, but the unassuming exterior belies an absolutely polished, well-kept interior. We had a room with a small balcony onto the main street (Comte Urgell), but the glass door was remarkably soundproof. That combined with the blackout curtains made for very restful sleep. The room was very, very small, but tastefully appointed and didn't actually feel very cramped. The only thing that was a little strange was the shower. All black marble, which is very nice, but there's no light inside the shower, and there is this funny little window that opens into nothingness (an alternate universe? the twilight zone? some kind of ventilation shaft?). It would be nice if there was a bit more light in the shower, but other than that, a very nice (but tiny) bathroom. This hotel could be improved by offering a free breakfast. We decided to not pay the ~14 euro each day for the breakfast buffet, which looked decent, but not remarkable. Other hotels of this standard that we've stayed out throughout europe offer rooms for a similar price, but include breakfast. This seems like an easy thing U232 could do to improve its attractiveness to all travelers. Finally, it's in a great neighbourhood- slightly out of the main downtown bustle, but with LOTS of amazing restaurant options nearby (though look those up in a guidebook - the ones the front desk suggested were rather underwhelming - the ones suggested in the Time Out guide were especially great).",
            "we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights if you want a room away from the road then ask to be on the back of the hotel very very quiet ,very helpful and speedy at reception, a 5 min walk from the metro station and a 15 min walk from the aerobus which costs about 5euros each to and from the airport or 25 to 30 euros in a taxi, we didnt eat at the hotel for breakfast turn right outside the hotel and 2 doors away is pans (a bit like subway) they sell bagettes for 3.50 euros and you can sit outside in the sun, we didnt walk to las ramblas but i should think its quite a distance on foot ,well situated for the metro to fc barcelona ,would definatly stay again",
            "We were a bit worried about the distance of this hotel from the main tourist areas, but this turned out to be a blessing as we really enjoyed the neighborhood and the hotel itself was top-notch. Our room was on the 2nd floor and faced the back so we didn't have a view - but we did get an extra big balcony. Curiously, there was no patio furniture, so there was no way to really enjoy it other than lean out. This is a very design-y hotel with really nice furniture by Zanotta, Artemide, etc. There's a bar downstairs and a breakfast restaurant (though we opted for neighborhood cafe's instead). If you are taking the metro from the airport, the light blue line actually takes you to the nearest stop (Hospital Clinic). This same line takes you directly to the Sagrada Familia. All other sites are 2-3 transfers away. Friendly staff and great amenities as well (love the heated towel rack and box of personal grooming kit you get upon check-in.)",
            "We booked a \"Top\" room at the U232 (as part of a trip celebrating our wedding anniversary) based on the photos displayed on the hotel website. We expected our room to have a shaded terrace with cushioned chaise lounges as displayed in the advertising for this type of room. While we were given a room on the upper floor, our terrace was open to the elements and was furnished with two canvas deck chairs and did not even offer an umbrella for shade. The temperature was in the 85 - 90 degree range and the terrace was so hot we could not use it at all. We asked to be relocated but were told it was not possible. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, the location was quiet yet accessible to all tourist sites and the metro, and the breakfast was very nice. However we were very disappointed that our TOP room was not what was advertised and not what we expected despite paying the higher rate.",
            "Good, clean, comfortable hotel away from La Rambla. Only a five minute bus ride into the busy Barcelona city. Close to some really lovely restaurants/ tapas bars etc. Staff were really helpful and friendly. Our room was upgraded so we ended up with a suite which was just what we needed after three weeks travelling by car around Italy and France. Breakfast buffet had a wide selection to suite all the different types of international travellers.",
            "I stayed at the U232 for a trip with my friend ,arrived early and got allocated our room straight away.room was lovely with everything you would need,all toiletries and proper hair dryer.we booked for b&b and the breakfast was great .everything you want to set you up for a day of sight seeing.staff were very friendly and spoke good english, and hotel had a nice relaxed and safe atmosphere to it.would definately stay again.",
            "When traveling to Barcelona, we were expecting a pint sized hotel room because thats what you typically experience throughout Europe. When we arrived at U232 we are pleasantly surprised and the size, decor and cleanliness of the room. Had a large King Bed, large bathroom with all the amenities, Ikea-esque decor, flat panel television and tons of storage for baggage. To top it off they have a free business center with computers and printers. The staff was also extremely helpful, they spoke english (which is pretty hard to find in Barcelona) so they made numerous phone calls for us (ordered us pizza, called the post office for shipping, etc). It was close enough to the shopping line and Las Ramblas to walk and had a great little cafe kitty-corner from it for coffee or pastries. We loved this place and would definitely stay again if we went back to Barcelona! !",
            "We had a wonderful experience at U232. The front desk staff, especially Laia, were great. The room was wonderfully designed, comfortable, and spacious. We were only a block and a half from a metro stop. The only slight concern is that it's not located in the city center, but with the metro so close, it's easy to get around.",
            "The U232 was modern, clean, and comfortable, although the rooms were small by American standards. The free Wi-Fi was spotty, and the shower temperature was tempermental. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. Look for special rates that include the breakfast! It's close to the Metro, but nothing else! If you want to go to Placa Catalunya, it is quite a trip. Recommend taking the (cheap!) taxis if you are in a group. We didn't find many places to eat, shop, or sightsee within walking distance.",
            "Lovely rooms, great location but the staff was a bit unflexible as we had to check out at 12.00h not even 3 minutes later (the hotel hall was empty so no big group waiting for rooms to be cleaned). I wasn't asking for an hour extra but a few minutes to finish packing.",
            "Everything you want from a hotel stay. The room cannot be faulted, with a spacious terrace, super comfy bed and the best hotel bathroom (two rain-showers and bath) and stylish decor. Our favorite part was the excellent service. No sucking up or insincere 'hospitality' just good old honest professionalism and friendly personalities. Absolutely worth every cent.",
            "Great hotel room spec - very friendly welcome from staff who are not only helpful but knowledgable about the area and amenities.We stayed for 3 nights in a U232 room with an enormous super king size bed and private terrace. Quiet outlook at the rear of the hotel away from the main road. Breakfast was plentiful and varied catering for most needs. Unable to fault anything about the hotel and the service we received and highly recommend a stay here.",
            "Great hotel , very close to metro or only 10-15 mins walk away to main tourist areas. Rooms were of good quality and very clean. Service was excellent with friendly helpful staff. In business area but did have a few good restaurants nearby with lots of cafes for breakfast. Pleasant bar in hotel for early evening beer. Didn't eat in hotel so can't comment on food. Rooms were quiet so had good nights sleep. Definitely recommend especially when rates were so good.",
            "We stayed two nights before and two nights after a Royal Caribbean cruise. Being centrally located it allowed us to walk to many places; public systems within a few blocks. The hotel is relatively small, recently updated with adequately sized rooms (very nice bathroom), efficient personnel. Bar is excellent, Breakfast a bit pricey at 13 Euros but good. A number of small resturants are nearby.",
            "We stayed here during peak season, and at under 200 quid for 4 nights the price is fantastic for central Barcelona. Anywhere nearer to La Ramblas at that time of year costs an arm and a leg! It's a short walk to the tube station, a couple of stops and you are at La Ramblas. Tubes run til quite late, but after that taxis back to the hotel are reasonable. The room was nice - nice bed, good size bathroom and mini bar restocked every day (drinks not included) . Would definately stay here again next time.",
            "I really enjoyed staying in the U232 hotel. It was modern and cean. The staff were very helpful and the rooms were a good size and nicely decorated with black beams on the ceiling and a well equipped black marble bathroom (once you work out how to use the shower controls - one for water and one for temperature, not hot and cold like I first thought - but that could just be me being useless). I have stayed in Barcelona many times in the past and normally stayed down near the port or the Ramblas however this hotel was slightly out of the 'tourist' centre which I really enjoyed. There are some really nice bars and restaurants near by (my favourite was Maitea Taberna, it is a must if you are staying in this hotel, only 2 minutes walk and great food. Read the reviews on this site). Although I did walk to the Ramblas from the hotel one day I would probably recomend the metro if you want to get about without blisters. There is a stop only one minutes walk from the hotel (called Hospital Clinic) which will give you quick access to the whole city. Travel Tip: I would definitely recommend getting a T-10 ticket for the metro, it saves you a lot of money and makes travel so easy. As the name would suggest you get ten trips on bus or metro and can be used by more than one person (just leave it on the top of the barrier for your friend to use behind you). Every time you use the ticket it tells you on the display how many trips you still have left...",
            "I loved the 232. A very stylish, boutique hotel without the stylish boutique hotel prices! We paid around \u00a370 bed and breakfast per night. The hotel is in the Eixample area of the city, a bit quieter than the hussle and bussle of the tourist area but still only 20 minutes walk from the Ramblas or 2 minutes on the metro which is only 2 minutes walk from the hotel (Hospital Clinic station). The hotel provides great breakfast (cooked and continental), a great gym and a superb roof terrace. There's a bar on the ground floor serving drinks and snacks. There's a good selection of local bars and restaurants in the surrounding area. The staff are friendly, the decor is wonderful. I'll stay here again.",
            "We stayed here for the second half of a 10 day trip to Lisbon-Barcelona last Autumn. The weather was great and so was U232! Although our particular room was a bit small, with no view to speak of, the beds were very comfortable, the air conditioning was good and the bathroom very clean and modern. The front desk staff were lively, comical and very helpful, and the female bartender made hefty drinks.The location is great, a block from the Metro, in a nice neighborhood, and you could be in the Ramblas in 20 minutes walking. We walked to la Sagrada Familia, etc. and there are nice restaurants in the area of the hotel, there was one 'inoteca that is a wine store in the front and a large restaurant in the back with very tasty food. Ask them at the front desk about it. If you're there for several days, don't miss the chance to go to the picturesque nearby seaside town of Sitges, only an inexpensive 30 minute train ride from the Central Railway Station. When in the Ramblas, don't miss the Plaza Garibaldi, a very beautiful palm lined courtyard and fountain which is great for taking photos.",
            "Very pleased with our recent stay. The staff were helpful and courteous (someone had obviously been smoking in our non-smoking room and they quickly arranged for another; we later saw that they were airing out the first room) and the location was safe, centrally located, and near good restaurants. Our room was very quiet, clean, and tastefully decorated with a decent bed/mattress and a terrific bathroom. Very good value. There are plenty of cafes nearby, so that you can skip the 14 Euro buffet breakfast.",
            "I took my husband here for a surprise trip for his 30th birthday. The rooms were a really good size, they were stylishly decorated with excellent showers and really comfortably beds. It felt like the place had only recently been refurbished but I don't think it had. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful, recommending some excellent places to eat and visit. The only slight negative would be that this is about a half hour walk from a lot of the central touristy places but to be honest that was a bonus for us as it was nice and quiet in the evenings.",
            "We reserved two rooms because we were traveling with our college aged children. The wifi connection was great so our kids were fully entertained. We reserved one of the hotel's \"top\" rooms which had a shower which didn't work properly. The hotel could not get it fixed over the Easter weekend and moved us to a beautiful room with a good view and plenty of room. The staff was helpful, and the hotel has an attractive bar area for grabbing a drink before or after dinner. Very good restaurants in the area, including 2 by a restaurant owner with a last name of \"Olive.\" The staff will be able to direct you. It was so crowded in city center that being a metro ride away was a pleasure. Would return to the hotel.",
            "We were looking for a hotel away from the tourist areas but still very accessible to the sites of the city. U232 was perfect for us. The Metro was very close and we were within walking distance to wonderful neighborhoods. The rooms were small but very well appointed and comfortable. The staff was terrific and went out of their way to help us enjoy the stay. Each afternoon we really enjoyed getting a bottle of wine and heading up to the rooftop terrace.",
            "The U232 is a lovely, clean and convenient hotel. My wife and I would certainly stay there again. The staff was friendly and helpful. Georgina was especially awesome. She always greeted us with a smile and her English was fantastic. The location was adequate. The hotel lies 1.5 blocks friom the metro. My wife and I thought we would walk every where and would have little need of the metro. we were wrong. Still walked a ton but the metro is an absolute necessity. it is cean, fast and on time. The T-10 card is a must. The room was smallish but it served our needs as we really only slept there. The bathroom/shower was fine. Really no complaints at all. Cafe el fornet is just across the street. We ate breakfast there every day, usually <10 euros. We did not eat or drink anything at the hotel so can't comment on that. there are several small grocery stores and a large Dept store well within walking distance. the dept store (on Av Diagonal) has a large grocery store. Tip: Had wallet stolen while getting on the metro at 3 PM returning from Parc Guell (Lesseps). Three A-holes surrounded me as I was getting on the metro (one in front blocking my way, one on my side and one behind). It happened very quickly (seconds). I recognized what happened immediately(as this scenario was described elsewhere) but they timed it perfectly an jumped off the metro just as the door were closing. I had my wallet in a bottoned pocket (cargo shorts) but that did not help. USE A HIDDEN MONEY BELT AND TAKE ONLY THE CASH THAT YOU NEED. Be careful, this happened at 3 in the afternoon not at night. otherwise, we felt safe and never had a problem. Have fun. Would go back to Barcelona and U232 in a heart beat.",
            "We went to Barcelona for a weekend and chose the U232 as it was not too expensive but still in a nice area. The hotel is 5 minutes walk fom the metro (Hospital Clinic) and you can be in the heart of Barcelona in less than 10 minutes. The room was clean and stylish, it was a good size with a huge and suprisingly comfortable double bed. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as it was an extra \u20ac14 each per day. There are a couple of cafes towards the metro stop and we got good breakfasts for less that for both of us. The only other negative thing was that the bathroom towels were really hard, not just a bit short of fabric softener but like nearly doormat level. Still, the staff were pleasant and we left quite happy. I would go back.",
            "I only decided to write this review to point out that if you need to iron your clothes, you can't have an iron or ironing board brought to your room. You need to use their ironing service. Hence my 2 star rating for service. Otherwise, the hotel is very stylish, modern and clean. And the staff speak impressive English and are friendly.",
            "This really is an excellent hotel. Well run, with efficient staff. Quiet rooms in back, nice breakfast room. However, the location is quite far from Gothic Quarter and major sites, and the tour bus does not stop near here. There is metro line 1.5 blocks away, but it does not go anywhere you would want to go, and you have to transfer, with long walks between lines. It is about 6 long blocks to other more convenient metro- and if it is hot in summer, you will not have pleasant walk. For solo travellers, consider a better location, especially for returning at night. The neighborhood itself is pleasant and has many restaurants, but you will not have convenient access to touring.",
            "Arrived at the hotel after just being robbed in Barcelona. Was about 2 minutes away by car when I got a flat tyre at a traffic light. When changing the tyre, somone stole my wife's handbag and made off as a pillion passenger on a scooter (someone who was pretending to help). Later found that this is a common scam, an organised group slashes your tyre and waits for you to stop. Then someone else diverts your attention (the guy on the scooter) while someone else steals your bags etc. Anyway, on to the U232 Hotel.... On checkin, the guy was sympathetic and immediately said he would upgrade my room. Got a fantastic room on the 9th floor with a huge balcony with dining table and sofa. Bathroom had a huge marble bath around 6 feet long with patio doors which opened directly to the balcony. Bedroom was absolute luxury and after the ordeal when we arrived, we felt like staying in the hotel room all night but decided to venture out regardless. At reception, we were given vouchers for a free coctail at the bar. The hotel itself was very luxurious, very well presented. The public toilet was spotless with fresh linen for drying your hands. Also had an internet room with free access on 2 PC's. We didn't eat in the hotel but did notice prices were reasonable for a city location. Basically, the hotel staff and the hoitel ambience made up for what could have been a disasterous trip to Barcelona. p.s. I did get my wifes bag back after I chased after the culprit and pulled him off the bike...",
            "When searching hotels for a two night weekend stay (ex cruise) we did not feel the prices in the city center (Rambles area) represented value in any form when averaged at \u00a3200 per night (double). This location -only a short walk to the Metro station - with a choice of at least three breakfast eateries on the way with endless selections to eat for a few euros - getting into the centre in 15 minutes meant we saved a small fortune. Our room was a good size with large bathroom and all cons necessary. A very comfortable bed and all very clean & I am quiet particular in this area! Any questions at the desk were politely & informatively answered with a smile and maps to help on our first visit to the city. All in all apart from the breakfast cost which we declined as not value which was a good decision as explained above - we feel this hotel deserves the acclaims given by fellow travelers reporting on this site.",
            "Excellent, stylish hotel, staffed by very friendly and helpful professionals. The rooms are modern and well appointed, with a good sized bathroom. Lots of cafes and restaurants within 5 minutes walking distance of the hotel, and the main city attractions are accessible within 20 minutes walk or via the metro system just a few minutes walk from the hotel. Highly recommended.",
            "Far enough away from the busy centre but conveniently placed by the metro and within easy walking distance of Las Ramblas. All staff were friendly and helpful, particularly Fernanda who was in charge of reception during our visit, and who responded very helpfully to our e mails before our stay. Our room was of a good size and very comfortable. We will happily stay again.. Kevin Hurst",
            "We stayed at this hotel on our trip to Barcelona for our 1st anniversary. Small but stylish room with a balcony and the hotel was only a block or so from the metro. And everything we did was within 4 metro stops so while not located in the city center the hotel is definitely in a great spot. The neighborhood was wonderful -- there were cafes, bars and excellent restaurants all within walking distance. The staff was nice and generally helpful but they did forget to give us our wake-up call on the day we left. That was the only negative of the hotel. I would definitely stay there and recommend it to others.",
            "I booked this hotel for both a before and after cruise stay for a group of older adults and paid the sizable 20% non-refundable deposit. I did read the location statement on the company website which states that it is in a quiet residential neighborhood home to some of Gaud\u00ed\u2019s most famous works\u201d. After adding a former stroke victim to my group, I decided to do some more research. I did a google street view of the hotel address and found the area did not look residential at all. Further research indicated that to get to Barcelona City Center was more than most older adults in my group could handle. It involved walking 100 meters (more than three football fields) to the subway and a two subway ride (1 transfer). By now I was skeptical about the safety of the walk to the subway and decided to move my large group to a sister-hotel of this company. I knew I was in for complaints from my group about the location of this hotel. Hotel U232 not only would not transfer my deposit to their sister hotel, but when I wrote them and requested a refund, they responded by billing me for 4 euro cents.",
            "I just spent another few days in BCN and stayed (for the 3rd time) in U232. The hotel is amazing! Very cosy and elegant. Very nice lobby bar and friendly staff. One of the hotels I want to go back and back again. Just feeling on the right place there. Room 711 features a great balcony/terrace with city views. The location of the hotel is one of the best about it - situated just 5 minutes from Via Diagonal and 15 minutes walk from pl. Catalunya or 5 minutes by taxi. Just take a look on the hotel website and You'll get an idea!",
            "This is a boutique style hotel in Barcelona , close to the Metro which gets you downtown in 10 to 15 minutes. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly. The rooms are beautifully decorated in a modern chic style , including flat screen T.V , MiniBar and Air Conditioning. Our teenagers had a twin room which had 2 beds and a seperate sofa and still ample room for luggage , they also found the free wifi a bonus. Our own room had a huge king size bed and a luxurious bathroom which included one of the best showers we have ever seen.The bar area is also in a chic style , with good service , the only downside to our stay was probably the inflated price of the drinks in the bar, which probably accounted for the lack of people using it which resulted in a lack of atmosphere ; the management would be well advised to drop drink prices and encourage more customers and create a Buzz !",
            "This hotel is an excellent value, very clean and modern. Excellent free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. Breakfast was not great and is probably the only area where the hotel didn't meet or exceed expectations. There are numerous shops and restaurants surrounding the hotel which is very convenient.",
            "Stayed for 2 nights and must say was pleasantly surprised. Large rooms, nice and clean. Nice bathroom with shower and bath and also english speaking staff so checking in and out is easy. For the price, you get a great stay in a convenient place. One train from Sagrada Familia and 2 from beach. 25 minutes walk from La Rambla. Had a great stay and would use them again.",
            "We stayed here for three nights and the only criticism we can think off is that the location means that to do anything in town you need to take metro (only 2 minutes walk away) or taxi. Before leaving we read up on the immediate area and it sounded lively and full of bars. It has some life but as much we expected (this for many could be a positive aspect). On to the hotel itself. Modern design, bit dark but stylish. Our room was excellent, huge bed, plenty of space and a good bathroom, nicely designed with view from bathroom to bedroom. Breakfasts were great and all the staff helpful and willing. Would recommend U232 with only the warning about the location.",
            "Nice hotel. Comfy beds. Easy access to both metro and buses. Staff at reception very pleasant and helpful. Restaurants, shops, cafes and supermarkets nearby. More Positives Good nights sleep free internet access with a printer for the residents gym on 10th floor with the added bonus of an open air leisure area beside it. Negatives A little out from La Rambla and beach. However a number 59 bus provided quick and easy access.",
            "Thanks to this hotel and it's location we were able to spend time away from the crowded tourist traps and experience real Barcelona: warm and cosy restaurants, locals watching football at their neighbourhood bars etc. However, the hotel is not actually that far away from the sights, Barcelona's excellent and cheap metro system will take you anywhere in the city and the Hospital Clinic station is located only 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel is decorated with unique, modern style inside out the hotel. The reception staff was friendly and we got some excellent restaurant tips as well as instructions how to reach different sites. The free wireless network is available everywhere in the hotel, but the idle time is set very short and you may need to reconnect quite often. Perhaps the only minus for this hotel experience was the breakfast. Even though the basic selection was adequote, the quality of food was not consistent. Warm dishes at the buffet were not warm enough and the local tomato sauce for bread should be available all the time.",
            "We stayed at U232 for four nights. It was our first time in Barcelona and we enjoyed our stay at U232. Here are some pros and cons: Pros: - Very good value - Close to the metro (approx 5 mins walk) - Travel times via metro to the centre are approx. 15 - 20 minutes depending on where you go. Metros go every 2.5 minutes or so. - Good sized rooms (we stayed on the 6th floor overlooking the court yard in a U232 room) - Clean, modern and very quiet. - Very helpful staff - Free WIFI - Late checkout (noon) - Close to Maitea Taberna (good value and quality tapas) - Supermarket and ATM around the corner. Cons: - No iron & iron board. There are laundry facilities available but at high prices. Approx 8 Euros for washing and ironing a single shirt. We ended up buying a travel iron at Carrefour. - No clock in the room. No big deal when you are on holidays but somewhat surprising. - Relatively expensive breakfast. Better value breakfast options are available across and down the road. - The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a double glass window. Inside the double glass appear to be some blinds which can be electronically adjusted. However this did not work for us. Not a big deal for us, but we found it surprising that it could not be manually adjusted. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at U232 and would recommend this hotel.",
            "My boyfriend and I have just returned from u232 after a week's stay. It is a really nice, clean and modern hotel. Rooms are of an excellent size and are of a high standard. The hotel is ideally located for the metro, and is a 20 minute walk away from La Ramblas. It is worth buying a T10 card which allows you 10 trips on the metro and can be shared. The roof terrace is a gorgeous space to read, sunbathe and have drinks with some jazz in the background. I would definitely stay here again!",
            "Arrived @ 11 am, and was able to check in straight away. Staff friendly and polite. Our room was on the 10th floor and just as we had imagined it would be, clean, modern and very spacious. Bathrooms nice only down side was that one of the showers did not work and the one that did was slow. One big down side for me was that we were unable to have the use of an iron in the room as the hotel only offer an ironing service. Hotel location only one block away and very easy to use! We had a T10 ticket and this lasted for three days for two of us and the cost was under 9 Euro. I would recommend this hotel as all in all we really enjoyed having it as a base for our city trip.",
            "We stayed at this excellent Hotel for two nights to attend the first U2 360 Concert at Camp Nou. The location was just superb. 15minute taxi to Camp Nou. 2 minute walk for the underground station to expore the city of Barcelona. There is a caferteria just as you go out of the Hotel on the right and a supermarket around the block on the left. I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff is nice. The hotel is clean and the location as mentioned above is simply superb.",
            "Nice hotel for the value. Rooms were over sized for European standards. We had a room on the top floor with a great terrace including table and chairs. Small fitness room but offered if it's on your list of musts. Not sure why you'd place 15 or 20 euro for breakfast when there are great little coffe shops within a block or two.",
            "Hotel U232 just rocks! I was recommended to stay at U233 by none other than fellow Tripadvisor travelers (of course - who else do you actually trust with great travel suggestions?). After having read the rave reviews, I made my reservation through Wonderlandhotels - which in itself was an absolute pleasure to deal with - one of their representatives, Ali was fantastic, and could not have been more helpful. U232 is so centrally situated and within convenient walking distances from all major attractions. The Hotel itself is spotless, and very swish. Great interior design - and everything worked! The rooms were a pleasure - and the housekeeper staff were excellent and thoroughly impressed me. The little touches added to one's comfort and just made the experience that much more pleasurable. I must make special mention of the wonderful front desk assistance we received. No request was too much trouble. In particular, I must single out Mr Sebastian Elorza who really was fantastic in giving us general touristy kind of trips, and in particular, his recommendations as to which restaurants to visit. Two of them, namely el Pintor and Paco Meralgo hit the nail right on the head - and were really great gastronomic experiences . To Sebastian, all staff, and management, a HUGE thumbs up - you guys are doing a fabulous job. Many thanks, Dirk, 17 on Loader Guest House, Cape Town.",
            "I stayed for 8 nights at this hotel in April 2011. My stay here was fantastic. I loved the staff, loved the ample size of the room and loved that I was far enough away from the downtown that I had to walk 30 minutes to get anywhere (although this might not be for everyone). The staff spoke English very well and seemed to either want to speak English or Catalan as they were very proud of their Catalan heritage. The staff were also very eager to help one out to find a nice restaurant and I took them up on their offer on more than one occasion. There were 2 slight downsides: a) the room pointed at nothing, but hey! I don't stay in a different city for a perfect landscape view b) Breakfast was way too expensive, and so I didn't pay for it. Next time I stay in Barcelona I would come back to this hotel as I really enjoyed my stay here.",
            "Drawbacks: - The location is a bit far fetched; for example, It takes approximately 30-45 minutes to walk from the hotel to Plaza de Catalonia - The noise from the street Urgell. The first night we had a twin room at the second floor with windows out against the noisy street Urgell. However, we were able to change to a quiet double room the following four nights. - Our room was a bit small, however the bathroom was okay Advantages: - Nice interior - Friendly staff - A lot of accessories in the bathroom - Free Internet",
            "We grabbed a three day break in Barcelona just before Easter. The hotel was a pleasant surprise - very helpful staff and the rooms were clean and comfortable- would def stay here again. Dont be put off by the distance out of the centre - thats a plus - either grab a cab(Euros8~10 to the center), or take the Metro for aro Euro1.40 for a single trip (its a short walk of about 200m). Good Friday was really busy at all the attractions (as all the shops were closed) good idea to take the tour bus to get your bearings.",
            "Lovely hotel. Staff very helpful. We arrived after midnight and wanted a drink the bar was closed but the receptionist gave us a map and showed us where to go. They also booked a dinner and show for us. The rooms were very very clean and the decor was great, good hairdryer, powerful shower, mirror and lighting good. What more do you need!",
            "U232 offered better service than most 5* hotels we stayed. Everything was just right for us. - Friendly, always helpful staff that speaks English - Very accommodating when we switched rooms because of the street noise. (Barcelona - - was very noisy because of the soccer world cup celebrations.) - Breakfast was very nice, with something for everybody - The entrance and the rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean - Free PCs with fast and reliable internet connection, which we didn't have in any other hotel in Spain. - Parking is available right next door I don\u2019t think that Barcelona has another hotel that offers that much value for its price. We payed 90 Euro with a great breakfast and welcoming drinks. The location didn\u2019t seem that great in the beginning, but we realized that by taking the bus instead of the subway (2 bus lines are just 2 minutes away and those buses covered all our needs) it was easy and cheap to get around.",
            "I have become a regular visitor to this hotel thanks to its exceptional value for money. The hotel has a modern look to it but with all the warmth of the latin people. The rooms are excellent and there is also plenty of options to hold small/medium sized meetings with clients. Internet is free of charge ! Only negative side is the breakfast, a bit expensive for what you get. Should be improved and certainly increase the variety to offer. Would recommend both for business and leisure, better for couples or small families.",
            "We stayed here for 2 nights on a recent holiday. The hotel staff were helpful and efficient. The hotel lobby is warm and cosy. Our room had a balcony and was of a good size. The decor was of good quality and the room and bathroom were very clean. The location of the hotel is approximately 30 minutes walk to La Rambla, however, there is a metro stop only 2 minutes away. There are numerous shops and businesses in the area. The area is quiet at night, so you will need to travel to more lively areas to find a nice bar or restaurant. Free wifi is available also. Overall, a great stay and excellent value. I would stay again definitely.",
            "A very positive experience. The hotel offered a very good rate for a fully cancellable booking - under \u20ac85/night. We arrived early in the morning, but the hotel let us have our rooms immediately - greatly appreciated after an overnight flight. Desk staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms are stylish and comfortable. (Smallish by American standards, but just fine actually) Wifi Internet is free, and there is a computer center for printing boarding passes and the like. The location is slightly off the beaten path (in Eixample about a 20 minute walk from the Passeig de Gracia) but take advantage of that and view the beautiful Beaux Arts architecture in the neighborhood. It's also nice to have some distance from the Rambla. I did not eat breakfast at the hotel (there are inexpensive cafes right on the corner) and there is no gym. I would happily stay here again.",
            "We stayed at the U232 in Barcelona June 1-3, 2011 and had a great experience. We arrived very early in the morning, hours before check in, but the friendly and helpful staff stored our luggage for us, gave us the wireless code, and a comfortable place to sit and relax. By the time we'd had a cup of coffee and checked our email, our (spacious) room was ready. If I was forced to find one fault, it would be that something they used in the hotel (an air freshener or cleaner?) was a bit overpowering. It was located in a nice area with easy access to anything you would want. I would gladly recommend this hotel.",
            "the hotel is very calm, with pleasant jazz background music in the common spaces, excellent accessibility Internet, public transport means to walk, rooms and lobby very fashion and clean, You can reach all points of interest of the City with Metro located at 50 meters from the hotel",
            "Stayed here for 4 nights and really loved it. Check-in went smoothly and personnel is very friendly and helpful. The hotel and rooms look like new; it's very clean and tidy. In the room there are all kinds of bathroom amenities offered. Metro stop Hospital Clinic is only like 100metres away and there are nice places nearby for breakfast or midnight snack (probably also for lunch and dinner, but we were not at/near the hotel during the day).",
            "Just stayed here with my husband for two nights and were so glad we chose the U232. We went for the \"top room\" which cost half as much as a standard room in many hotels off La Rambla. Location turned out to be good, actually, if you don't mind hopping on the Metro--only a block from the Hospital-Clinic Metro stop, which is just a few stops from the train station and also the Segrada Familia. The room (908) was absolutely fantastic. We loved the huge private balcony on a corner, with 180 degree views over the city. The bathroom was very spacious with a shower I would love to have in my house--two shower extensions, plus a rain shower. The hotel was stylish and very clean, with helpful staff, a business center with free internet access and a printer. Oh--and breakfast was really good as well...great coffee."

            "This small hotel is nestled down a quiet city street and is convenient, affordable, and clean. As with most tourists, we spent the majority of our time outside of the hotel. However, we did make great use of our private terrace for a little happy hour before returning to the City for the evening.",
            "Good location, good rooms, perfect staff We stay at Hotel Grifo and really enjoy it.. The hotel is in a small street near the main street via nazionale.. The location was perfect.. Walking distance from the most important spots of the city! (5min from the Colosseum!!) Nice neighborhood where you can find very good restaurants, small shops, supermarket, etc.. The room was a little bit small but in the city center you can not expect more.. Comfortable beds and clean rooms.. Chamber maids very friendly, and a good breakfast.. The staff are super helpfull!! They will show you where to eat good food and give you good tips how to visit Rome! (Roma pass is a good deal!! ) We will stay again here on our next trip in Rome",
            "We spent 3 nights here exploring rome Jan 2012 & could not of found a better hotel for the price etc. Staff were helpfull , room clean, & heating was fantastic, had to turn the heating down as our room was boiling hot & for January in rome thats fantastic. Room was small but everything was there & after a days sightseeing we slept like a log. Roof terrace was a bonus. We recomend this hotel.",
            "This was by far the smallest hotel room that we have ever stayed in! There is barely any room to open your luggage. And the bathroom...the toilet seat was broken, which was taped together and the shower - you can stand in and that's about it...there is no room to move around (not even to wash your hair). If you are just looking for a place to sleep, then this will do it. There is no frills about this place. There is a metro stop near by, so that made it easy to get around Rome.",
            "We stayed at Hotel Grifo for 2 days before going on our cruise. Alessandro spoke very good English and that was a plus. He was full of information and gave us lots of advise on what to see and how to get there. The hotel rooms were small but clean and breakfast was included. That was great. Hotel is within walking distance to the Colesseum. I would stay at this hotel again if I am lucky enough to get to Rome again. Thanks to the staff at Grifo",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Grifo during our two week trip to Italy for the first time! We arrived and were immediately assigned a room but were moved without hesitation when we discovered our air conditioner was not working. We were very appreciative of the assistance as we were not used to the kind of humidity and heat! Our newly assigned room was on the top floor of the main building and while the hotel does offer a small elevator, we chose to take the twisting, winding stairs up to the top for the experience! It was fun! A little scary on the way down, but fun! The breakfast in the morning is exactly what you would want before a long day of sightseeing. They offered a nice variety and we always left full and satisfied. Everyone we encountered at the front desk was so kind and helpful. They were always genuinely interested in our day and wanting to know how we were enjoying the city. They always suggested the best restaurants and the best spots to have some gelato. We asked a ton of questions, always asked for directions and never once did they make us feel like we were a bother. This is a cute little hotel in a perfect location. Surrounded by tons of restaurants and within walking distance of some pretty amazing sights. You can't go wrong staying at the Hotel Grifo!",
            "The Hotel Grifo is wonderful!!! Their rooms are simple but exceptionally clean and spacious. The most impressive part of the stay was how resourceful, kind and hospitable the staff were. Everyone throughout the stay treated us like guests to their own home. I will surely stay there the next time I visit Rome. Kayte del Real",
            "The hotel's location is brilliant being a short walk from most of the city's most important monuments.. its in a quaint cobbled alleyway which give it the only sense of character it has. The staff are very friendly.. and when we forgot something in the room they kept it for us until our return to the hotel 4 days later which was very sweet of them. We did opt for private bathrooms which is great because the showers on some floors are on the other side of the floor.. and its not really what u want to b doing while on holiday. The rooms are a little small, but you might get lucky and get one with a cute balcony or one of the most spacious rooms. I would opt out of breakfast.. stale cereal adn a few bits of bread really wasnt my thing.. Overall the hotel is excellent value for money, close to town, pretty surroundings.. near the main train station and you couldn't ask for money for that price.",
            "As the first place I slept in Rome, the Grifo has a spot in my heart b/c from start to finish, it was a relief. We had never been to Rome for vacation, w/ all arrangements made by us. Hours of reading bad online reviews had driven us to spend more than preferable for our first 2 nights in Italy. Jalel at front desk spoke English. He and other Grifo staff were very kind, helpful, and on hand. I knew to dispense w/U.S. notions of room size for that amt. of money but it was fine, just slightly thrift-shop regarding the decor. A comfortable room, and bed especially. Some storage space in the closet, a clean, decent sized bath w/a tiny shower (tall, big or heavy people wd be vexed), and a pleasant breakfast room with a variety of continental choices. The Grifo serves the tourist trade but is tucked away on a side street and feels cozy to come back to. Colosseum and Trevi Fountain are @15 min. walk in opposite directions. A 3-block walk to the subway and 1 stop to the Termini. Numerous small charming restaurants in the area used by locals, some right on Via Boschetto. I cd imagine some whiny reviews about noise sleeping over the din of a street full of talk, laughter, and motorcycles (on a week night), but it didn't bother us; who cares if you're in Rome!",
            "Alessandro was a wonderful help. He was on the day shift, just when we needed advice, suggestions and directions. Rosa was also helpful in the evening. Their command of English was more than adequate. Our room was not huge, but plenty big enough to move around in. Hotel has a cosy little eating room for the included breakfast, one of the best we had on our trip. There is a computer in the adjoining bar area for (free) use by guests. Just ask Alessandro for a password. Location was great for walking or catching city busses. We recommend the nearby Carbonara restaurant. I\u2019d go back tomorrow!!!! !",
            "Concierge Alessandro constantly went out of his way to be incredibly helpful. His knowledgeable (and polite and cheerful) guidance about sightseeing is the best a tourist could ever ask for! The hotel is a great value! It's also very close to the Coliseum and the forum, as well as to bus lines that go to the train station and to much of the rest of sightseer's Roma. Would definitely stay again!",
            "My husband, myself, our 18 year-old daughter and her best friend stayed at the Hotel Grifo for three nights in July 2011. It was a great hotel. Very clean and the staff was very helpful. It had a beautiful garden rooftop that was lovely. Would definitely stay there again!",
            "This hotel is the perfect spot from which to explore Rome. It's on a side street, an easy walk to the Colliseum and Forum, and not too far from the subway. There are plenty of restaurants nearby for either a quick coffee or dinner. The staff was very helpful, and the breakfast offered delicious croissants. We were in the annex, just across the street (which is all that was available when we booked). Another time, we would choose to stay in the main building, as the wireless internet service did not reach across the street. But the room was clean, quiet and very much met our needs for our two nights in Rome.",
            "We stayed 3 nights. The man at the desk during the day really made us feel at home. He was very helpful suggesting to us what were the best sights and when they were the least crowded, what areas not to spend money because they gouged tourists, what restaurants were good, etc. We enjoyed just talking to him about Rome. The rooms are plain but we stayed on the top floor where there's a nice terrace. We'll stay here again if we have the chance.",
            "Stayed here 25/25 Nov 2011.More than happy with loction and ease of finding. Just off the Via Nazionale Staff very friendly.And helpful Hotel verry clean.Happy with room as I came to see Rome and not the hotel.Although I would say my room had the smallest shower in Rome. would say was I was not happy the 8 euro (4pp)city tax I had to pay when booking out beware. Check tariffs before buying from bars near tourist sites you could be in for a expensive shock! !",
            "We are a young(ish) couple from NYC who have both traveled extensively in Europe but had not spent much time in Italy before. After reading many of the reviews on TA, I booked 4 nights at the Hotel Grifo to conclude a 2-week trip across Italy as we felt confident that Grifo would be similar to the other budget-friendly hotels we had booked for our trip. Unfortunately the hotel left much to be desired & it was clear upon arrival that the website did a great job of marketing the only benefits of the property - such as it's lower out of pocket & proximity to Termini, which was a pretty easy 10-15 minute walk. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, I had a bad feeling. There was just something seedy looking about it that I can't quite describe. Although the man at check-in was more than cordial, I couldn't help but be distracted by the buzzing fluorescent lighting and overwhelming bathroom smell permeating the air. We continued up to our room which was basic but clean. The bathroom was smaller than any other we'd encountered during our 2-week stay in Italy, so much so that the stand-up shower flooded as soon as the water came on. Having arrived in Rome after stays in various properties over in Venice, Florence & Siena - we just couldn't justify 100 Euro/per night for a hotel that felt so creepy & decided it was best to leave. Again, the staff was more than accommodating when we told them we would be checking out the next morning. We moved on to another hotel in the area & couldn't have been happier with our decision. Like anything else, it is all about expectations and what you want from a hotel. I am fine with basic accommodations provided that they are comfortable, clean & safe and unfortunately Grifo did not give fulfill that role for me. I would say this hotel is at the low-end of the \"budget\" class - somewhere between a roadside motel in the U.S. and a youth hostel abroad.",
            "On an alley that is used as a freeway, it's noisy and dangerous to walk the area. The room they put us in overlooked the street on the main floor and when we complained about the noise, that goes on ALL night, they would not move us. You will have to close the windows and turn the AC all the way up to go to sleep. The rooms are tiny and bathrooms are tiny. You'll be lucky if you don't drop anything in the shower because you wont be able to bend over to pick it up. It will be all you can do to turn around without having your arm adjust the hot water flow. Ours had a broken mirror and a toilet flushing mechanism only the \"Beverly Hillbillies\" would be proud of. Breakfast was OK, but nothing to boast about. Doesn't anyone put fruit out anymore? The bar was silly and there was NO safe in the room we stayed in. The price was high for what you got but they would subtract 8% if you paid in cash.",
            "After spending several hours and reviewing several hotels in Rome for the time we were staying, I chose the Hotel Grifo and glad I did. It was convenient to all of the ruins and sites of Central Rome. Most of all, the staff were all very kind and willing to help us. Our trip was delayed one day because of the weather here in the states. When we called the hotel, they were understanding and told us it was no problem. They had air conditioning for summer and heat for the winter. They also had the nicest lani outside of our room that opened up and somewhat extended our room. I would recommend this hotel to any one looking for a place to stay in Rome at any time.",
            "I stayed at this hotel in a quad room /w balcony in May 2011. The room was spacious enough for the 4 of us (all women, ages 30-50). Bathroom a little small, but adequate. We had lovely views from the balcony and had the opportunity to eat lunch there one afternoon. The location could not be beat. We were just off Cavour near the Coliseum. There were numerous restuarants and local shops right on our street. We had breakfast included in our rate. They had cold cuts, yogurt and cereal. Not spectacular, but it started us off for the day.",
            "We reserved a quad room for 2 adults and 2 children ages 10 and 12. The room and bathroom are not fit for 4 people. The room is gloomy and dark. Air conditioning is not adequate and they turn the A/C off at night. The back door of the room opens to grungy industrial looking equipment and the bathroom window opens into a heating well. The stairs are inconvenient and the overall feel of the room is low class. The location of the hotel is good. I would definitely not recommend the hotel for quad occupancy. For the price, there are other options in Rome that will be better, we stayed in one on our return back to Rome.",
            "Stayed twice during our recent tour of Europe. Wonderful staff, especially Alessandro (speaks 8 languages) and Rosa. Quiet, cute, safe neighborhood - easy walk to Colosseum, Forum, and lots of other sites. Room spotless, great breakfast!! Very close to Metro/train station.",
            "This hotel needs a little sprucing up. The rooms are small, and the walls are all stained. The cupboards in the rooms have peeling contact paper. The bathrooms also leave much to be desired, you have to push the button on the toilet about 20 times to build up pressure to flush. The tv in the room also did not work for the entire 3 days of the stay. I repeated told the staff but they did nothing.",
            "Hotel Grifo was well situated about a 5 minute walk from the Coliseum. Quad room for family of 4 was adequate in size, but air conditioner was very little relief from the Roman July heat. After notifying the desk clerk of our hot room we finally asked for a fan which did help some. A/C in most of Rome seemed to be ineffective against extreme heat, so I don't think Hotel Grifo is alone, but temperature in the room was often warmer than on the terrace. Be forewarned if you travel to this hotel in July or August! Probably a much different experience in the cooler months. Breakfast was included in the room price and was decent, just make sure you get there early in the morning to ensure the best selection.",
            "My family booked this hotel for a week, what a mistake. We stayed one night and found a new hotel. The room was small, the bed was only 5 feet long and the matteress was only a couple inches thick. Also, the lamps were attached to the laws with duck tape. The staff was nice but our room was terrible. Hotel Ivanho was cheaper, cleaner, and located by this Hotel. Stay there instead.",
            "This is local to many of the sites but it's alot of walking regardless. I would return during a cooler month...it was in the 90's the entire time my son and I were there. I also recommend if you're running to i.e. sisten chapel --don't wait for the bus just take the taxi so you won't miss it. Rome sightseeing could easily take 5 days but 3-4 would do it. Luigei---you're best---thanks Cettina & Marc from NJ!! !",
            "The hotel is ideally located in the vicinity of Colosseo, Forum Romanum and other main historical attractions and also metro station is very close. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Yet,the rooms were a bit of a disappointment for me- they were quite small and basic (I understand these are old buildings), mostly what disturbed us was the dampness in the room and that the heating didn't seem to work properly for some reason. My parents stayed in another room on the top floor with a terrace and that room was better and warmer/no dampness. Rooms were cleaned daily and towels changed. The breakfast was good enough with rolls, croissants, cheese, turkey, salami, youghurt, cereals etc.- ok every day it was exactly the same (it would have been nice if they would have changed the variety of sausages etc.). Yet, concerning what price we paid (only 68\u20ac) it was value for money and I can reccommend this hotel for people who don't require too much luxury, but appreciate good service and location.",
            "My husband and I stayed at Hotel Grifo for 3 nights at the beginning of January. Alessandro was amazing! Upon checking in, he offered us tickets to an exclusive underground archaeological site that only opens for tours one month a year (and sells out immediately.) A couple of friends backed out on him at the last minute, so we were fortunate to be in the right place at the right time, and we went to the tour with Alessandro and his girlfriend. The location of the hotel is wonderful, down a little side street not far from the metro, which made it fairly easy to get to the main sights, though we ended up walking most of the time, as Rome has only 5 metro lines and there is so much to see between the stops. I found our room very comfortable and the size was not an issue. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and will certainly stay here myself when I next return to Rome.",
            "I take small tour groups to Italy in the summers and when we visit Rome we always stay at the Hotel Grifo. it is reasonably priced and the location is superb. It is close to the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona and many of the major sites in Rome. I love the neighborhood around the hotel. There are very good, reasonably priced restaurants and shops nearby. It is quiet, although it is close to several major streets making bus and metro access easy. Alessandro and his staff are excellent. They are very helpful and give lots of advice about good places to eat and shop. I have had to rearrange reservations for people in my group and Alessandro is always accommodating. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is good. I always request rooms with terraces in the hotel and enjoy sitting outside with a little wine and cheese. Many people in my tour groups have commented how much they enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Grifo.",
            "This was my third time in Rome, but my first time in Hotel Grifo. My boyfriend and I stayed here from January 19th to January 22nd, 2012. We booked through Expedia and paid a total of 162 Euro for a three night stay, which is an unbeatable price for the location! You can walk to every attraction, and take a night stroll around the Colosseum, which is less than 10 minutes away. After reading the reviews, I was a bit concerned about having a shared bathroom and about problems with the heating, so I wrote an e-mail and got an answer right away. They told me we would have our own ensuite bathroom, and that heating problems were already fixed. They're really nice and attentive, so if you have any doubts, e-mail them. Our room (122) was not as small as people say, perhaps we were lucky. It was a normal room, only the shower was tiny. We had a window in the room an another in the bathroom, both facing the street, but we didn't suffer any noise because the windows are new. The bed was really comfortable, and everything was spotlessly clean. Decoration was quite tasteless, but hey, we only went there to sleep. The only thing I didn't like at all was the door; it seemed ancient and didn't fit the frame, so you could actually see the room's ceiling through a strip from the outside. Also, the key was very old and key wards were inexistent, so I'm pretty sure it would have fitted in other door's locks. It's a small place, so you didn't get a sense of insecurity because nobody can sneak inside without people noticing, but being a woman I wouldn't stay there on my own. Breakfast was simple but nice; good coffee, croissants, cereal, juice, nutella, etc. I missed a toaster for the bread. Free Wifi is a plus, and location is so nice that I'd probably stay there again. But please... NEW DOORS!",
            "We arrived late and got a small room with W/C however the shower was not ensuite. We got the explanation that this the way it is with the basic room and went to sleep disappointed. Next morning asked Alessandro about the possibilities to change the room. He took it seriously, managed to get us another room in the annex (just in front of the hotel - very convenient), he delt with the problem in the most efficient way. The room was perfect. Ensuite w/c and shower included, WIFI worked well. Location is excellent, we walked everywhere even though public transportation is near (metro and buses). Breakfast was nice, many good restaurants around. Piccolo Buco near the Fontana de Trevi is an extraordinary place to eat. Above all, it is Alessandro that makes the Grifo a great place to stay. He was helpful (we got very useful hints that saved us time and money), efficient, intelligent and always prepared to help. Grazie mille Alessandro!! !",
            "But on this occasion - small rooms, even smaller bathroom (couldn't turn around in the shower), breakfast not worth having and to top it all off we had money stolen from our room. My wife left her purse in room for 15 mins and when we came back $400 had been taken. How do we know this... we had just counted our money as we were leaving that day. Only good thing is the location.",
            "We were welcomed warmly, pleasantly surprised to get a little terrace off our little room, and directed to the best nearby restaurant (Taverna Marin). It has an elevator, breakfast room, roof terrace, bar off the lobby, and friendly staff. Five minute easy walk to the colloseum. For an inexpensive hotel (for Rome) in a walkable, central area, it was perfect.",
            "We stayed for 4 nights at The Grifo Hotel. We really like this place. The location is excellent for historial rome and good for the rest of the central area it is also close to Cavour Metro station. The rooms are small and the hotel clean. The breakfast is good. A nice mix of national guests. All of the staff were suberb. Everyone from the lady who help serve breakfast to the reception staff were happy and helpful. The reception staff were excellent and we didn't need a tour guide after chatting each morning and getting tailormade expert advise on what to see, where to go and how to get there. Local restaurants - pizzerias, tavernas, winebars, indian restaurant good. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Thanks for our stay.",
            "Quite pricey for this small room. Old with mismatched beddings and moldy smell. Old rugs with broken closet. Fuzzy TV. Elevator is also very small which is very hard when you have big luggages. Only one hotel personnel would assist you. Although Rosa (hotel personnel) is very accomodating and helpful, I don't think this hotel has something else to offer. Some restaurants nearby but tends to be noisy during at nighttime. Accessibility is so-so. the hotel location is about 20 minutes walk to Colloseo. should you wish to go around and see Rome ,you can take the Metro which is few minutes walk from the hotel. From the airport, you can take a group shuttle to your hotel and will cost you less than 50 euro but it would take you more than an hour to get to your hotel. Because the driver need to drop off passengers to different hotels. If you are two persons and wished to take the Leonardo Express from the airport to Termini station then transfer to a cab to this hotel, it will cost you practically the same. Hotel is about 30 kilometers from the airport. Since we need to leave early from the hotel to the airport for our next destination, we have asked their personnel to arrange airport transfer solely for us. For regular hours charges is 50 euro and 70 euro for (10pm-7am) service. When we were checking out, all lights at the reception area were turned off, It was very dark,we can only see the light of their pc. The reception clerk didn't bother to open the lights much more didn't even bother to offer us a seat while waiting for our ride. He just took our key and leave us at the reception area without even speaking to us. Well, maybe he is still sleepy. He only showed up again when our driver knocked. He didn't say a word. That's what you call service?",
            "The hotel was very nice. A verry good location! Everything was near by and you can walk to the most touristic atractions. Around the hotels are a lot of nice restaurants and small shops. The stuff was verry friendly and helpful. And also the breakfast was good. So i can realy recoment this hotel to everybody.",
            "Toilet was used & unflushed prior to us arriving in the room !! Also the stairwell had no lights working making the steps very dangerous at night - we asked for these to be fixed on our first day & 3 days later they were still not working. Reception staff forgot to arrange an airport pickup so we had to get the train & when we arrived there was no help regarding places to go & how best to get around the city. There is no welcome pack or any info in the room not even any dialing numbers for reception.Breakfast area is not big enough to accomodate the guests so we were standing around waiting for people to finish & we never once saw the bar area open. The location is good however there are hotels nearby of a higher star rating for the same price. Would not recommend this hotel.",
            "The reception staff are so helpful at this hotel. They have great advice about where to eat and how to get the most out of your stay in Rome providing you with helpful tips. The hotel has a nice Terrace where you can sit and have a drink while looking over some of the surrounding rooftops. Its very clean and pretty central to most site seeing activities in Rome. You just walk down the road to get to the Coloseum. Great hotel and would definitely stay here again.",
            "The staff was very friendly and many of them spoke english very well. The room and shower left much to be desired by American standards (large people could not shower here). Great location near lots of restaurants and shopping, very close to the Collisum. Breakfast Buffett left much to be desired.",
            "My wife and I booked a trip to Rome for a quick get away. We didnt know where we were going to stay until we walked up a side street and into Hotel Griffo. The man at the desk \"Zorro\" was extreemly helpful and spoke good english. He helped us book a room and Rome tours. The breakfast was really great and the rooms were only 90 euro/night. They had wireless internet but wouldnt reach past the 2nd floor but did have a PC in the lobby we could use. The shower was a joke (16 inches x 16 inches) so if u drop the soap u are in a bind. But everything else was great and we would stay there again.",
            "Positive things: 1)The location is perfect for visiting Rome, close mainly to Colloseum, but also to every other touristic attraction by foot. Around the hotel you can find several terraces and a very good \"gelateria\". 2)Alesandro was very welcoming and helpful with all kinds of tips&tricks, he really makes the difference compared to other hotels and makes you feel like anything you could need he could find a solution or an answer. The chamber-maid was also very nice. 3)The breakfast I think it's a good one compared to Italian style with a particular good juice. Not so good things: 1)The temperature in the shower was fluctuating and became cold when you started to feel better after a tiring day (in addition there was no hair-dryer). The sewerage was very poor and you had to close the water during the shower in order not to flood the bathroom. This was the most annoying thing in this hotel. 2)The view was awful (we had a standard double room with bathroom inside, no 31) towards the inside part of the building with warped walls, kitchens from other apartments etc. Fortunately, Rome is much too interesting to spend the time in the room and we kept the curtains closed (though the room was quite gloomy). 3)Because of the limited space for the breakfast, we always had to wait for the staff to bring more of what we wanted to eat. There was always a lady that had to take r bring something in a quite narrow place. The croissants were never enough, especially if you came after 9:30",
            "We stayed there for two nights (April 24 and 25) and wish we had stayed for longer. Rosa and the folks there are great and helpful. The family room was large enough and the terrace was great. Great coffee with nice cold cuts and cheese plus yogurt, cereal, jams, and bread. The shower stall was very small and I am very big but I did manage so other folks should be ok too. The location was great. An easy walk to the Coliseum, Forum, Palatine Hill, Capitalone Hill, and train station. The elevator was small but not too small and worked fine. The area around the hotel is great for dining and relaxing with a wonderful gelato place right behind it. While there is wireless internet I did not get a signal in the room so I had to take my laptop down to the dining room.",
            "We stayed in the hotel's annexe - a small apartment for 2 nights. 'Shabby chic' would be a polite way to describe it and it was a bit of a walk from the main hotel - so it won't suit some people. For example, it would be a long walk for breakfast if it was raining. But for us there was beautiful sunshine so we enjoyed the little walk. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and found the staff friendly and very helpful with directions, transport advice, leaving our luggage etc. Breakfast was fine. Great location - lots of little restaurants and bars nearby and we started to feel at home in the area very quickly. I would stay there again.",
            "We picked this hotel to try and balance price and amenities. The rooms were small which we expected as it is Rome but well maintained. The location is good for access to much of the sites of Rome with good restaurants nearby and the rooftop terrace is a nice place to have a glass of wine or coffee. But the real value in this hotel was the superb staff with special accolades to Alessandro. With only one exception (the night person) everyone was polite, exceedingly helpful about touring and consistently cheerful. Plus the day and early evening crew all spoke English along with several other languages. We would recommend this hotel to anyone trying to maintain some sort of reasonable budget while in Rome and wanting assistance with the daily joys and sorrows of touring a big, unknown city..",
            "A perfect little hotel very close to all the major attractions of Rome. We loved being in the center of the city, yet away from the maddening crowds of the main streets. The great thing was that we could walk everywhere. If you did not want to, a bus stopped right in front of the hotel. Our room was small but sufficient, very clean, cool and quiet and a lovely terrace on the top floor of the hotel to enjoy the cooler evenings. Breakfast was enough to carry you over until lunch. The front desk and staff were very helpful, especially Allesandro who helped us plan our daily tours, suggested off the beaten path sites, ordered transportation and recommended a gem of a restaurant just up the street. When we return to Rome again, we will most certainly stay at the Hotel Grifo. Thanks you for making our Rome experience a great one! The Canadian family.",
            "The hotel was walking distance to everything we wanted to see which is what attracted us to this place to begin with. The room was basic but quite clean. The shower was tiny so fortunately we're average-sized people (but if you drop anything, good luck picking it up!). The pressure in the shower was very low and stopped spraying completely a few times. Breakfast was typical of hotels in Italy. The wi-fi rarely worked during our stay and only down in the lobby. The staff was very helpful and arranged transportation for us when needed. Overall, this is a good, no-frills hotel but the location makes the stay worthwhile.",
            "We had a nice four day stay at the hotel Grifo a few weeks ago. We were on the top floor. As discussed the staff were very nice and helpful. Room was a little small and I have a few minor complaints (the shower was tiny and the toilet ran) but overall a good experience. The private balcony on the fourth floor is outside of the two upstairs rooms and is open to anyone. Not a big deal but not the in-room balcony that I expected/hoped for. Great location and a stunning view of the coliseum after 2 quick left turns outside of the hotel entrance. Some good restaurants and food shops nearby, along with the smell of Indian food from the restaurant across the way which struck me as pretty funny in Rome. Didn't take advantage of the bar untli the last night but got a heck of a pour for 3 euros. Probably our biggest bargain in Rome",
            "We stayed here for about 5 days and can highly recommend this hotel. The location is brilliant. Walking distance form the Coloseum, Trebvi fountain, Spanish steps, Roman forum, etc etc etc. The only place we took a bus to was the Vatican, but it can be walked in 20-ish minutes if you are up to it. Nice roof terrace as well. No food or drinks up there, but get some wine and a pizza and it makes a fine place to relax. The staff were very helpful as well. The room was rather small and the shower almost unworkably small. Breakfast adequate but not great. This is however very minor things compared to what you pay, where you are and how helpful everyone is. I can highly recommend hotel Grifo. Not the most luxuruious hotel, but very good value for your money.",
            "The hotel is in the center of many Rome attractions that are within walking distance. The hotel staff were VERY helpful during our entire stay. They helped on many occasions in making excursion arrangements, taxi/limo arrangements, restaurant suggestions and many of our other needs. This willingness to assist was very helpful to first time visitors in Rome. I would recommend this hotel for both its location plus the attitude and helpfulness of the entire staff.",
            "I really liked it here. The location is superb, on a quite sidestreet, 10-15 mins pleasant walk through charming sidestreets to the Colosseum. Loads of well-priced, popular restaurants in the vicinity, no obvious tourist traps. Feels perfectly safe after dark. This all means you can spend a full day at Colosseum, Palatine Hill, Forum, etc, and walk leisurely back to the hotel via a restaurant without using any public transport, taxis, etc. This is what you want on holiday! It took us about half an hour to walk from Termini Station (which is about our limit wheeling suitcases.) It's probably 10-15 mins walk to either Cavour or Colloseo metro stations, which is why we didn't use the metro with this hotel. Negative points - small rooms. (Bear in mind at this price, you either get small rooms or a less desirable neighbourhood, with budget hotels in cities.) Shower room was down the hallway, which was inconvenient, even though was a nice size and only used by ourselves. Shower not always hot when expected. Also the the tiled floors and small size of the hotel mean noise travels, especially if other guests are inconsiderate. Service very friendly and helpful. Old fashioned hotel desk, you give them your room key whenever you walk out of hotel, always someone on the desk. Breakfast suprisingly good, and plentiful (self service.) Very clean rooms and public areas. In summary a well-run hotel. NB. A historical fact which may fascinate, stimulate or disappoint, depending on your viewpoint - this property was a brothel 30 years ago.",
            "This charming hotel provided comfortable and most welcoming accomodation during our recent 3 night trip to Rome. It is centrally situated in a picturesque area of narrow cobbled streets and ivy clad terracotta buldings and is only a short distance away from the Cavour Metro Station. Just a short walk around the corner and the Colosseum is in view at the end of the road! Everywhere was spotlessly clean and gave the impression that it was really well cared for. In our case, we had a \"basic\" room and, although there was en-suite toilet / wash basin, we already knew that the shower would be located a short distance along the corridor, because older buildings are protected by regulations. This presented no problems since it was for our own private use and we had our own key. Each morning, a substantial cold buffet breakfast was served promptly by 7:30am. This included juices, cereals, selections of bread, meat, cheese, yogurt and spreads. A limitless supply of tea and delicious coffee was also on tap. We enjoyed sitting outside on the upstairs terrace, surrounded bu plants and overlooking activity in the street below. The staff were, without exception, delightful - so friendly, helpful and we were sad to say goodbye. We would certainly return to this hotel on any future visit to Rome.",
            "We spent 4 days in Hotel Grifo and had a wonderful time. The hotel is minutes away from tourist attractions, shopping and a great resturant down the street from the hotel. Go out the door, take a right and stop at the corner, the resturant is on the left. wonderful food and staff. The rooms are small and the bathroom but no different then traveling anywhere else in Europe. We would stay there again!",
            "My mother and I had a great 4 night stay at Hotel Grifo. We had requested in advance that we would require 2 single beds and our request was met. The room was very clean and of more than adequate size. I was relieved that we could sleep well without traffic noise from the major roads. The hotel's location on a quaint cobblestoned side street was fantastic. The metro station \"cavour\" was a convienient 5 minute walk away. We used the metro as a lazy way of getting around the major tourist sites. Although the tourist sites could easily be reached by foot (Except the vatican).",
            "My daughter and I traveled to Italy (Rome, Naples and Sorrento) and stayed at the Hotel Grifo during our Rome stay. We had read reviews of many hotels before selecting Hotel Grifo and I think this research helped us understand that our room would be smaller and the hotel a bit different from a US hotel. With that being said, we really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Grifo. The staff was extremely helpful in recommending restaurants and confirming our walking path for the day. The location is great for those wanting to walk or use the bus to many sites. As other reviews have stated, our room was small (including a very small shower) but it was always very clean and comfortable. We were even able to use the WiFi from our room. The breakfast was also small but for us it was a great start to the day (especially with the friendly breakfast attendant Angela). For us, Rome was all about the sightseeing and having a safe and comfortable home base where we could utilize the staff for directions and advice -- and we received all that in Hotel Grifo.",
            "Our room looked nothing like the pictures. The lobby is actually across the street from the hotel room. It was the smallest room we had in Italy. The beds were very hard! We had our worst sleep here. The phone was out of service the entire 4 nights we stayed there. Every time we needed to use the phone, we had to go down 4 flights of stairs and across the street to use the lobby phone. Our room had so much dust. I will say that it is in a great location since it is near the Coloseum. There are also a lot of shops, cafes, and churches around it. The breakfast was okay. It was sweet bread, cheese and meat, and yogurt. If anything, stay here for the location.",
            "Just returned from 2 nights last weekend. The rate was reasonable, but the room was small and the bathroom and shower smaller still. There was no hot water in the morning and breakfast was poor. The breakfast room is so small, you have to learn over guests to get to the cereal! The staff are very friendly, but I will stay somewhere else next time I go to Rome,",
            "this hotel is located not far rome's major sites . and lies in a quiet street with lots of resurants near. the staff was very helpfull and friendly, they did everything they could in order to make our stay enjoyable. the rooms are clean and comfortable , though it's recomend to ask in advance rooms with toilet rooms, some rooms have joined bathrooms. because we where 3 we recieved a great room a \"penthouse\" with a great balcony. the balcony was the best feature of the room. the breakfast was suffciant. regarding the price the hotel is ok, slightly expensive, but it's rome. the hotel for some fee grants you premision to park the car in nearby streets. even though we payed for the parking we got a ticket. don't use a car in rome",
            "The service was wonderful as the staff were so kind and friendly. Our room was on the top floor and we had a view which was great. Our room also had it's own shower and toilet which is always nice to have. It felt cozy as well, like the hotel. The location is wonderful. It was close to the places we wanted to see and go to. The coffee, well the coffee is to die for and the food is wonderful as well. The only problem for us was, we walked to a bus station to go to somewhere we wanted to see and the bus no longer stopped there so we ended up walking a fair distance to catch the bus. Good news, we saw more things doing this.",
            "We had great time here!!! The location is perfect! 5 minutes from the Colosseum! The area is wonderfull!!! We love the restaurants and gelato place! The rooms are really clean, and the breakfast is good.. I love the coffea! A good start in the morning.. You can find different type of bread, cereals, nutella!!! Really enjoy it! Try to have breakfast on the terrace!!!! The staff? Awesome!! Helpfull and very good in giving tips how to visit Rome! And for the restaurants try \"taverna dei monti\"! Or \"la carbonara\"! Both are near the hotel.. Wi-fi is free but only in the lobby.. We will stay here again!",
            "Very friendly English-speaking staff goes extra mile for exceptional help to make the most of stay. Included breakfast offers generous buffet selections. A family feel to this 21-room hotel. Very clean. Elevator. Local area is not \"touristy.\" So, if you wish to practise a little Italian, this is the locale. If not, English is fine. Hotel Grifo-Roma is surrounded by quaint streets, shops, charming local cafes. Major sights are just minutes by foot or by nearby buses. For a 6-night stay in November we paid about what other hotels, within a half-mile radius, were charging for a single night without the breakfast or local charm and ambiance. One of best values encountered in Europe.",
            "We decided to stay at Hotel Grifo after reading excellent reveiews on TripAdvisor. They turned out to be true! The service was fantastic, perhaps the best at any hotel we've been to. The front desk staff were friendly, offered tips and suggestions, remembered our names and were generally always welcoming. The room was small (like any other in the city), but we comfortably stayed in a triple room. the beds were very small though; slightly smaller than a (USA) twin size. There wasn't much of a view, but the terrace was nice. Breakfast was good with a selection of cereal, bread, wonderful croissants and jams.",
            "If Joe Bradley had taken the Princess to the Hotel Grifo, there would have been a decidedly different outcome. Nonetheless, the Hotel Grifo more than makes up for what it lacks in glamor and panache with outstanding value and a superb location. From the tiny room on the top floor, you have a view, albeit narrow, of the Coliseum and the usual hodgepodge of latticework, rooftop gardens and clothes lines. \u2013 Romans tend to view their roofs as extensions of their apartments. Historic building or not, I was nearly on the verge of buying a bottle of Fantastic and a sponge and cleaning up the scuff marks all over the room. Although, to be fair, all but the most slender among us would be hard pressed to walk around the bed without banging into the wall. Initially, we balked and asked to see another room. The staff did their best to accommodate and offered to move us into a much larger room for the same price. We viewed at least three rooms, but decided to stay put due to the sunlight and the view. Our room felt more like a tree house perched atop the hotel than a regular hotel room. Reachable by a narrow and rickety steel staircase, it boasted a lovely balcony for morning coffee. Among the staff, Alessandro deserves special mention as particularly hospitable and helpful.",
            "Stayed here for 4 nights the week just before Easter. If you looking for a hotel close to ancient Rome this is it. Approximately a 10 min stroll to the Colosseum and Forum. To get to the Trevi fountian is about a 20min walk. (I'm a fast walker, but cant think it will take more than 30mins?). You can get the number 40 bus from close by to the Vatican. It really is so well situated and easy to get around. The staff were very friendly and helpful - even before we arrived and responded to emails very quickly. Very knowledgeable on the area - great suggestions on restaurants and sites. The free wifi is another bonus! In this day and age I dont understand why more hotels dont offer this. The hotel also has a terrace that you can use for a quiet drink at the end of a long day. If I have to give a negative it would be that we had probably the worlds smallest shower, but really thats nothing to complain about. The room was clean and comfortable.",
            "Location is great. you can walk to almost everywhere, and it's very close to public transportation so getting to and from the airport is easy. Price is unbeatable for a comfortable - clean place. Double-glass window provided very good sound insulation - very useful, since it can get noisy at night. Breakfast was ok for us (but expect continental style). The only downside was the size of the sowe cubicle: very minimum. We managed, but if you are average-to-big sized, it can get uncomfortable. Wi fi signal did not reach every room, but it was free!! (and there is always the reception if you got unlucky trying to get a signal) I would go back to this hotel anytime",
            "Stayed at The Grifo beginning April and can honestly say our first two days in the apartment block over the road from the hotel was awful, however and our last two days in the main hotel were much better. The apartment block across from the Grifo holds three hotel rooms on the second floor (no lift) of a private apartment block which is in the process of having its front facia updated, so is scaffolded and covered in sheeting. The room was TINY. It was really a single room with a double bed in it, which was really cramped. The room was dark with old furniture and a stained bed quilt and we had to keep the shutters and curtains closed due to scaffold and builders walking past our 2nd floor windows all hours. Luckily after two days there was a flood in the building, so we got moved to a triple room in the main hotel which was much better experience - light bright, could actually open our shutters and all round so much better. I would NOT recommend the apartments over the road, even when the refurb is finished. With regard to the rest of the hotel, we liked the roof terrace, and the hotel receptionists were pleasant. Breakfast was basic - untoasted bread and croissants - buy a toaster Grifo management - this is a basic breakfast requirement! We loved Rome and enjoyed ourselves immensely in the city and the weather and italian people and dining experiences were just great. Despite a great location near the Collosseum, based on our first two days experience at this hotel, we would not return. PS watch out at check out - the manager said we owed an additional 16 Euros in CASH no RECEIPT as we were Expedia customers for 'tax'. We insisted on a receipt, which he didnt want to do. What is this all about?",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Grifo in November 2010. As many other travelers have noted, the service is outstanding. The location is also wonderful - very close to the Colosseum, and within walking distance to many of the top sites of Rome. The breakfast buffet gets you ready for a day of sightseeing, and if you have any questions, the staff is very accommodating. I would recommend making sure that you bring earplugs, however, as the central location ensures that there is always foot and car traffic right outside your windows. Overall we enjoyed our stay.",
            "The staff at this hotel was extremely friendly, helpful and courteous from the minute we arrived handing us a map with great knowledge of the area to the moment of our departure. The location was superb, just an 8 minute walk to the Colosseum and 5 minutes walk to any form of transportation including metro and buses which is the best way to get around the center. While the room was on the smaller side it was always clean and adequate if you are not looking for a luxury stay. If you are looking for a place to sleep with various restaurants around with a small town feel in a big city this is the place for you. When I visit Rome in the future my plans will be to stay at Hotel Grifo. P.S. After eating gelato every day around various locations in Rome we found \"Il Gelatone\" Gelateria, less then a block away on Via Serpenti, to be THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !",
            "Great little budget hotel. We booked a triple which was a nice size and clean. The hotel is very basic, so dont expect bell boys, etc.. The guy at reception is super friendly and full of soo much good advice. You are 10/15 mins walk from main train station, but just 5/10 to the Colosseum or Piazza Venezia. The location is excellent, in a typical quiet Roman district! At the right price, this is a bargain and would book here again, no doubts! !",
            "This hotel was good value for money. The room was small but well equiped and clean. Although there was a problem with the toilet, Aessandro told us not to worry and it would be sorted out. When we got back from our morning sightseeing - not only had we been given a different room but all our baggage had been moved too. It's in a delightful neighbourhood, which has a lovely village-like atmosphere. There were a number of high quality, low cost resturants near by. It is close to the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona and many of the major sites in Rome. All of the staff that we met were extremely friendly and helpful. Definately would stay again!.",
            "Hotel Grifo was by far our best hotel experience in Europe. My husband and I have traveled all over Europe and found this hotel staff to be the best we have ever encountered. They were extremely helpful with information about the city, tours, restraurants, and transportation. The location is unbeatable, rooms were spotless, reasonable prices and a good european style breakfast included. Highly recommend.",
            "Our family of 4 enjoyed the quad room with the terrace (shared terrace but we were the only ones using it). We got a \"feel for Rome\" as the hotel is not a North American style hotel. It is in a quite area but not far from anything. We had a problem with our A/C during our stay and it was hard to get a repair man due to big vacation time in Rome. Hotel Grifo provided us with 2 fans and they also provide some compensation - the nights cooled down so it was bearable. Breakfast was sufficient, only suggestion would be to have some fruit. Staff were wonderful and helped with suggestions. We would stay there again & recommend this property.",
            "The Grifo is a very nice hotel with familiar atmosphere and typical italian charm! The perfect experience starts with a very friendly reception team, who speak several languages fluently and anticipate every wish! In our case, the reception manager even offered us a better room without any upcharge. The hotel itself is rather small, with a very familiar atmosphere and built in typical italian style. If you are looking for a real italian accommodation with charm and not a chain hotel, the Grifo is perfect for you. The breakfast is a small buffet with everything you need for a good start of the day: croissants, rolls, toast, cereals, italian cheese and ham, several hot and cold drinks,... again in a very nice and typical italian atmosphere. The location is just great, close to the Colosseo and within walking distance of all the famous sights in Rome. We will definetly come back to Rome and back to the Grifo. I can recommend it to everyone who is looking for a typical italian hotel with very friendly staff. It is a real insider tip.",
            "We stayed in the Grifo in July '09 and '10. It has become our hotel of choice. I cannot understand the damning reviews, which is why I have written this belated review. The Grifo really tries. It has an old world politeness and attention to detail The hotel is modest, welcoming and comfortable. In '09 we had a room with a balcony; it was lovely. We assumed this was standard, but it is a little extra. I have had better breakfasts at twice the price, but the coffee was excellent; the cereal could have been better. The breakfast waitress from Romania was the friendliest and most helpful I have come across. Rome has been a favourite destination for over 30 years; I have stayed in many of its hotels. Few can match the Grifo for its combination of location, value and facilities. In my home town, Aberdeen, you could expect to pay more for a lot less. There are many good eating places in the vicinity. The number of excellent notices don't lie. This hotel has a personal touch and goes out of its way to help the traveller and make a holiday memorable. Which is why we have booked again for July 2011 (this time with a balcony).",
            "This is where to stay and get the best out of your stay in Rome. Between the Trevi Fountain and the Collesseum. Everywhere in walking distance (even with a dodgy hip!). We are not seasoned travellers but the staff made all the difference to our stay. There didn't seem to be a language they could not speak, or a limit to the number of questions they answered. The basic room was small but very clean, the hotel was quiet at night (which as we are used to a small village was great), breakfast was plentiful and very good. All the staff's recommendations were great including the local restaurant.",
            "We travelled to Rome with our 20 year old son this spring. As there were three of us it was difficult to find a room big enough to accommodate all of us in such an expensive city as Rome. We were very satisfied with the family room at Hotel Grifo. It is actually two rooms with the bathroom across the hallway. This gave all of us some much needed privacy, and the bathroom really wasn't a problem since it is not shared with any other guests. Unfortunately the bathtub area ceiling was mildewed, but it should be easy to fix up. We also had a very nice balcony which was perfect for evening relaxation. The location is excellent and central. This is certainly a basic hotel, nothing fancy, but it suited our purpose very well.",
            "Found this hotel on the reviews. Was looking for something affordable, comfortable and safe in Rome. This was it. While the rooms aren't 4 star, they are comfortable. We also had a balcony overlooking the street, which was wonderful to sip some wine and relax. The hotel is centrally located to most attractions. Friendly staff.",
            "My family and I spent the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve 2011 in Rome where we stayed at Hotel Grifo. We picked the hotel after closely examining different hotels and their rating at Tripadvisor and we definitely made the right choice, This hotel has about the most perfect location in Rome I can imagine. The relaxing Boschetto street the hotel lies in and the surrounding streets are filled with great reastaurants (I can in particularly recommend 'La Taverna Dei Monti') which were easily found with the brilliant Tripadvisor Rome app. The area the hotel lies in is very cozy and really gives you the feeling of being in Rome with its narrow, slopy and cobbled streets surronded by fantastic architecture. Most of the top tourist attractions we visited were within walking distance and those that weren't, were easily acessed through the metro. The nearest stations is not far away from the hotel. The staff was very welcoming, the room was appropriately sized, the aircondition worked great as both a heater and a cooler of the room, the toilet and bath suited the basic needs and the breakfast was simple yet satisfying. We found the beds were a bit hard though but it was nothing that ruined the overall good impression of the hotel. All in all we had a great stay at Hotel Grifo and we got great value compared to price. We'll definitely consider living here again the next time we stop by Rome!",
            "This small hotel is located in the heart of Old Rome. Easy walking distance to the Colosseum, the Forum, Trevi Fountain and many other \"must see\" sights. There are some excellent restaurants in the area that the concierge will recommend if asked. The hotel staff are very friendly and are more than willing to assist you. The rooms are compact but this is to be expected as you are staying in a 300 year old building that was once a bordello (about 100 years ago). The facility is clean, the bed linen of good quality, and the mattresses are comfortable. It has the only triangular shaped elevator I have ever seen - really quite unique. If you have mobility problems make sure that you ask to stay in the main building, not the annex, as the main building has the elevator. You will still be faced with a couple of steps to get to your room, but it should not be an issue. The showers are small but functional. The continental breakfast included cereal, croissants, pastries, coffee and tea. In summary, the hotel offers a great location and good service at a reasonable price, just be prepared for compact rooms.",
            "I was there 2 weeks ago with my friend and payed a lot of attention to feedbacks before chosing the hotel. It's true: rooms are small. but we had what we needed, as they are clean, the breakfast is honest and at the reception we were given the best suggestions to discover the real Rome. Bravo",
            "I chose this hotel because of the location. Luigi and Alesandro on reception recommended excellent restaurants at very reasonable prices. Angela on breakfast was very pleasant and very efficient. It was lovely to be greeted by a happy, smiling face every morning before the slog of sightseeing! Breakfast was more than adequate: juice, cereal, yogurt, bread, cheese, ham, turkey and good HOT coffee!!! The rooftop terrace was a perfect opportunity to meet other guests and get their feedback. Our triple room (I was a mother with an 18 & 20 year old) was clean and the beds were comfortable.and flat screen TV with CNN! (no fridge,but other rooms had one) As a frequent visitor to Rome (twice a year for the last 15 years) I found Hotel Grifo to be the best. What it lacks in ****ratings it compensates with friendly, helpful staff, cleanliness and the quiet location! !",
            "We stayed 4 nights at the Grifo. The first night we were so exhausted from the flight that we could have slept through anything. The second night -- lots of noise from outside. Though the hotel is on a tiny street, it is pretty busy with vespas and lots of motorcycle traffic. The third night -- lots of noise from inside. The next room next door was listening to the TV very loud. Then there was some arguing couple at the bottom of the stairs. We didn't sleep well either of those two nights. The fourth night was fine -- I guess because we were exhausted again. The hotel's location can't be argued with. In 4 days we took the bus once and walked everywhere including back from the vatican. The bathroom is small but we are small people and the shower that many people seem to feel is very small is actually bigger than the one we have at home. The mattress is very thin but in two weeks in Italy at 4 places we never had a box spring. Next time, I think we will try for a quieter place.",
            "Monti is a \"little village\" in the middle of Rome, and there, in on of the charming, narrow streets, You find Hotel Grifo. On a trip to Rome five years ago we passed this lovely looking hotel and decided to stay there the next time, which we did in nov. 2008. On their website i\u00b4d read that the top floors had their own terrace and therefore i ordered one of them. Still, I hadnt actually been indside the hotel and therefore i coldnt be sure that the photos told the right story. They did. High expectations is a dangerous thing, but Grifo fulfilled our hopes for a romantic weekend. And more too. We felt instantly at home. The service was excellent and the room was very nice. We will stay there the next time too, thats for sure.",
            "Hotel Grifo was by far one of the best hotel experiences I have encountered in Europe! The hotel staff went beyond the call of duty and the rooms were spotless! The staff were very helpful with information about the city along with terrific suggestions on sights and restaurants. The Location was Excellent. They are only a few blocks from the Colosseum and within walking distance to all major attractions. Had a lovely time here ;)",
            "We spent a week in Rome at the Grifo hotel! It\u00b4s a fantastic little hotel in the middle of lovely Rome. You`ll get the most excellent service and as a bonus you can rest, from walking along daytime, on their green roof-terrace in the evenings. Every day you return to a clean room and if it\u00b4s hot outside, you\u00b4ll have AC inside.",
            "Great location, centrally located within the ruins we so wanted to visit. We stayed on the 4th floor. The room was large enough to accomodate us, although faintly moldy, and we had to purchase allergy medication in the nearby pharmacy on our first day to endure our spore allegies. When the terrace door would be open we would smell a natural gas escape, immediately nearby, so we kept it shut as much as possible. Other than that, and the minor city block-wide electricity failure (hardly within Hotel Grifo's power) we were delighted to be hosted by such wonderful staff as Louigie, Alessandro, Angela and of course our great Rosa, who took care of us even before we arrived to Rome.",
            "I knew that we chose the Hotel Grif because of its central location and affordable rates. The rooms were moderate to very small in size but clean. We ended up staying near the roof top deck which was the best part of the stay. However, we did have to share a bathroom with the rest of the hall--a very negative experience given that the cleaning lady banged on the door and yelled one time when I took a shower. They also are not too keen on those who choose to take advantage of the nightlife, despite the advertisement that it has a 24 hour bar. They were accomodating to some extent because they gave guests wine and beer from a 3 foot bench but that was only if we could summon the desk clerk over to assist. Our group checked out on time and the staff was basically friendly, especially at breakfast. The only drawback is that once we returned from our trip, someone from our group was emailed by the Hotel Grif and advised that he was being charged an extra 57 euros for a late check out and for not checking his bill--both claims are false and I believe he is contesting the bill. Overall, the hotel is family friendly and clean but I would not stay there again if given the opportunity.",
            "just back from 2 night stay at grifo went with my daughter so booked family triple room it's actually 2 seperate rooms so even better than i thought! ( roof terrace as well.) bathroom was spotless as were the rooms breakfast is fine cereal,coffee,tea ,juice, variety of breads etc. special mention to allesandro and rosa who were so helpful (had a very slight problem with a room key but taken care of while we were out )the cleaning staff great too! All the top sights are within walking distance(maybe not st peters but use the hop on hop off bus) no problems in a fantastic city and a brilliant hotel .",
            "We had a great four days staying at the apartment which is just up the road from the hotel, the hotel has got two great plus points, the location and the staff, the main gentleman Alassandro in particular was always on hand for tips and advice to make the most of Rome, in particular eating out. The apartment was adaquate and quirky, it's in a old cobbled street which has a violin maker opposite and a artist underneth, there is also a busy club next door so it was noisy at night. All this didn't effect our stay just a reminder that we were staying in a busy part of the city. If you want a central, cost friendly staff in Rome Grifo should be on your list .",
            "Hotel Grifo is a good hotel in a great location of Rome. Our room was simple yet very clean and comfortable. A very nice feature is the outdoor terrace on the 4th floor - it really is charming and relaxing after walking around Rome all day. In addition to being in a great location, the staff at the Hotel Grifo was the best ever! Everyone was so willing to help in anyway possible.",
            "We arrived and the staff was extremely friendly. We had arrived in Rome by plane around 9:30am and arrived at the hotel around 11am. The check-in time is not until the afternoon and they allowed us to check-in, drop off our bags, and wash up. This was gladly appreciated after 15 hours of travel time. Also, I would like to compliment the hotel on their complimentary breakfast. The coffee was great and they always accomodated us when we were early or late. The breakfast was enough to hold us over until lunch. Our linens were always fresh everyday. However, the beds are not to be desired but we don't stay in our beds very long on vacation. We get up in the morning and are usually gone all day. They have a few restuarants right around the corner that have the best pizza and customer service. It also is 2 blocks from the Coloseum and metro. They also have a change box down the street that gave us great rates when exchanging cash for euro which I recommend cause the commercial ones will give horrible exchange rates and charge commission. The last day the clerk called for a taxi for us. It was only 5 euro more than taking the train. We had a wonderful time and a lot of it is do to the great stay at Hotel Grifo. I definitely recommend this hotel as long as you don't care about the extra amendities. The staff was awesome. Oh, they also speak and write great English. I had emailed them a week before our arrival. They emailed me back promptly and understandable.",
            "We stayed here for three nights to start our week-long trip in Italy. The staff at the desk was always friendly and helpful with our many questions. Our room was the largest of our trip, with a fully functioning A/C unit. We never had any issue with street noise. The bed was a bit stiff. Unfortunately, we discovered this in all 3 hotels during our trip, so we assumed it was par for the course in Italy. Breakfast was ok, and also ended up being on par with the other hotels. It was good, nothing great though. The shower stall was also a bit tight (i'm slightly smaller than \"Average\"), again something we discovered in all of our hotels. Location wise, we were just minutes from the Colosseum and Ancient Rome. The neighborhood had plenty of charm and character. Many local restaurants and gelatterias to chose from. We never had any issue with street noise, and we always felt safe walking around. The Metro was also only a few steps away. For the price and location, the value was definitely there. We were pleased with our stay and would go back.",
            "My boyfriend and i were so excited to find our hotel located only 5 mins away from the colosseum- the reason we were so intent on visiting Rome in the first place! The hotel is down a lovely atmospheric street and is in the heart of the city, there are restaurants galore and so many things to see and do in the city so close by. Our room was basic but comfortable, had a great shower and was lovely to watch the world pass by out of our window. breakfast was good- you need it with so much to do and see during the day! The staff helped us whenever we needed it and were warm and friendly.We felt very safe and happy the whole time we vitisted the city and had just a wonderful time.",
            "Hotel Grifo was a nice, comfortable, clean & reasonably priced place to stay in Rome. The location is great, and 10 min walk to Colosseum. The hotel is on a quiet street in Rome, with several excellent restaurants within a two block radius. The showers are a little dinky as other people commented on, but after three weeks in Italy, they seemed normal! !",
            "My boyfriend and I are a younger couple and were traveling on a budget, and in Rome it is very hard to find a hotel that would not blow a hole in our wallets. But we were very lucky to come across Hotel Grifo. It is in the heart of everything and in a good area. The location is actually quite amazing! You can practically see the Collosium down the street! It is nestled in a tiny street where it is very nice and quiet. When we first arrived there (earlier than our check-in time), the man at the counter was very curtious and spoke English very well. He told us our room was already prepared for us and it was on the thrid floor, which is the highest. It is a smaller hotel but very cozy and welcoming. Our room was not the largest, but for two people who just need a place to sleep and shower, it was perfect. We had a television and a mini-fridge. The rooms are very clean and well kept. Everyday they make the rooms for you. They serve free breakfast in the morning, which was lovely. It included crossants, toast, yougurt, meat, cheese, juice, and cereal. Just enough to gather your energy for a long day of walking. The people that work at Hotel Grifo were all very friendly and helpful. They gave great recomendations for resturants and things to see. I would defintely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a pleasant and casual hotel room. It is really great for couples. It is no luxery hotel, but it is more than you expect for the price you pay.",
            "Grifo is a very cozy, friendly, clean and well situated hotel few steps from the coloseum. Among the three hotels we stayed at in Italy, Grifo was the best! The hotel is well situated in a very nice and historic neighborhood with restaurrants, pubs and places to visit. It is few steps from the coloseum and worth the extra you would pay in being a little further from the train station. It has a personal touch and you can see it in the care given to the place. The people at the reception are very very friendly and helpful! Last, it has interesting surprises, like a terrace in some of the rooms that makes you feel just at home!",
            "We spent two nights at Hotel Grifo after a two week cruise. The hotel is located within walking distance to top \"must see\" sightseeing in Rome. The neighborhood is friendly and safe. The rooms are small but very clean and adequate. There was a daily continental breakfast included in the cost of the room. But the most outstanding item in this hotel is the staff !! They were the most pleasant, informative and helpful of any place I have ever stayed. If ......when I go back to Rome it will definitely include a stay at Hotel Grifo.",
            "From the moment we entered this charming little hotel in the heart of Rome we new we had picked a gem. After registering, the clerk at the front desk took the time to go over the sites that we should see and marked them on a map (provided by the hotel). She also sold us a Roma Pass which was valid for 3 days, covering public transportation and free or discounted entry to Roman sites. TRAVEL TRIP: Buy the Roma Pass. We left our bags (the room was not yet available at 11:00am, no problem) and off we went. The Colosseum, Forum, and Capital Hill are all within easy walking distance from the hotel. Upon returning to the hotel we were pleasantly surprised to find that our luggage had been delivered to our room. We hadn't received this service before. The room was small, but comfortable. Even though the shower was small, it had the best shower head that we found anywhere in our 30 day adventure in Europe. The hotel also had an elevator, something a lot of the smaller hotels do not have. The hotel provided a nice breakfast to start the day off with; warm croissants, nutella, cheese, fruit, sliced ham and turkey, cereal, coffee, juice and milk. The hotel is located not far from the Cavour Metro Station, so it was easy to find. We found that the public transportation in Rome was excellent and bus 19 came right by the hotel's front door. Restaurants were plenty in the area and we found the area safe to walk at night. We would defintely stay here again!",
            "We had only one night to stay in Rome, and were looking for a nice clean hotel close to the sites in ancient Rome. This place fit the bill, but had a few drawbacks. Pros: * the front desk staff was very nice and had lots of tips for getting around Rome and making the most of our short time there. they also reserved a private car transfer to the airport for 50 euros. * it's clean. * close to Colosseum, but far enough away that you feel like you're in a real Roman neighborhood away from the tourist hordes. Cons: * way overpriced (150 euros) for what it's worth. i've stayed at a 5-star hotels for the same price. * neighborhood traffic is noisy at night. * ancient lock on the door opens with a skeleton key. doesn't feel very secure. * toilet operates strangely, shower door difficult to close. * thin walls - you can hear other guests walking up and down the stairs. We left early in the morning, so we didn't get to enjoy the breakfast. Maybe that would have made up for the other shortcomings.",
            "We stayed in this hotel one night, I higly recomend this hotel for budget travelers and families with children - it is in walking distance from Station Termini - about 20 min. OK - room was tiny, but clean, bathroom in the room, breakfast nice. Reception staff - very frendly, giving a map, trying to answer any question, giving suggestion for dinning.",
            "Location is absolutely perfect for exploring the historical center of Rome and even night life in Trastevere is just 40 minutes walk (through the illuminated historical center) away. The first time we got there we missed the right turn and in a few seconds ended up looking at Colosseum :) Late evening and night walks are pleasant and pretty safe. Right around the corner were tiny jazz recording studio, musical instrument's workshop and another small workshop where the guy was making copies of ancient roman clothes and armour. There also were qutie a few good restaurants (including cheap but very good Chinese and Indian if you're tired of pasta and pizza) and vinoteca around. Although it isn't by any means some posh hotel the staff were extremely receptieve to our needs and wishes like we were some VIP guests :) It was very helpfull for us that they were also very knowledgeable (Alexandro's tip about Vatican museums saved us hours spent waiting in line) and could speak several languages (including Russian) at least at some basic lavel. Although our room was rather small, it was clean and neat, the bed was very wide and comfortable and there were enough place in wardrobe for all our stuff. It could be a bit noisy - you're not completely safe from noise coming from neighbouring rooms and corridors - but at least the street is absolutelly quiet at night. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, felt that we got what we paid for and then some and therefore would definitely recomend this hotel.",
            "Great stuff (especially Alessandro... he is great, he speaks several langugages, he know where, when and how to explore wonderful city...). Good breakfast for that kind (star) hotel. Great place to start or complete daily sightseeing, lot's of small shops, restaurants... Actually, you don't need public trasport for lot's of sights... or dinner, or store... But, it's close to metro station on B line (one stop to Termini), close to bus station on Via Nazionale... From Termini station you can walk 10-15 min (well, Rome is on the several hills... :D )... 10 minutes walkign to Colosseum, or Forum Romanum... Clean room, fresh towels every day, small shampoo, AirCondition... italian TV, but TV :)"
