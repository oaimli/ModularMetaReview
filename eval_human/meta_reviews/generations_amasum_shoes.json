            "I'm a serious runner. Qualified for the Boston Marathon three times and ran that beast this past April in what was their worst weather conditions in their history. I love my Mizuno Wave Rider 22! Let me tell ya, this pair is awesome! I run long and hard and these shoes are made for running! Get some!",
            "I went through 8 different shoes/returns until I found these shoes. I do Orangetheory avidly and it was really difficult for me to find a shoe for rowing/running/lifting! I am happy to say this one was the ticket. I love the look too! I will say, I bought these shoes, and inserts because I have tender feet and a high arch. I ended up returning the inserts because the shoe itself had all the cushion I needed.",
            "Listed as one of the best cushioned running shoes. 1/2 to 1 size smaller. The cushion is very comfortable, everything is soft and just right. The shape of the shoes also. Near perfect for my feer if my feet were not wide. Choose W, the label was D. This W/ D is just like M.",
            "Have worn Wave Riders for probably 12 years. This model 22 is not good. The white Mizuno roadrunner logo on outer shoe is way too stiff. I think what has happened is the logo is slightly more toward the toe box and therefore hits my foot at the outer little toe. Will have to return them. Way too much blister potential. Plus it actually hurts! Not comfortable at all. Sadness.",
            "Nice support, BUT i have wide & bunion feet & the D (wide), is NOT that wide. I wear 9.5, but even that was a bit snug. I like Mizunos, but like Hokas, they run narrow!!",
            "I just love the wave rider! This is my 4th shoe in the wave rider. I started with the wave rider 19 and was blown away by how much it changed my running, injuries I had and overall comfort for my joints. (I have \"flat feet\".) The 22 is just as exceptional as the first one I bought. Comfort continues to get nothing but better and I'm loving the look.",
            "These appear to be knock offs and not the real Mizuno wave riders that I have purchase from a local store. No wonder the CHEAP price. Returned for refund.",
            "This is my 5th pair of Waverunners. I love them. I have a narrow foot with a high arch & these shoes hug my foot & give sufficient support. I\u2019d recommend stepping up 1/2 a size as they run slightly small. I\u2019m not a runner, but I do a lot of walking & cross training. And they\u2019re perfect for that. I\u2019m also glad they came in all black. For many years they only came in bright colors that weren\u2019t to my liking.",
            "Pros: 1. no break-in period 2. great cushioning and support 3. can be worn with or without socks, depending on your activity Cons 1. my right toe rubs up on the upper, but not enough to be uncomfortable 2. due to above, this shoe runs a half size smaller Recommendation: I'm not an avid runner, so this shoe works well for both power walking and running. The color is conservative and fits that lifestyle.",
            "Wife very very happy with these shoes.. This is her 2nd pair.. She wore them to Disneyland to break in.. infact we brought another \"worn in \"pair of shoes to switch into if needed,, She never wore her other shoes.. From the box to her feet and that day we walked 7.2 miles and 17920 steps.. Shoes are comfortable well made, nice color, and great fit !!! Wife vey happy and you will be too.. Theme Park tested amd approved",
            "Have worn Wave Rider for years and loved the fit -- was perfect for my arch. Apparently some changes have been made, and the 22's don't seem to have the same fit as my old 18's. Appears they decreased the arch height, which also causes my left foot to move around too much in the shoe. I've compensated by tying it a little tighter. I was just a bit disappointed because my previous 3 pairs (back to 12) had fit so perfectly.",
            "I did not realize how many different and confusing choices there are in Mizuno running shoes. I bought the wrong model and tried to wear them into comfortable. They just got worse. So I looked carefully at the number, \"Waverider 22.\" Luckily they are still making them and I was able to order a pair in the gorgeous purple. I wore them all through our trip to Vienna. They were great and looked very chic with all the black clothes I brought to wear. I implore Mizuno to keep making the model I am so sick of athletic shoe companies dropping models of sneakers and sandals.",
            "These look nice but are so small! I usually wear a 10.5 and these are so tight I don't think an 11 will even fit. Very disappointed because the black looks really nice.",
            "I had hoped the Wave Rider 22s would be like the 21s (because I love, love, love them), but they're not. The band/seam between the top of the laces and the bottom of the toe-box is too tight and, quite frankly, painful. I returned them the next day.",
            "They changed the toe box. It\u2019s too narrow for me now. I tried to size up but then the piece on the side was too tight and rubbed my foot. I hope the next version is better because I loved this shoe before.",
            "I am one of the select few with high arches that also supinates (roles on the outside of my feet). I have had these shows for 3 weeks and been on two longish runs (9-10 miles each) and several shortish 4 miles. So far my feet love me and it feels like I am running on a cloud. I will update as I get more miles under my belt. One frustration I typically have is that the tread on the outside wears out well before the life of the shoe should. I am hoping these treat me better!",
            "Although these aren't quite as cushioning and light as the previous mizuno wave prophecy sneakers i purchased, they are still a quality, comfortable shoe. The only downside is the large open space in the heal of the sole which is welcoming to rocks that are part of all landscapes in Arizona. So, often I have to pull one out that gets stuck. I wish i could afford the 220. top of the line mizuno- they really are the best. But for a 100.00 this is a quality shoe that will do the trick if you require cushion for high arches and plantar fasciitis.",
            "This is my 8th pair of Mizuno Wave Riders! I won't wear anything else for running. Great fit. Can easily run multiple miles in these shoes on day of purchase. Don't need to break them in!",
            "Great shoe Comfortable and good cushioning and fits wider foot well which I appreciate",
            "The support inside and outside is great. Yet, these are lightweight and breathe. My left shoe fits like a glove in the 11 Wide. My right foot is bigger and is a tiny bit more snug, but I still think I picked the right size. I am planning on doing a half marathon in May and have to prepare to train. My feet feel great in these shoes. The reviews that people sent helped me choose these. Several people who do marathons said they loved these shoes. I see why. Thanks",
            "I had worn out a previous model of the Wave Rider that I really liked. There weren't any to be had in town so I took a chance and ordered a pair. I ordered the violet and liked them so ordered another pair in black. They are lightweight, comfortable, true to size and I would obviously order them again!",
            "I have had a several of these same shoes in other models. I loved the 15, not the 17 and 18's. These have changed and better then the past few models. I wish loved the harder souls rather than the cushioned ones. They seem more durable and are more comfortable for my supination.",
            "So maybe one 5k in the shoes, right out of the box isn't enough time to tell, but...they were amazing. My right foot runs a little bigger than my left...I thought for a moment about returning for a 7 instead of 6.5 but then I knew it would be too big on my left. I decided to give it a try. I have trouble with plantar fasciitis and heel Spurs,but my feet did not hurt one bit. As a matter of fact, had my fastest time. Coincidence? I think not.",
            "These were ok, but did not feel like quality material. I was trying to replace my favorite brand with these. Love the colors, which my favorite brand has the most dead boring colors. I loved the color choices. The comfort was not there for me. Not a flexible material. Not much padding. These are my choice for color not comfort. I ordered a 1/2 size larger than normal, it kinda rubbed spots. I am diabetic, so I am very picky.",
            "I have been running in Mizuno shoes for years. I was recommended Mizuno's by a specialty running store and have been buying them for years. I won't run in anything else. Great quality shoe with a supportive, high arch.",
            "I've used this brand several times in the past, yet this shoe makes my feet fall asleep. Can't use them for running. :( Someone else who had the same shoe also has the same problem. Is the tongue too thick? I even tried different lacing techniques. It's weird.",
            "I am very pleased with these shoes. Lightweight, well-balanced, great support, and very attractive (love the colors.) Exactly what I wanted! I don't run, but like running shoes because they are not heavy like walking shoes. This is my 1st purchase of Mizuno, will probably not be my last.",
            "I work on my feet 12 hour shifts, and have loved the support of Mizuno Wave Rider 15, however, this newer version crowded and reddened my outer toes and just plain hurt after only 4 hours. These are 11's and fit more like a 10. A co-worker admired the look of them, I gave them to her, she wears a 9 1/2 and she says they fit perfectly.",
            "They are light, fit perfectly, and are so comfortable for running! I feel that I can eve run longer with them! After half a year, they are as good as new.",
            "Great heel cushioning but terrible ankle support. If u r looking for both I recommend the Mizuno Wave inspire not these. I bought them for gym but not the ideal shoes for gym. They are comfortable far as cushioning in shoes that's about the only positive thing I like about these shoes.",
            "Love them! I have supinated feet with extremely high arches. These give me all relief and work well with all my different fitness activities! Best shoes for me!",
            "Comfortable fit. Like the slight stretch in the laces too. Glad I ordered the wide- needed it. I did skip the first lacing hole due to my wide bunion feet. Have done this with other running shoes too- helps it fit better.",
            "Love these shoes. The pair I ordered had a defect in the seem on the left shoe so I returned them and bought the same shoe again elsewhere. Feel great no puckered seem.",
            "Love the colors. Very comfortable and supportive. I walk 2-3 miles a day in them. My only issue is that the space in the middle of the heel is the perfect size to trap sweetgum balls. It\u2019s a Southern thang!",
            "Decided to start running again and get back to mizunos. These are very lightweight, comfortable and the gray color with blue looks awesome",
            "I always order this kind of running shoe. They last a long time and are great for arch support. I have flat feet and refuse to buy any other brand than mizuno. I\u2019ve tried others and ended up with hip issues. The price is well worth the use you get out of them.",
            "Best fitting walking shoe I\u2019ve ever owned even better then my Hokas",
            "This is usually my brand with zero problems right out of the box, but this pair is unusually tight in the toe box, causing some toe pain on longer runs. It may just be a bad pair-I love this brand.",
            "I've used Wave Riders for the past decade, and this pair, specifically the right shoe, just isn't quite right. It took a few runs to figure it out, but it's a little too small and the fit causes my arch to ache and spasm. I've never had this issue before so I wouldn't buy this again.",
            "I wanted these to fit so badly. They are narrow and short, so I ordered a full size up. The size was okay but the shoes felt a little stiff and not a lot of cushion. Sadly, I had to return these. They did not work for me but I'm sure many people would love these.",
            "I purchased the wide width, but they are very snug; not as comfortable as compared to other wide width athletic shoes I\u2019ve purchased in the past. However, they have good support and great cushion.",
            "I run every day and these shoes have quality and durable materials that last an entire year! These shoes fit well and I DON'T have to order a \"wide\" even though I have a bit of a wider foot. Also, it took about 3 weeks to a month to break in.",
            "The fit is as expected, the comfort is exceptional, the running feel is sturdy and balanced, and the walking feel is comfortable. Everything is excellent, and it looks truly incredible.",
            "I had a good experience with Mizuno wave rider but I was concerned about the grip for wet surfaces as my previous Mizuno Wave Rider were not very good in wet surfaces but this model has good grip and it's better than the previous model. These days a 90% of my runs are trail and I am very pleased with this shoes.",
            "I have been wearing this shoe for a while and just love it. I am very sad that Mizuno has discontinued this version of their running shoe line.",
            "I previously had the 19 model. Fits similar to those. I feel Mizuno always runs a bit small so I order Up about a half size. Very comfortable in my opinion. I know They are running shoes but I wear them at work as a nurse for 12+ hours",
            "Like running on clouds! These shoes have been great while working out and running! They don\u2019t hurt my bunion issues which is why I bought this style after googling which shoe is best for bunions. I sized up a full size and they\u2019re perfect! Will plan to buy again after these wear down a bit.",
            "Always my favorite running shoe, but since this one also comes in black, I can wear it to work with my uniform as well. It doubles as both a running shoe and work shoe for me, and it\u2019s great for both.",
            "Great running shoe. I had to wear these right out of the box for a 12 mile run. They were comfortable and kept up with me. I didn\u2019t even get any blisters! These are my 3rd pair of Mizunos and I will be buying more!!",
            "Gotten several shoes from this seller Fast shipping, great prices, lots of colors to choose from",
            "This is my fourth pair of Mizuno wave riders. Obviously, I love this running shoe but buying them new can be really expensive. Found a new pair of an older edition that were ~$40 cheaper than buying the newest edition; arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Will buy from vendor again!",
            "This shoe is fairly similar to my old Wave Riders. The cushioning is a little softer but still has the responsive feel that I really liked with the old models. The heel is a little thicker than in past models too, but it doesn't seem to be too cumbersome. Overall, they feel great, and I'm really happy with them.",
            "When I ran my first marathon, the store I went to specialized in running shoes. They fitted me with the Mizuno Wave Rider. I've been hooked ever since. There are a LOT of amazing shoe brands, and I've tried to buy beyond Mizuno over the years, but for my feet, with high arches, this shoe gives the best overall support.",
            "Fits perfectly. I have flat feet and supinate, but I like to run. I need good arch support and heel support. These shoes are incredible",
            "I'm a longtime Mizuno wearer. These shoes fit my somewhat wide foot well, have good cushioning, not too clunky.",
            "They were just ok. I\u2019ve ran in the same style but was the men\u2019s and for some reason the women\u2019s aren\u2019t near as cushy. I was a bit disappointed",
            "These shoes fit perfectly and feel good even at the end of a 13 hour work day. They are not to hot or cold, and have just the right amount of cushioning. I love these shoes!!",
            "I love these shoes, good neutral shoe for on trail or road. This is probably my fifth or sixth pair of the wave rider line, I've run races and every day in them.",
            "Fit is good. Good support. Looks good. Laces tie well, even with the extended loop at the top. I mainly do weights in a gym, not much running. Have not used them outside.",
            "Great support, plenty of space in the toe box, no break in time necessary.",
            "Love these shoes, second pair of wave runners. Perfect for supination.",
            "Great running shoe and everyday shoe. I\u2019m a medical professional, I\u2019m on my feet all day. I have one pair for running and one pair for work. Super comfy, great support!!",
            "Love Mizuno! Measured foot, read fitting chart, no problems with size.",
            "Nothing fancy about these shoes. They are heavy when running - went back to my ASICS nimbus!",
            "i have been running in Mizunos for years and love the wave rider. some of the different updates have not worked for me, but this edition is great and the shoe has good flexibility while giving enough arch support. the toe has enough room not to crunch my toes without being too boxy either.",
            "Nice cushy shoe. First time I wore them I wore them all day. My plantar fasciitis didn\u2019t flare up at all and I didn\u2019t get any blisters. Worth the price.",
            "These fit to size but have zero cushion. My ankles and arches are extremely sore after wearing them. I missed the return date by a week, otherwise I would have returned these shoes.",
            "This shoe is great for high arches and the Wide is good for slightly wide feet. The best shoe I have found for my feet in a very long time. Thanks Mizuno!",
            "I have plantar fasciitis and was told to buy these. I love them",
            "I love these shoes. I'm on my feet all day and they have really helped lessen my foot pain. Very comfortable and look good. Only con is I should have gotten a half size larger. Other than that, they have exceeded expectations!",
            "Love them. They're very comfortable and well structured to provide a ton of support.",
            "I love Mizuno but this incarnation of the Wave Rider did not do it for me. The toe box was significantly longer than all my other Mizunos of the same size. They just were not as comfortable either.",
            "Perfect fit and very comfortable to wear. Plan to order another pair net month.",
            "Ran these the day of a half marathon, after a few months of training in ASICS and they did not let me down. So happy with these, light weight and super supportive!",
            "The Mizuno (size 8) I ordered is perfectly fit to me. I can\u2019t be wrong with the size I order. This is the only brand works for my feet. I work at the retail comp., and my job have to much walk around the store. I highly recommended this brand, specially if you do have a deep arch like I do.",
            "Best shoes ever! Fit great and Mizuno's last forever. Customer for life here.",
            "I\u2019ve been wearing Mizuno Wave riders for years, and this is my 5th or 6th pair. They got as expected and are as comfortable as always.",
            "These are my go to running shoe always and forever!!!",
            "I absolutely love these shoes. I bought another pair because they are so comfortable and supportive.",
            "Tried a lot of shoes but this shoe is by far the most comfortable. Well padded and good support.",
            "Just what my bride needed to train for her next marathon!",
            "Brooks Ghost has always been my preferred running shoe. Thought I\u2019d try the Mizunos! If you are a neutral as far as fit, these are great.",
            "Use for running and so far so good. They are very comfortable.",
            "Great fit. Great support, lightweight everything I want in an athletic shoe.",
            "I've had them for about 3 weeks now and I love them for work! Great support and feels like I'm walking on a cloud! I have narrow feet with high arches and these are super comfy! I ordered my normal size in running shoes which is a 7.",
            "These are the most comfortable shoes! They don't have to be \"worn in\" to feel great. I ran a 5K immediately after purchasing them and my feet felt great. I don't want to take them off!",
            "I do a lot of Treadmill walking. These shoes are very comfortable and don\u2019t make my feet burn like other sneakers do. I normally wear a size 7 shoe and ordered these in an 8. Fit perfectly.",
            "Love this product they're one of the best shoes I've ever bought.",
            "A gift for my daughter, she loves them. They fit great and offer great support. Love the pretty color, too.",
            "I've been running in mizunos for a number of years now and after an initial fitting in a store, I always purchase online. I haven't had any issues with fit doing it this way.",
            "My second pair of this style and still is the best-fitting and comfortable sneaker that I have ever tried.",
            "These are the most comfortable, well-made shoes I have ever bought. I just ordered another pair.",
            "It has very attractive styling. I use it for walking the neighborhood and for everyday use.",
            "I use to buy Asics but I love Muzino now",
            "I have worn this shoe all 22 years. It\u2019s the best fit for me and never disappoints.",
            "I've always loved Mizuno Wave Riders and am so thrilled to find that they're still great! I have a narrow foot and Mizuno's have always fit me perfectly. Love these shoes - I like the gray color as well!",
            "Its very comfortable shoes I've been wearing over 15 years.It was great deal and looking forward to use it many activities as well.thanks.",
            "Well cushioned and comfortable. I've been buying Wave Riders since 2010 and these are the quality I've come to know and love in the Mizuno brand.",
            "Best shoes ever and the only brand that fits me",
            "Not my favorite version of the wave rider. The heel doesn\u2019t seem to go up quite as high as my others.",
            "Fits like I expected, if you ever had Mizunos before of Waveriders get the same size. Awesome blue color and great arch support. My favorite brand!",
            "A little narrow in the front but once broken in there was no issue. Super comfortable and offers really good ankle support",

            "Overall, I want to say these shoes fit great and are incredibly comfortable. I find myself wearing them both at the gym and just hanging out. The first day they were quite tight, but now have formed to my foot and are a great fit. My only warning is to be careful where you step with these shoes, as the color shows dirt very easily and the material is not very easy to clean.",
            "I love these shoes! Plus they add about 2in in height. If your looks for shoes to make you feel tall. So it will take some getting used too it flats and thinner shoes. The Saucony Grid 9000 are big bulky shoes. Pretty light tho. I ordered size 10 Men and they fit more like a size 11. I have two others pairs I got in store which fit more like 10 then these do. Still love them tho. They color looked amazing and they are very comfortable.",
            "Excellent product!!! My first Saucony pair of shoes ever. ( coming originally from Europe has been a big fan of Adidas. Puma and then US brands such as Nike, Asics, Reebok, New Balance erc.) Long story short these shoes are so fantastic that I already purchased a 'test' pair of different model for my daughter in Florida and after completing this review about to order two more pairs of '9000's' for my myself before they disappear \ud83d\ude1b",
            "Amazing shoes!!! Great buy if you are a casual runner or need something to support your foot and act as a great \" go to places \" shoe. Honestly, I have tried addidas pure boost as my brother has the same size foot as me, and has Addidas Pure Boosts for 11.5, so I tried them, they were really uncomfortable, these Grid 9000 are so much more confortable, have higher quality materials, and are over half the price of his Addidas. Good buy for really anyone. Rich or Poor, these shoes are a great buy.",
            "Shoes are comfortable and should break in well. I'm not in love with the design of the tongue. Attached on one side rather than a full \"sock\" sort of style. Moves to the left as you walk and I find I am constantly pulling it back to center to keep the padding fully across the top of my foot.",
            "These shoes look super cool and would be so incredibly comfortable, except...what I think is supposed to be the arch support starts almost at the heel. I supinate and have very high arches, but would have kept these if those arch \"bumps\" didn't make my feet cramp back there. Do some people really have arches that far back?",
            "I'm a wide 8.5 in women's- I have had bunyans from birth. I always worry about narrow work out shoes, so I tried this men's pair, and a size 7 fits me perfectly. The colors are also just as you see in the picture!! They arrived quite quickly and are high quality. The tongue of the shoe is attached to the left side on the left shoe and the right side on the right shoe, but it doesn't bother me and I haven't had any issues with the tongue sliding over. Overall, in love with this purchase!!!",
            "Great value at the price I paid. Bought these nearly a year ago and I still have them, still in great shape. Saucony's are making a comeback and I understand why. They look really rice and offer really unique colorways. At the prices offered, it wouldn't be hard to build up a collection of several different \"models\" and colorways for all sorts of different feelings, outfits, days, whatever. Would recommend.",
            "Great shoes for walking, providing good arch support. Very comfortable for all day wear. After having two partial knee replacements my running days are over but I needed a good walking shoe. Saucony running shoes worked for me for years but I didn't want to spend well over $100 for a walking shoe. This shoe meets all my needs.",
            "Stylish and comfortable. Unique tongue but very versatile shoe. Hard to clean though",
            "Best sneakers/runners I have ever had. So disappointed that Saucony has discontinued the Shadow 6000.",
            "I purchased these sneakers for my Boyfriend for Christmas. He already has this same style in other colors so he knew his size. They Fit him perfectly and The mint color is so fresh and cool they look great! A little disappointed they did not arrive on time for Christmas but happy with the sneakers. I suggest knowing your size in this brand as certain sneaker brands can run differently.",
            "Very pleased with the item and so comfortable I will but my second pair",
            "So I opened up these shoes to reveal that they are awesome! Tried them on, extremely comfortable, but something is wrong. Can't quite place it but I can just feel it. I take a look at the shoe tags; I received the correct size for my left foot (12) but for my right foot I have received a size 13. Other than that product is as expected. Trying to figure out how to get correct shoe to me and what I need to do with the wrong shoe. Any help?",
            "These are a perfect fit. I really am happy I made this purchase. The price was right and the fit is snug, comfy and tight!",
            "Awesome color and shoe! Fits perfect and would highly recommend.",
            "the 9000 came out in the mid 90's and is still one of the best daily runner there is. 2 miles MWF on asphalt and they hold up as well as they did in the Army! VERY WELL WORTH THE $$$",
            "A little tight. Very comfortable still. Order half a size up or a size up",
            "Normally wear an 11, that's what I ordered. A little bit roomy but still very wearable, however I could have gone a half size down to a 10.5. Anyways, I got the mint colorway, and it POPS! looks absolutely fantastic and this is one of the most comfortable, if not THE most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. Amazing for the price. Highly recommend!",
            "These are quite comfy but the sole is a bit noisy as it is a bit rigid. The shoe tongue is attached to one side of the shoe and looks a bit weird with shorts, it isn't noticeable with long pants.",
            "I have had them for awhile in box. Wore them maybe 5 Times. Sneaker head so kicks only come up here and there. I\u2019ve noticed on both shoes black marks appearing on both tips of shoes. Terrible!!!! Won\u2019t be coming out of box again. Pissed!!!",
            "A bit tight on my left foot which is wider than my right. I wish Saucony had wide sizing on their originals line. Although the Jazz has a better fit for wide feet. Bulkier but not a bad shoe. Should've opted a simpler black color/white sole version.",
            "A great pair of sneakers at a reasonable price. Would buy again.",
            "I get more compliments on these shoes. Ordered since our school colors. Love these shoes and the price was super!",
            "Really love these shoes. They have become one of my top 3 pairs of shoes ever. Fit was perfect, color was perfect, everything was perfect. Going to order another pair soon.",
            "I'm 67 years old and I have problems with my knees and feet so to get good shoes never have been easy. These are my first Saucony shoes. I wore them and as soon as I did I felt so much comfortable. I can tell they are the best shoes ever I have wore in my 67 year. I wear them everyday for 8 hours and they are awesome. I need another pair",
            "Grid 9000's are soooooo comfy!! Love the clean look and color of this shoe.",
            "amazing. the color just makes it so much appealing and they are beyond comfortable",
            "My 4th pair of sauconys but my first Grid 9000s. I love the inner cushioning and lining. Super soft and squishy like those gel wrist pads you have on mouse pads. Similar texture. Fits a bit smug and stiff so probably need breaking in. I got the mint green color. Not my first choice for a color but for $20 shipped Can't pass up this deal",
            "Great shoes, very comfortable. Bonus feature: They raise my height by about an inch.",
            "Shoes look and feel great but after a few months of very light use they are falling apart. I won't buy it again unless its a Super deal.aTgey do look good thou.",
            "Fits true to size, very comfortable and a good looking shoe. I'm wearing these as a causal shorts shoe, with the laces not tied all the way up & with the large tounge, make these shoes look awesome!",
            "so very comfortable. Im impressed that after all these years after this design was new in the 90's, the comfort level is still top notch even by today's standards. Love me some Saucony runners.",
            "What more could i ask for..my girl says i look so good in these..she loves them so damn much!",
            "I love the color combination of these sneakers and their comfort",
            "I have an old pair of these that I use for yard work. They are very comfortable and fit great. The build is sturdy and tough, and the sole is very supportive.",
            "For the price they're good but mine was a little dirty looks like they been tried on before.",
            "Saucony's are the most comfortable shoe I ever had. Will continue to buy",
            "Wish I would made the exchange for a smaller size.",
            "Well built, I like the shoe. The colors are well coordinated. Size 10 for more like a size 9. Returned it.W",
            "Can't beat a classic! Very comfortable! A retro shoe you can wear casually that looks good and actually feels even better!",
            "i'm a big guy so finding a shoe that I can work in COMFORTABLY was a task...But maybe it has been solved, these shoes are absolutely life saving lol and they are of amazing quality.",
            "They were such a good buy that I couldn't pass them up. My son has a pair that I paid over 90 bucks for. These were a fraction of that!",
            "I have a few pair of the Grid 9000's. Always a comfortable sneaker. These were insanely below retail. Bought them without even hesitating.",
            "Fits great does have an odd tongue though. It is attached to the side of the shoe. Other than that very comfortable.",
            "Saucony does it again leaving me with a weighted shoe that allow all of my 275 lbs to enjoy while running without allowing to much tension on my knees. Great Job once again",
            "Very nice shoe quality is like an 8/10 but they so cheap so u can't really go wrong",
            "The only complaint I have about these is that the synthetic material absorbs dirt very easily, something I don't really care about, but could be a little bit annoying to some. The soles are very thick which is odd, but the shoe is pretty well made and looks good.",
            "Great pricing. Great look. Good purchase. Feel great to the touch.",
            "Great price, great fit, great look. I couldn't ask for more in a pair of shoes.",
            "I love them. They look just as I expected them to look & they fit perfect! The only thing I did see is that they were a little dirty on the toe of the right shoe but I just simply cleaned that with the amazing shoe cleaner that I have, so problem solved!",
            "Fit really well. The arch is low, but I do not have a high arch so they are very comfortable",
            "Loved them we ordered about 9 pairs and we're happy with every single one. Fast shipping as well",
            "Shoes came in great condition, brand new. Only problem was it was a little too small. I ordered a size 9 which is my shoe size but after a while my toes started to ache. Maybe go half a size up if you choose to get these shoes.",
            "This is a fantastic shoe. So comfortable and stylish! I will continue to buy as long as there available in my size.",
            "GREAT SHOE TRUE TO COLOR AND SO COMFY! Im a womens 9 or 9.5 go these in a MENS 8 fits great!",
            "Looks good and was comfortable on my first run. The shoe was laced with the laces twisted, so being somewhat OCD, I had to correct this. The tongue of the shoe is an extension of one side of the shoe, so that felt weird at fist, but I got used to it.",
            "I like the feel of these shoes, the left shoe does feel slightly different than the right, maybe a little less arch in it but they still feel good.",
            "Very comfortable and easy to clean when it gets scuffed",
            "Comfortable shoe and it goes with anything really (I got black and white) the material on the front scuffs easy and is hard to clean though otherwise I really like this shoe",
            "I love this sneaker because they are stylesh and affordable",
            "They fit a little snug but I think once they're broken in they'll be good.",
            "I ordered the wrong size Saucony Grid sneakers. I wear a women's 9.5 and mistakenly ordered a men's 8 when I needed a men's 8.5, which is not in stock. As such, I had to return them because they are too snug. Even if they were the right size, I noticed this is a popular color and style on social media. I am not a fan of wearing the same things as everyone else, so ordering the wrong size actually worked in my favor. They are a comfortable shoe for everyday wear and the colors are very vibrant. They are as depicted.",
            "good shoe doesn't look very good if it gets wet tho. looks great with joggers. please keep em' clean :P",
            "Love these, they fit snug and they don't break the bank.",
            "I love Saucony's and this is the best shoe for me!",
            "80% of the sneakers that I own are Nikes but these Sauconys are on point: comfortable, nice looking and inexpensive. As far as the seller goes, these joints arrived promptly.",
            "look ok on paper but look like grandpa shoes in person and are kind of uncomfortable with the way the toungue is only attached to one side. also the laces that come with it are low quality.",
            "The Grid 9000s are some of the most comfortable sneakers I've ever had the pleasure of finding.",
            "I would Definitely Cop Again. Saucony is a Brand most people don't know much about since people are so caught up in hype.Great Shoe to wear daily and Affodable",
            "Love the comfort and the style. Will definitely buy again!",
            "Love the fit. Comfort with a relaxed sports grid bottom. Great for exercising",
            "Very nice comfortable fit my nephew really love them he asks for another color.",
            "Some of the most comfortable sneakers I've ever had the pleasure to wear. Very versatile and extremely durable for every day use. I'll definitely be buying these again.",
            "Description says they are blue, but they are purple. Still nice shoes and comfortable.",
            "Beautiful Shoe, fly style and super comfortable......I already plotting on my next pair...",
            "Looks nice and clean, very comfortable, true to size, only con is the off white get dirty very easy so take cautious steps!",
            "Very good, I help my friend, she is very love.",
            "\"\" The shoe fits very well \"\" , I am probably going to buy another pair very soon .",
            "I was a little thrown off by the design on the top of the shoe (the tongue is sown in on one side) but they're great. They are fashionable, light weight, give great support, and are basically a slip sneakers. Can't go wrong unless you botch your color choice.",
            "I have narrow feet. Saucony shoes fit me best of all the brands I have tried. I bought an elastic shoe string called Lock Laces to use with the shoes. The combination of shoe and laces are all day comfortable.",
            "First time try Saucony and I like it. will keep trying.",
            "The laces get undone more easily than others that I've owned over the years. Not sure why. Aside from that, they are perfect!",
            "Very nice and comfortable shoe. Inner shoe is plush. Tongue is kinda weird since it's connected on one side but not the other but it's not that big a deal. Great shoe overall!",
            "Shoes are dope but cut to small. Reccomend buying half size bigger than usual.",
            "I took advice from others and ordered 1/2 size larger. I wear 2 pair of socks& the shoe is perfect. A very nice shoe I no longer Jog but these would have been perfect.",
            "Not my first rodeo, with Saucony's! Great looking shoe. Can't wait to rock them!",
            "I wouldn't run in them because I wear them casually",
            "Fit great! An amazing shoe for twice what I paid!!",
            "I got the mint colorway and it was a great buy, it also came in 3 weeks early. I totally recommend to get this shoe it's really comfortable and the color is amazing.",
            "nice and good fit but good be much better on the detail, the shoe itself looks very nice and uniqe the only down side is the detail could be better",
            "Great looking sneakers, I recommend going half-size down as they do run a bit long and by going half size down the fit will be nice and snug with the neoprene providing a sock like fit. Best bang for your buck in terms of shoes imo!",
            "I love these shoes an the colors look so good an they are really comfortable",
            "Love these sneakers. I've had them for just under a month now and it feels like I'm walking on a cloud. The colors really jump out too. I've got the Orange/blue and the gray/mint green pair. Definitely gonna grab some more colors in the near future!!",
            "i like these shoes they're comfy and easy to wear",
            "Fit good looked good but the toe of the left shoe had a small defect",
            "very comfortable. the colors look better in person and that's saying a lot. I will be purchasing more. awesome shoe",
            "Always loved sauconys, and they are hard to find in the stores.",
            "Its a nice kick, it's bulky though so keep that in mind if you got chicken legs like I do..",
            "It is a good shoes and fit as expected ,the appearance\u2018s color is classics,i like it and you should have one!",
            "Great shoes. Comfortable, style on point, and worth every penny. Shoe does run a bit larger so I would recommend sizing down a half size.",
            "My son loves these, fit was ideal and they look great.",
            "I love these shoes so much I ordered another pair soon as these arrived.",
            "The sole is a bit too tall for my liking, but I am willing to forgive that for the awesome style and comfort that comes with these shoes. A great buy.",
            "The light beige part stains rather easily and I have no way of cleaning it.",
            "Product fits exactly as I thought it would. Love these shoes and I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for style and comfort!!",
            "Im true to size in every shoe besides these, i could have gone a half size down",
            "Overall a cool comfortable shoe. I would recommend going true to size.",
            "Awesome shoe for the price. Probably the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. I recommend goin down half a size though, fits somewhat large",
            "Very comfortable being one of my first pairs of sauconys. I like them so much that I've already bought another pair in another style.",
            "at front it's too small i can't fit my fingers(too tight that area)",
            "I ordered these shoes and they are amazing, they fit perfectly and look even better on my feet. They also arrived earlier than expected",
            "Dope, fresh kicks that are comfortable to walk all day in.",
            "Just got mine in and I'm loving them!!!!!! They are so comfortable!!!!!!",
            "Nice! As a sneaker/shoe/fashion lover, I look to branch out and try new things. Saucony did not disappoint me one bit.",
            "Shoes look better in person. They do run big so go half a size down. Very pleased with these I might get another pair",
            "I stand on my feet 10 hours a day at work and I was looking for just the right sneaker. These shoes are just what I needed. They are very light and very breathable. My back, feet, and legs don't hurt at the end if the day anymore, and for that alone I would have paid good money for. I haven't owned a pair of Saucony shoes in years and now I'm wondering why I ever stopped buying them. Saucony definitely has me back as a regular customer again.",
            "I love the color way, and they are a stylish and comfortable sneaker you can wear for almost any occasion",
            "I love it very much... I will recommend to others.",
            "Came fast with the 2 day shipping, as expected. I bought the grey Grid 9000 for my girlfriend to wear to work or the gym or just for everyday \"t shirt & jeans\" wear. I got her a size 6 in Men since she wears a 7.5 in Women & they fit perfect. We never wore Saucony before.. Normally wear Retro Jordan's & Nike so we were a lil skeptical but... She LOVES them. They look good on foot & are super comfortable for all day wear. & they came with an extra pair of laces that match the secondary colors of the shoes so that cool. She even convinced me to get a pair myself.",
            "Very fast shipping very good price. High quality would buy again",
            "THESE EVEN LOOK BETTER TNAN THE PIC. VERY COMFORTABLE TOO.",
            "They run a bit big. I ordered a 12 & can probably go down to 11 1/2.",
            "Great shoes overall, a little tough to drive in but overall great shoes",
            "Great runners that look great with joggers, khakis, or raw denim jeans. They are super comfortable and are way better quality than any nike runner I've owned. Be careful with the mesh though, once you get dirt on these it's hard to wash it out.",
            "Love great fit and very comfortable shoe. Great price for the shoe everywhere else sold them for 120-140.",
            "What can I say, these sneakers far exceeded my expectations! I had never owned a pair of Sauconys before and didn't have the chance to try them on anywhere. I was able to use the fit guide and get a good idea of what size I needed to order. They fit like a glove. I can honestly say this was the easiest most stress free pickup of any of my sneakers. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars comes down to the laces. I would have preferred a different material on them, the current ones tend to come untied unless you double knot em.",
            "The shoes are comfortable, but I was expecting blue and they look more purple.",
            "Great shoes, looks nice and something different from what youll get at retail stores.",
            "Great sneakers. I wish I had 5 pair. Can't wait to buy the show again in another color way",
            "First, let me say these are the first pair of shoes that doesn't look like the picture and that is why I am giving this 2 stars. Still the same great quality of shoe but not the same colour as the picture shown and that's what I was attracted to.",
            "awesome shoe too bad im saving them for a while!!",
            "for the price I would give it two stars only. because it just gets dirty very quickly and similar to cheaper pairs but different color.",
            "Was really hoping for more. Fit very narrow and were extremely hard on the feet. I sent back and won't be purchasing anymore of this brand online.",
            "The shoe looms very clean and fresh. Different design. It fits very well. I am flat footed, and usually it takes a long time to fit into shoes, but these shoes were very comfortable for my flat feet. Also, the arch support on them is amazing. The stitching was poor, and when I received the shoe they had a stain on the toe box. Those are the only cons that I have with the seller. But the shoe is amazing. And the price is also great.",
            "I wear orthodics, so my arch support will be good, regardless of the shoes I wear. Overall, it fits as expected.",
            "Awesome pair of kicks...just love the style, colors and comfort Saucony offers in their footwear...i always try to keep a pair around !!!",
            "Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and he's obsessed with them. They fit perfectly and are super comfortable.",
            "These were shipped new with seems coming out already. Fabric started to rip by itself within a week of wearing them. I never buy this brand of sneaker and probably won't buy them again. Good luck with them if you buy.",

            "Overall the shoe looks great. Fits snugs but it will stretch with wear. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the midsole creasing it's like someone tried them on. It's not major crease but you can tell someone tried them on. And I put some black 3m laces in them to give them a little more flair.",

            "This review is for size/fit only. It\u2019s still summer here, but I knew I needed a new pair of snow boots and didn\u2019t want to wait until the last minute. Anyway, I am an adult, but can wear kids size 4 shoes. I ordered these in a kids 5, figuring I would probably want to wear heavy socks with them. Glad I ordered a size up because they seem to run a bit small. I agree with other reviewers that the fit is a little tight around the ankle area. But overall, they seem like they are comfortable and well made",
            "Kamik makes great quality winter boots. I have purchased this brand for years for my children and they never disappoint. So durable that they remain in good quality has hand-me-downs, too!",
            "I ordered these in black for my son. There was nothing on the boots or packaging that indicated it was for girls; it said 'youth size 5.' Like all Kamik boots we have had, these are high quality and durable. My son's feet were warm when his siblings were complaining of cold toes. I believe the temp rating label on the boot said -45 degrees F.",
            "These have always been a good boot for my growing children. Keeps them dry and warm. Removable/replaceable liner is a good bonus. The more agessive soles are great for playing outside on playground, in backyard or in icy parking lots. Easy for kids of all ages to slip into and out of compared to other good name brands that are slim fit (in calf and foot). Other good name brands are also heavier which makes kids tend to complain more as they get tired. Recommend getting size up, that way can wear thick socks or extend the use of the boot into the next season perhaps.",
            "These boots are awesome in that they're warm and dry. They're going to work perfectly for our son for those purposes. The one star dock is simply because they're very narrow in my opinion. I'd say my son has average width feet, and with a thin pair of socks they're very tight on the sides. However the length is about perfect, as expected. We'll keep them and hope they stretch out a little, or he doesn't need to wear very heavy socks ;) Overall the boot quality though is spot on.",
            "Bought these for my Son last year and they are totally waterproof, comfortable and fit him beautifully with room to grow. My Son has a wide foot and these were super comfortable and easy to slip on and off and kept him very warm during the NJ Winters and the snow. He will probably be able to use these next Winter without any problems.",
            "These are good boots- the one drawback is they get a bit narrow around the area where the strap is to tighten them, so even when the strap is I tightened you really have to stick your fingers way down to get them wide enough for a kid\u2019s foot. They did get easier to put on over time, or maybe we just figured out the system. Other than that, great boots. They kept the water out- no one complained about cold toes.",
            "Sturdy enough to withstand snow and low temperatures. Waterproof. Kept their feet dry and warm. The kids complained about it being too tight, although I had already gone a size up (as recommended in other reviews). I think it has something to do with the thick lining (see in the pictures) which is precisely what keeps their feet warm). As someone mentioned here, you can take it out, but with it would go all the insulation as well.",
            "My 9 yo son wore out his last Kamik snowboots in Size 5 after wearing them all winter for 5 months (we live in a Colorado ski town). So I ordered these is Size 6 thinking he could wear them another 6 months, but this style or new footbed was too narrow even though it was a full size larger. Sad, because we liked the color. The description on Amazon just says Kids boots, not Girls Boots, but I'm wondering if that was the width difference?? Anyway, sent these back and ordered Tundra snow boots in Size 6 instead and they fit perfectly.",
            "We\u2019ve been having a difficult time finding boots for my 10-year-old son. These boots measure the same when held up to his tennis shoes, but the fabric insert is way, way smaller and he could barely even get his foot in. It\u2019s almost like the fabric insert was at least a half size smaller than the actual boot itself. if you could fit your foot inside the fabric insert, there would be a lot of empty space between the end of it and the boot. These seem to have been designed poorly. We had to return them.",
            "This is the 4th year I have purchased Kamik boots for my son. They fit to size and keep his feet warm. This style it different from the previous style I purchased when he wore a 10 or smaller as he was able to open the other ones up easily to get his feet in. So far so good with this style now that he is 5 years old. I ordered an 11.",
            "Best kids boots! I bought the black for my son and he has worn them all winter (and it\u2019s still snowing). He gets stinky feet so I just remove the liners, wash in the washer, air dry and he\u2019s good to go. Only complaint he has is the bottom of his foot gets the little pilly balls and he likes to rip them out. I fear eventually he\u2019ll rip the liner! 10 year old boy size 4.",
            "I don't know why the item description says \"girls\" in the shopping cart. These are definitely unisex boots. I bought them for my 10 yo son. He wears a size 6 shoe, and the size 6 boots fit great with room to grow. Kamik boots are great quality. I've been buying them for years. I have one pair that all 3 of my boys have worn, and they are still in great shape!",
            "I ordered these for my son not realizing they were girls snowboots..but since they were black it didn't matter. They fit him perfectly. He wears a size 5.5 show and I ordered the 5.5's in these and they were a great fit. They kept his feet warm and dry while on a recent trip to the mountains where they had just had a snow storm. These worked out great. I recommend them 100% to anyone. I will probably come back to these same ones here on Amazon when it's time to move him up a size.",
            "Purchased for my daughter. As far as I know they fit as expected. I ordered one size up simply to extend them into next winter as well as it's easy to double up socks if needed. She's played in the snow a few different times in these and they've kept her feet warm and dry. They are easy to put on and off and cinch easily. Would buy again!",
            "These are the fourth winter Kamik boots we bought for my son. And this is the only pair which make he has his feet wet every time after a walk.",
            "I bought these for my son and they were too small. Nicely enough, they fit me! So I kept them. My feet are always cold in the winter but these boots kept them warm and I was able to play outside with my kids for about 2 hours and stay comfortably warm. This never happens so I'm giving these boots two enthusiastic thumbs up!",
            "My grandaughter wears size 8 shoe. I ordered a 10 because of the liner. They fit her, a little extra room for another pair of socks. They might fit next year, you never know how much a child's foot is going to grow. She can walk in them fine, no tripping.",
            "Great quality at a good price. My son says they are comfortable and never complains about cold toes. They are waterproof all the way up and you can use the string on top to keep snow out. IF you do get the insides wet, the liner is removeable to dry. And with older boys, the ability to air it out is nice.",
            "I ordered a size bigger for both of my kids considering the snow socks that would go inside, they are super amazing quality and it comes w a removable insole, easy to put in and out for my 4yr, for my 2 yr still working on that... but over all super satisfied",
            "Seem to be well made and the fit is great, but they are definitely not waterproof. Our daughter manages to get her feet soaking wet playing in heavy snow and slush.",
            "I can\u2019t believe these boots! My 7-year old came home from school on the first day of wearing them during recess (in the snow) and the liners along the sole of his feet were soaked! I\u2019m so upset after spending a good chunk of money on what I thought were water proof boots.",
            "Grandkids had this brand before and it worked out well so I ordered them again, based on our prior experience. They fit well, keep their feet warm, and come up high enough to keep the rain/snow out. My grandson wore them for a season, turned them over to his sister for another season and now she\u2019s outgrown them hence we have re-ordered",
            "This is our second pair die for my son, love these boots! Warm, dry and easy to put on and take off. Love the height too when using in deep snow.",
            "Happy with purchase. Seem to be holding up to an active 7 year old in a Wisconsin winter. It's been in deep puddles with spring thaw, piles of snow and slush. The boots do not come home with wet liners thankfully, the outside surface may be wet, but doesn't seem to affect the inside. Appreciate that feature for a kids boot. Also so far happy that the liner has not worn out as they always seem to do. My child is also pleased with non-wet feet after recess. Would consider again when the feet grow.",
            "We received the boots before a ski trip and while away, I kept asking my son if he had his boots on the right feet. Come to find out while away and trying to wear them, the company made a boot with two left feet. It was somewhat difficult to tell just looking at them but come to find out, they were defective. The fabric of the boot that went up his leg was sewn on another left boot. Needless to say, they have been returned.",
            "I ordered both the size 6 and size 7 US Big Kids' boots to see which was better. I usually wear a women's 7 or 7 W, but in boys' shoes, a size 5.5. The size 6 boots are a little bit snug with bulky socks on, but the size 7 was too big, and my foot slid around. Went with the size 6, and wore them for a hike in the forest recently. I think the inner pad in the smaller size will mold nicely to my feet after a few wearings.",
            "Love this make of boot....they last and last (each pair last long enough to be pasted to all three of my children) and keep feet warm and dry through a Wisconsin winter! Could improve their look....lacking in style and good looks, but hardworking",
            "Easy for my kid to put on himself. Removable liners are a nice bonus. Good quality materials as always with Kamik. This is the 4th or 5th pair we\u2019ve bought for our son through the years and are never disappointed.",
            "These are the kid boots I keep coming back to. Waterproof, warm, traction and they\u2019ve worked in Alaska and Wyoming. Spendy for us, but they have lasted through 4 pairs of boy feet. Excellent.",
            "We love Kamik brand of snow boots. My oldest son needed new ones this year and we got these. They are well made and look nice. My youngest son is wearing the Kamik ones my oldest had when he was about 6 or 7 yrs old and they have lots of life left in them.",
            "Great kid boots for a MN winter. I have had two kids in these for two years, they never complain of cold feet. They play outside for recess almost every day here, and usually after school too. Lots of time in temps between 0 and 30F.",
            "Can not say enough about these boots and this brand. Great fit and my daughter did not even complain once when we were in New Hampshire in - 10-degree weather. She loves these so much she wears them anytime there is a hint of snow.",
            "Was so happy to have it in the closet when the first snowfall hit early in November. Kids spent the whole day outside wearing their boots and playing.",
            "I bought these for my 2nd grade grand-daughter and a pair of pink ones for my 1st grade grand-daughter. They are easy off and on and the toggle closure at the top cinches them in simply and without the need for tying any laces. These are excellent quality boots, very warm, and will keep their feet cozy and dry!",
            "These are great toddler snow boots. Fit true to see, easy on and off and a handy pull tab at the top to tighten the boot around the leg to decrease the amount of whining you might here if snow or ice were to accidentally find it's way down the boot!",
            "Our daughter said that the boots squeezed her feet. The liner made her feel uncomfortable",
            "This is the 4th type of winter boot I have tried for my kids, and so far these have been the best. They were recommended to me by a friend and she said this is the only kind she buys for her kids, so I thought I would give it a try. My kids seem to really like them. Comfortable and warm. Going forward this is the brand I intend to order again.",
            "I ordered one size up (10) for my 4yo and they were too small, I think it was mostly the width. In desperation of up coming snow I bought her a pair of second hand sorel boots (9) and they fit perfect. But they seemed like really nice boots otherwise",
            "I liked the boot very much , except it says Girl boot, and really should be advertised as Unisex, as my 10 year old grandson is the one that they were purchased for, nothing that suggest it is a \"GIRL\" THING.",
            "These boots were absolutely too small! Not just a little but 2 sizes smaller!",
            "Kid's feet are always warm and dry. Liners are removable but never had to take them out. We ALWAYS buy Kamik boots for our Minnesota winters.",

            "I love these boots My daughter loves them too \ud83d\ude0a These boots are super warm and have a removable insulated inside so u can wash them or dry when they get wet inside (my favorite part). The colors are pretty and I totally would buy them again. These are a great buy.",
            "Kamik boots are the best kids boot for a reasonable price. East to take off and on. They stand up to Buffalo winters.",

            "I bought 4 pairs, 1 for each of my grandkids we had our first snow fall the past 3 days and let me tell you their feet stay toasty warm and dry in these boots.....if you child has a wide foot order a size or 2 larger and thick winter socks so they fit all winter long and into soggy muddy spring thaw!",
            "Kamik seems to run a little big but don\u2019t get a smaller size then planned. Wool socks offset that difference. So far good, easy for the kids to put on themselves.",

            "Boots fit great, and are very comfortable . This is my second time purchasing Lucky brand boots and I love them .",
            "These boots are great. Stylish and comfortable. I can wear them all day despite the joint problems. Feet do not get hot - perfect summer boots. I wear 7.5 and I got 7.5 and the size is just right. On the side note: leather stains. Someone dropped a piece of apricot on the shoe so I had to wipe it with water right away. The area I washed looks darker when it dried. There is no dirty spot from fruit juice. The color is just darker now. So I wiped both boots with water entirely and now they are same darker color. BTW, I like the new color :) So maybe spray them with suede protector before going out.",
            "This is my go to boot that seems to go with anything (bought the dark stone color). It looks like a mix between taupe and gray. It fits just perfect! I wear a size 8 normally and that's what I ordered. I can even wear a thin sock with them. The holes do make them a little \"cool\" in the winter and probably not water repellent by any means. But I live in SC so that's not a concern. Would definitely order again. This is my second pair of Lucky boots and I love them both.",
            "I ordered these in the dark stone color and they just arrived yesterday. Love them!!! Right out of the box they are soft and supple, and despite some of the reviews stating that they run narrow, I didn't find that to be the case. I ordered in my usual size (8) and in medium width they are perfect for my 'sometimes needs a wide width' foot. There does, however, seem to be an extra bit of room at the toe, so perhaps I could have gone with a 7 1/2 instead. Either way, I'm very happy with them.",
            "I thought these looked nice in the photos, but they're even better in person! The leather is so soft, and I've been able to wear them without socks with no risk of blisters. Love the zippers on each side, and the perforation will make these a great option for warmer days. Also, the heel isn't too tall, so they're comfortable to wear as a more casual boot than some of my others. I got the dark stone color, but am tempted to buy the black ones, too.",
            "These are great spring fall boots. The fit is a little odd for me-I have a somewhat narrow or maybe thin foot. There is room for a very thick sock which I will never wear. I usually take a 7, Length is good just maybe because the material is soft and flexible it feels a bit bulky? Hard to explain I am keeping them but don\u2019t plan to walk miles in them.",
            "Extremely comfortable and so cute! I bought these in bisque and love them! I usually wear size 6.5 or 7. I ordered these in a 7, and they fit well. They have a tiny bit of room, but are perfect with socks, so I would say true to size!",
            "I have never worn this brand and was not sure what size to order; I wear an 8 or 8.5 depending on the brand. I ordered the 8.5 but need this in an 8 so I have to send this one back. Hope they have an 8 in this as it's a very cute shoe. Looks great with jeans and capris. I love the color, it can be worn with just about anything. I was pleased that this shoe felt pretty comfortable. The arch support seemed a little lacking but I think it's because the shoe is too big on me. The foot bed is lightly cushioned and feels nice, at least it does walking around the house.",
            "I love this bootie! I have 2 other pairs that I've worn almost daily for the last 7 months. My feet feel so comfortable in them. It's also good for my feet, back, and posture not to be wearing an elevated heel. Highly recommend!",
            "the perfect color and style. However, the comfort level is not the highest. They are very flat and hard at the bottom and my bunions do not love using them all day. I think the leather will stretch and soon I will be better in width. They are super cute. But I know I do not want to walk all day in them!",
            "I got size 6 color Bisque due to the lowest price comparing with other color. It is a comfortable boot; and it is also good for warm weather because of leather upper features large perforated detail throughout. The air can get into the boot in warm weather. The Heel Height: 1 1\u20442 inches is right height for me. I am glad to find this kind of boot I was looking for.",
            "I purchased this boot as an on-trend alternative to my work shoes. I ordered an 8.5 wide because I knew I could add insoles if they were a bit loose, and I plan to wear thin black socks with them. I'm very pleased. I chose the dark stone - similar to a nice gray. They are going to look nice with dress work pants or with jeans. I think they're appropriate year-round. You do slightly see your sock fabric beneath the holes, so dark socks or black hose will look fine.",
            "These booties are so cute. You can wear them with jeans in the fall. Because they have little holes they work great with jean shorts in the summer! They are comfortable and I get a lot of complements on them! For more style inspiration and affordable fashion connect with me on IG @love.ericamarie or fb under Erica's Deals, Steals, and Finds! XOXO, Erica Marie",
            "This is my 3rd pair of Lucky Basel Ankle Boots. I absolutely love them! They are super comfortable, I wrote them all day today, brand new out of the box, and had no problem whatsoever! I'm am art teacher and I spend the majority of the day on my feet. I highly recommend these boots and plan to get more in other colors.",
            "I have problem feet and chose these because I thought that because of the perforations they might not irritate my foot, especially where the bunion is. I was right. they're great and stretch out well, which is what I'd hoped. Nice looking too.",
            "These shoes are perfectly what I expected from photos and Brand Name. They are comfortable and sturdy - the heels are perfect. They don't have the cushion that walking boots have but are comfortable.",
            "Having the perforations allows more stretch with the leather, so if you have width or toe box issues, this boot is very comfortable. The style and quality are great too.",
            "I like these booties very much ;I I wish they were peep toe but that's alright still nice boots ,I usually take an 8half ;but they were to long on the length; so I ordered a size 8 and they fit better ;I like the natural colour goes with everything ,I am sure if you get these you will love them to . and the price is good .",
            "Got these for my mom after she commented on mine. She's 86 and love them. Super comfy and stylish and the ankle opening is narrow. They look so good with jeans or dresses or skirts!",
            "Really cute, beautiful color. Look nice with jeans, leggings or a skirt. Very happy with this purchase. I usually wear size 8.5 in closed toe boots, but I ordered size 8 and they fit great",
            "Lucky brand always runs on the small side for me, so I know I need a size 9 when I normally wear size 8-8.5. So they fit and look great!!! So happy to have them for summer.",
            "It was a nice looking shoe, a great design,with great vent holes to keep your feet cool. Unfortunately to was too small plus the high front bothered the top of my foot, the front portion should be cut lower. I order the size larger but it to was not comfortable for my foot since I have a high in-step.",
            "I usually wear a 7 or 7 1/2 but these were too small. I haven't returned them but may just resell since shipping back is a hassle. The quality is amazing and they are super cute, just go a size up!",
            "Received boots today, they came sooner than expected.. They looked exceptional exactalty what I was looking for, the fit were perfect. I was concern the color would be a bit off or they would be small! But they are just perfect very happy with my purchase.",
            "Cute shoes but I'm returning because the shaft hit against the bottom of my legs and that was pretty annoying. I had indents in my skin after wearing them around the house for an hour.",
            "I get so many compliments when I wear these-even from men!!. Incredibly comfortable because of the perforated suede making them nice and cool on the warmer days when sweat would pool in other leather booties. This is my \"Back Up Pair\" because I know they will all be gone soon. The absolute best buy of the Spring!!",
            "This is a fun boot and will do well on an average foot. I exchanged once for a half size up from my usual size, but had to return because the bigger one was a bit sloppy on my narrow foot.",
            "I only buy Lucky boots as they fit me the best. I have these in taupe and was waiting for the gray in my size. These are great, very comfortable and I get compliments all the time!!",
            "These boots are comfy and stylish! I got several compliments the first day I wore them and one girl who noticed them knew the exact brand! I felt like a rock star in them and can't wait to wear them in New Orleans!",
            "Love the color. Very comfortable and I wear a sock with them. Did not see sock through the holes either. So happy with them. I wear 8 to 81/2 in most shoes. The 8 fits great with a sock. Probably a bit to big w/o sock.",
            "Second pair and I love these! No socks ! They are so comfortable and I can walk a country mile in these boots.",
            "I had to send back unfortunately they were too large at the end of the toes. Cute color and well made. I wish they would have been more rounded at the bottom. I purchased a pair of lucky boots and they worked out great and love them.!!!!!!",
            "Nice bootie! Great color. Looks gray sometimes and tan others, depending on what is worn.",
            "Not as cute in person. I personally didn't like the way they looked on my feet. They fit, but it felt like the open-hole leather would give too much and ultimately make them feel too big. Had to return.",
            "Love. I have a high arch and there is adequate room through that area. Toe box could be a little more roomy but not bad. The design with the holes help keep my feet cool so I\u2019m excited to be able to wear in the summer months. Color is a little more stone than grey, or maybe like a warm grey, not a cool or blue undertone.",
            "Many, many compliments. Shoes are great, good looking and comfortable right out of the box, even with my high arches. Also cool from perforations, nice change from sandals. Even non-shoe type persons and strangers have complimented.",
            "They feel like slippers. The leather is a good quality, the zippers are excellent not that flimsy kind that you know in a few tugs it will break. I will be putting my own insole, I want to enjoy them all winter. I'm in Florida so these will be perfect.",
            "These are more comfortable than you would think! They are see through, so be mindful of that.",
            "Okay, Lucky runs narrow and small in my experience so I learned from past experiences to buy in a half size up and then they are perfect fit. These are really pretty and unusual, I always get compliments when I wear any of my lucky brand shoes. These are an unusual fleshy/peach/nude color.",
            "I adore these boots! They are perfect for spring/summer! I usually wear a size 8 and I ordered an 8 1/2 because I do have bunions from wearing high heels for years! I'm going to keep the 8 1/2 but I think a size 8 would have been totally fine. I have a large family and own a restaurant and I am on my feet constantly and they are so comfortable!",
            "LOve these! Due to the little holes you can even wear them in the summer time \ud83d\ude2c The style is classic. I have that sane shoe in multitude of different different colors lol. Very comfortable",
            "The most comfortable shoes I bought without fitting! They are awesome!",
            "This boot fits True to size and very nice looking. Do know that the small holes that make up the design are open, so they wouldn't be the best to wear in wet weather.",
            "I love these booties!! I plan to buy the gray ones very soon. They're cute and comfortable and go with so many things!! I love them. Found them true to size, but not much arch support. However, I haven't found that to be a problem.",
            "These are super comfy like all of the other reviews mention! I love the style and the color is great. I ordered an 8 1\u20442 (usually I wear an 8 or 8 1\u20442) and they fit perfect. I wear short no-show black socks with them and they look fine, although with the holes in the shoes you can see them a little bit. I'm excited to wear them more as it gets cooler!",
            "Love these so much I have them in multiple colors! Extremely comfortable all day...true to size.. Best little booties \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e",
            "I went a size up cause I have a wide foot. Love the boot. The color is great goes with anything. Going to order another color. Very comfortable, you can wear a thin sock under it .",
            "Love these boots! Just wore them for the first time today. Their are attractive, stylish and very comfortable. They look better in person. I did order a half size larger. I wear size 9 shoes so i ordered size 9.5 U.S. Hopefully they hold up over time.",
            "Love the style and fit. Wore for a funeral service.",
            "These are cute. I am a 7.5 but sized down to 7.0 and they are still too large. I am going to keep them and put a heel cushion in.",
            "This is my second pair of Basel booties. The fit just as expected & looks great. Before I wear them outside I'm going to apply a silicon spray to protect the nubuck leather.",
            "Product was exactly like the picture and fit as expected. Great summer shoe.",
            "I was so apprehensive about buying shoes on-line! But these fit perfect and are so comfy. I know I'll be getting a lot of wear out of them. Great purchase!",
            "Do Not buy these boots. They are the right size but they are so hard and ungiving on the heel. I have tried to wear them twice and get severe blisters. I have tried bandaids, socks, cushioning. It is too bad as I love them but am not able to wear them. Even with all the cushioning.",
            "I love these!!! They're very comfortable and go with so many outfits. Very happy with them.",
            "Love the low boots! They fit fine, but I wish there was more of an arch support: I bought arch supports for them so hope that solves the problem.",
            "Love these! My second pair! I usually am a 7.5-8. Def get a 8!",
            "Leather is not thick .... but is a really nice ankle boot... my wife loves it",
            "Absolutely love these boots. They are very comfortable and I get many compliments.",
            "I\u2019ve been searching for a comfortable and well fitting shoe for a while and finally tried lucky brand and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. The sole is soft and there\u2019s good arch support.",
            "I like the color. The boots are true to size. I will enjoy this pair of boots for all seasons. This pair of boots are versatile I would recommend these boots to anyone.",
            "Such as nice ankle boot , my wife loves it . Good quality , true leather .",
            "Love the gray-green color of these boots! This style is very easy to wear from the beginning of putting them on. The perforations allow the foot to breathe in the boot.",
            "Love these boots! They are really comfortable, and I seldom find any boots or shoes particularly comfortable. I've never worn Lucky brand before, but I will definitely buy them again.",
            "These are the 5th pair of Lucky brand bootie that I own .. I have them in different colors .. They are stylish and can be worn with many different things.. No breaking in on these booties so comfortable right out of the box.. I LOVE them!!",
            "Great looking boots, but much too small. Returned and found a larger size.",
            "As a teacher, I'm on my feet most of the day. Overall, they're comfortable, but I think they were somewhat snug in the toes and I have a narrow foot. Maybe order a 1/2 size bigger?",
            "Very comfortable ankle boots. I have in multiple colors because I wear them so often.",
            "These boots are so cool, I love the color and the shoe molds to your foot with still giving you all day support. I've worn them twice and gotten compliments both times!",
            "The most comfortable boots and very fancy... My man fell on them",
            "I love these boots! They are super comfy for wearing all day. I was concerned that the heels might slip (I\u2019ve sprained an ankle wearing boots that have slipped on tile) but they don\u2019t. The rubber on the heel is softer than some heels.",
            "These shoes are a nearly daily wear for me. The leather fits my foot perfectly for walking the 30 minutes each day to work and an active day at work. LOVE",

            "These boots are just as expected, but I do think I'll love them more after I break them in. Currently they are pretty tight, but once they get stretched out I think they will be perfect. Great quality and look. Don't plan on wearing socks with them as you can see through them and like I said they are pretty tight. All that being said I even have a narrow, long foot.

I had bought a pair from a store on line and when I got the I couldn't believe how comfortable they were but I quickly returned them when I found them on Amazon for 30.00 cheaper! Well when I got them they seemed a little small but I thought they would just break in and be fine, so I wore them \ud83d\ude14 and after a couple hours my feet hurt \ud83d\ude29 so unfortunately since I wore them I think I am stuck with them\ud83d\ude21 I just think in a shoe this expensive the sizing should be consistent!",

The boot is very comfortable, but has little arch support. I am flat footed, so it didn't matter. During my daily commute, I would just switch to sneakers.",

These boots are going to look adorable with many different type of outfits..skinny jeans, skirts, dresses etc. Highly recommend this product and vendor.",

The boots boast a soft and flexible material, feeling extremely comfortable despite initial tightness, and are expected to fit well after breaking in.

            "Perfection!! Great price for an outstanding product. I wear a ladies 6.5 to 7 and ordered the big kids size 5 and the fit is SPOT ON!! Been wearing Uggs for 9 years and never have I actually paid the higher price for the actual ladies version. Unexpected bonus to these moccasins is that the leather laced tie is actually sewn in. If you've ever owned any other type of moc once they come untied they never look the same. Not to mention the leather laces eventually end up snapping from the constant tug of redoing the tie. Not ever going to be the case here!!! LOVE THEM!!",
            "I loved these slippers i had them for about 4 Los Angeles winters. They just recently gave up on me so I have moved on to another style but these are great. The grippers on the soles are perfect for all surfaces and I can be anywhere in the house with them even in the garage laundry room changing a load. the color is great and they honestly didnt stain until this last year. I have been very happy with this slipper. The new ones I bought are these with a tiny ball of fur in the middle close to the ankle.",
            "I have been buying slippers upon slippers without finding the right one. I spent so much money over the years that I could kick myself. Why I waited so long , to try UGG, is beyond me! I have small feet so I was so glad to see that the kids size could fit my feet. I absolutely love my new slippers and I will never buy another brand ever again. They are so cozy, comfy and fit perfectly. Thank you UGG for producing such a wonder product.",
            "I got these originally in a size 4 for my daughter who wears a 2.5 or 3 in Converse and other shoes. The 4s were way too small (maybe because of the furry lining?) but the 5s are great. The shoes are adorable and super comfy so I would recommend them to anyone- just take the furry lining into account when choosing a size.",
            "This is a comfortable and cozy slipper. Yes, arriving at the correct size could be a challenge, but when you find your size and wear the slipper for a few days, it conforms to your foot and feels wonderful. I have a narrow foot, so size can be a problem. This particular style seems to be more conforming and forgiving than some of their other styles. It comes up higher on the top of the foot, so it tends to slip on the heal less. I doubt this would be a problem for those who have a wider foot.",
            "Pretty sure these are fake. UGG website said every pair of genuine UGGS has a QR code that can be scanned to determine legitimacy. Where the tag should be is a similar looking tag but no QR code. Also, the UGG logo on slippers does not have the trademark symbol. Shoulda used Zappos!",
            "I bought these ugg slippers based on the review of others. It's exactly what they said. They are kid size 6, but fits as if it was an adult shoe size 8. At first they feel snug but, in a few days it starts to stretch and feels fine. I paid less than the women size. They are so comfortable. I wear them to work or when I pick up the kids from school and go for short errands.",
            "Pretty good. They were perfect out of the box but have stretched a bit since so now they slide some in the heel fit. They are super warm and fuzzy. Worth your time! I am a size 7-7.5 womens and I got the size 5.",
            "I'm super bummed that the stitch on these popped at the seam about a month after I had them. I had to take them to a show repair place and get them fixed. The string that holds the bow in place also fell off the first week, making it a pain to have to keep tying the bow. Otherwise, they are you basic ugg, insanely comfortable and very warm. I was just not happy about the quality - hopefully I just got a bad pair.",
            "My granddaughter loves them. It's too bad they don't have half sizes. She usually wares a 4 but I guess because of the lining they were too tight so we got the size 5 and they were a little too big but she manages to keep them on her feet.",
            "Super comfortable, looks great! Fit a little tight as expected, but after about a month they now are the perfect fit and wear them everyday as a house slipper, exactly what I was looking for",

I love it that they have a sole and you can wear them out of the house if you so desire. My mom and I both wear a women's size 7. The children's size 5 fits perfectly and is less expensive than buying the adult size. I have three pairs of UGG boots and love them. I don't normally spend so much on shoes, but they are worth every penny. Buy the slippers!!",

It is rare to find a deal on this name brand, but...I purchased these for my daughter and found that this particular color choice (chestnut) in children sizes was hard to find locally.

            "Got these for my daughter, who wears a Women's 6.5. The 5 fits great and I know they'll last and keep her feet warm.",
            "What I do like is the softness.. What don\u2019t like is it looks totally different then the picture",
            "Purchased for my daughter and she loves them, good fit!",
            "Go up a size since they run small in kids sizes.",
            "Wear these all the time. I wear a women\u2019s 6.5 and purchased a children\u2019s 5 and they fit perfectly! Very comfortable and worth the money!",
            "I got tired of using boots in the cold so I though this slippers will help and it actually did. It's very warm and confe, you can also walk comfortable. I totally recommend it!",
            "If you wear UGGs, you know they are not true to size and you have to find your perfect size. But I LOVE these slippers!!!!! I'm usually a size 6/7 in women's but a size 4-5 in UGGs",
            "Normally wear size 5 women's and these fit perfectly. High quality and comfortable. Minnetonka's do not even compare. I love these!",

            "The color of these aren't like the ones I ordered from the original ugg site. I ordered 3 more from the ugg site because they were on sale. The color of these are so off.. So I'm confused whether these are real or not? I think they are but just the color make me feel like they aren't.",
            "I wear a woman's 7.5 shoe and bought these in kids size 38. Equal sizes in European size. They are cozy and warm. I can wear them out, they are fashionable suitable for a run to the store or to the kids sports events.",
            "Typical ugg quality so very soft and warm with a durable bottom. Unfortunately they were to big so they are going back.",
            "Came on time in adequate packaging. My only issue is that the material seems worn out on the sides, as if has been sun damaged or out in the sun for too long. It may be something that can be treated to restore the material but they're new, I shouldn't have to do that. Luckily I will use them indoors so their appearance doesn't matter.",
            "A little tight. Too much to break in. Overall very nice though. Ordered one size up.",
            "100% authentic loved the color and the size fit really good",

            "They rock.......to quote my granddaughter. They were a Christmas gift to her from us",
            "I really did not know what to expect from these shoes. I typically wear a size 6.5 in woman's but I saw these for a lot less in a kids size 5. I'm so glad I did. They fit perfectly and they are so comfortable.",
            "The shoes are very nice but they are cut small. I wear a 5.5 in kids but uggs usually run big becayse the uggs I have are a sz 5. For these I would need a 6.",
            "Life Hack - girls size 6 uggs are equivalent to a womens size 8 - and are cheaper - I love my uggs. So comfy cozy and the sheepskin never matts down. Great product :) They will stretch out over time.",
            "Unfortunately so did our dog so we have to buy a second pair, which I will gladly so because they are super warm and cozy.",
            "For some reason not true Ugg fit was to small",
            "These are so warm and comfy. I wear a size 5 in ladies and the children size 4 fits perfectly. Love them!!",
            "I love how comfortable they are. The slippers seem a little large,but the quality and style are wonderful. I recommend ordering a half size smaller than you normally wear.",
            "They came beautifully wrapped and my grandson loved them.Uggs makes a very nice slipper and in this case, they were a good buy at Amazon.com. Thank you!",
            "I usually wear a 6 1/2, so I ordered a 6 medium, they feel a little big, hopefully they won't stretch much.",

            "These are so comfortable! Absolutely love them! I wear a size 7 in women's and ordered a size 5 in childrens and they fit great!",
            "I just got these and at first they fit so good and after the first day they started to lose their shape. Also the fur inside feels so weird compared to other ugg moccassins ive purchased before.",
            "Fast and courteous service..moccassins were in perfect shape and just as they had said. Would definetly purchase from them in the future.",
            "Don't believe you can order a 6 and wear it as an adult women's 8 as some reviewers advise. It's not true. I've tried to make it work for weeks and they just don't stretch. Be aware that it's not a 'real' UGG product so you are paying a lot for a faux sheepskin moccasin. It's made in China, not Australia. UGG in Australia doesn't make a moccasin, and all of it's products are made in Melbourne."

Below are my ratings: Weight: 1.ASICS TR2, 2.Puma Pulse XT, 3.Reebok Nano 5 Comfort: 1.Puma Pulse XT/ 1.Reebok Nano 5/ 1.ASICS TR2 [Every one of them are comfortable] Foot room: 1.Reebok Nano 5, 2.Puma Pulse XT, 3.ASICS TR2 Lifting: 1.Reebok Nano 5, 2.Puma Pulse XT/ 2.ASICS TR2 Metcon: [Any lifting, Box jumps, Rope climbs] 1.Reebok Nano 5, 2.Puma Pulse XT/ 2.ASICS TR2 Double unders: 1.Puma Pulse XT/ 1.ASICS TR2, 2.Reebok Nano 5",
            "Shoes were a bit of an odd size. If I went for 12.5 I think it would be to big. 12 was a little snug. I got a blister on a middle toe. Shin splints by day 2. I have been doing 3.5 miles a day in skate shoes with less leg and ankle pain. I give it 2 star because they are light, fair price, quick delivery, but the shoes are not the best shoes if had for the money.",
            "Found these at such a great price I bought the pair even though I have three older pairs, one in same color and two in gray/black. Neat design, very different than any other athletic shoes I own and they are hard to wear out. They are a narrow fit which is fine for my foot but if you need a wide foot bed they may not work for you. ASICS is my go to athletic shoe but their cross trainers are hard to find and it is a shame because they are such a great shoe!",
            "I'll try and make this concise: 1. My foot is not narrow; 2. My foot is not wide. This shoe fits my foot very well. I can see it being a little snug as the toe box approaches but I liked my 1st pair so much I turned around and bought another pair. I use these for HIIT, weight and functional training (push ups, pull ups etc...), and I absolutely love them. I was looking for a shoe that was close to a zero drop/minimalist shoe to enhance biomechanics in my feet and lower legs and this shoe is giving me everything I'm looking for!!! Hope this helps",
            "Returning these as they were too oddly shaped to be worn comfortably. I normally wear 10.5, so thats what I ordered. The length was fine, actually probably a little roomy, but the toe box was so tight I couldn't imagine working out and not having bad blisters on my toes. The front of the shoes are really narrow. Also, they look worse in person than they do in pictures. They are some uggo shoes.",
            "These shoes are new so my impressions are not extensive. The shoe fits snug as commented on by other reviewers. However, for me I wouldn't go a size bigger because I expect them to loosen with wear and I want a snug fit for gym work. They look kind of odd because they are not symmetrical and remind me of soccer shoes with the laces off center for better ball contact. We'll see if that makes a difference with time. Typically, for me, the Asics last fits my foot well and I think I'll like these. I'll try to remember to comment in a couple months after they've had some wear.",
            "I really did like these shows and wanted them to work, but they're very narrow. I got the size perfect in terms of length, but they were very tight on my through the middle of my foot, and I don't usually need the wide-size in footwear. They were very minimalist and light, and would have been great for speed and agility work. If you have narrow feet, and find regular shoes a little too roomy, however, these would be perfect for you.",
            "I have owned these for a bit over one month. Given I workout 6-days per week, I have had more than sufficient time form an opinion. These have withstood my workouts very well. I have high arches and these provide all the support I need for hard sprints and jumping. Traction has been better than I expected -- even on the cinder track where I do my sprint work and, as you might expect, extremely secure on the soft gym surfaces. I would definitely purchase these again, as long as Asics does not change them for the worse.",
            "When ordering I was somewhat not sure of this color but good thing I ordered this one instead Black. I it feels a little tight at first since I have wide feet but after using ( Freeletics ) it molded my feet and gives support with my training.",
            "These shoes are great for weight training, I am more partial to the original Fortius because the upper isn't as stiff as it is in this one but once they are broken in the fit feels better. There is still an ample amount of stability, which is ideal for squatting and the toe box is fairly similar. The size is true to fit as well, I would recommend these as a cross trainer over any other shoe.",
            "These looked like the perfect shoes for my P90X workouts. Unfortunately, they run small and I had to return them. They did not have the next size up available.",
            "Great shoe construction and look, but WAY too narrow for my foot (and I don't have fat feet :) . I instead opted for the ASICS Met Conviction ( It was equally as well made and had a better fit across my foot.",
            "These shoes would be awesome if the website had provided me the correct shoe size. Please make sure to get 1/2 to 1 full size larger then the website says. I usually wear a size 10.5-11 shoe and the site says pick 10. My toes were all cramped into the end of them and the width was way too narrow.",
            "I am a huge Asics fan, and have been for years but I can't wear my running shoes to Crossfit. When I saw these shoes come out, I jumped on board, but when I put them on my feet I was sadly disappointed. They are extremely narrow and pinch my feet, in fact the shoes look like hot dog buns. I returned immediately and am going back to my Nike Free's.",
            "For the price these are great. I bought them for $60 I think and I won't buy a different pair. I have always been an asic supporter and I will continue to do so. I bought these for crossfit workouts and so far they have held up and are much more comfortable and better looking than the previous version. I can't bring myself to buy the Reebok Crossfit shoes for $100+ when I can buy these for way less. 5 stars if they can come up with some better colors.",
            "These are my third pair of Asics but the first ones that don't fit correctly. Normally I wear a 10.5, and the description says to order a half size bigger, but these size 11s are way too narrow. I'm sure they'll break in nicely, but I'm pretty sure my foot is wider than the sole of this shoe.",
            "They fit small like everyone said, but since I read that about them and ordered a half size larger than normal, I'm doing fine. They still felt narrow out of the box, but now that I've worn them a while, I have no complaints. I don't fall over trying to deadlift like I did in my running shoes.",
            "I purchased them because I had sent back some Reebok cross fit lifter 2.0. I bought them because my Under Armour sneakers just wasn't good for cross fit or lifting. I had some reserves because of the cost being less expensive. I couldn't be more impressed with these shoes, they were so comfortable being a minimalist shoe and also how they were able to withstand the cleans, jerks and everything else I did...Kudos to Asics for such a great shoe.",
            "I bought these for better balance for squatting and dead lifts. They work great for weight training. They fit a little small so keep that in mind when ordering. I have a pair of size 13 Asics running shoes and they have a good extra thumb length in the toe, these in a size 13 do not.",
            "Great work out shoe. Bad for running tho. Gives me shin splits. Comfortable other then that. Overall love them.",
            "nice style n print, however as mentioned its a trainning shoe, not too ideal for running as it lacks that flexibility, but gives great support and glad that its more on minimalist style.",
            "Very basic/decent shoes, not the best fit for crossfit. There is no amortization whatsoever, they hit very hard on your knees, terrible to run with them. Very good for weight lifting.",
            "I wanted to like these shoes, but they are too small and narrow. I bought these shoes in half a size larger than my normal shoe size as other reviewers suggested, but these shoes were still too small and narrow. My toes were sticking out of the side, and the shoe mashed my toes together. I like ASICS as a brand, but their minimalist shoes need work. If you're looking for a minimalist shoe, I recommend checking out Vivobarefoot. Their whole philosophy is barefoot shoes.",
            "So everyone has their favorite shoe for functional fitness. I love these. They are my first pair and i use them for SOFLETe. Doing the Olympic lifts and all the workouts in then feel amazing. I love them. Id never lift in running shoes again. Theyre durable and comfortable and super light. They do well also for rope climbs and box jumpa",
            "These shoes are great! My husband bought them for interval training and loved them. They are not overpriced and are much cheaper than comparable shoes. He has narrower feet and likes his workout shoes to be snug. He ordered his true size and is happy with them",
            "I would love to give this a higher rating. But I have not had the chance to workout in them the shoe was to narrow so had to return them . Seems to be I very well built shoe also a very narrow shoe so getting this shoe in wide would be advisable.",
            "They do not run true to size, that said I read the reviews and ordered a 1/2 size bigger than needed and they fit ok. They are a bit snug but I wouldn't say terribly narrow. 14 year old son seem to like them but I know that his feet will be sore after running in them for track and jumping has they don't have any arch support.",
            "These are narrow; I'm a woman wearing a 6.5 and it fits great.",
            "Best training shoe I've ever had. They last forever. I've purchased three paid so far because they are so inexpensive even though I haven't even worn down the first pair.",
            "I have very flat feet which was causing me knee pains when I lifted. Every since I got these the pain has gone away and I'm able to lift even more.",
            "These shoes have been a nice surprise. They are extemely comfortable and allow me to remain fairly flat footed (a great thing!) for heavy weight lifting. I wouldn't go running in these shoes but they are perfect for lifting weights.",
            "If it fit me, and was not so narrow.. They would be a excellent pair of weight lifting shoes but too bad",
            "Love them. I also have the previous version of these and still wear them all the time. Great for daily, casual wear and weight training.",
            "Super awesome shoes, they fit so nice and really do the job for my cros fit. I do really recommend these shoes, are so awesome!!",
            "Great minimalist shoe, I have narrow feet so the fit is good. I ordered a 1/2 size larger based on previous reviews. This shoe has very little arch support however it works very well in the gym, and on the soccer field. Decent build quality, I've been wearing them for about 3 months and am very happy with the purchase.",
            "Love these shoes. I wear them to Title Boxing four days a week and Boot camp one to two days a week. Lo Iike all ASICS shoes I have owned they fit snug. I normally wear a 9.5 but with ASICS I wear a 10 which fits and feels perfect. I'm thinking of ordering another pair.",
            "Loved the colorway and styling! Great support and traction - I do lots of lunges in the gym. And it seems durable so far.",
            "Great shoe for lifting weights or crossfit. They are just way too narrow",
            "Decent all around trainer, but after a year have decided to invest into separate lifting and running shoes. The do run a bit narrow and short, but not as big of an issue as some make them appear.",
            "Really like these shoes they're all-day comfortable for me. They are on the narrow side - even for me and I have regular/slightly narrow width feet. I like that she shoes are super light, I hardly notice I'm wearing them. Would definitely buy again.",
            "These shoes are excellent for weight training and general exercise in the gym. They have a solid base that is stable during squats and a low stack height with minimal heel drop so you are closer to the ground for deadlifts. These shoes make for an excellent alternative to other minimalist lifting shoes that have giant toe boxes, and give someone with a narrow foot a better option",
            "these shoes are great for workouts in the gym and for going on long walks.",
            "Narrow toebox!!! The original Gel Fortius TR fits perfectly at size 7.5, but size 7.5 TR 2 crushes my forefoot with the narrow toebox.",
            "Great as a naked/ minimal/ minimus trainer. Purchased my second pair. Love them",
            "These shoes get noticed. Often called different but are comfortable",
            "After reading all the reviews saying that these shoes were narrow I still went ahead and bought them. They are narrow even after going a size up. They seem well made and look good, but I can't wear them for more than an hour at a time and will definitely not be working out in them.",
            "shoes fit well and look great. sized the same as the Vans I wear daily",
            "only good for people with a narrow foot. If you have a wide foo, like me, this shoe will not be a good fit for you",

            "I had the Gel Fortius TR 1, and this fits just a tad bit smaller. They didn't work out for me, but still feel like a good functional fitness shoe.",
            "I have narrow feet and these shoes fit better than most. I use them with orthotics and I was able to slip them in easily, even though the shoe is just slightly more narrow than the orthotic insert. The shoes do have a cylindrical shape when looking down on them as a previous post had mentioned.",
            "I usually wear a size 12 but i wanted theses to be snug so i got an 11.5 and they are tight but i think they will be nice after they break in. Very stiff soles make them great for heavy lifting. They are sort of narrow shoes may not be for wide feet.",

            "Good shoe, had to order a size larger. The first pair was a 9.5, exchanged for a 10 and was good to go.",
            "I have narrow feet, always an 8 in Asics products. These are not only too narrow, they are too short. Ugh, I thought I was getting a good deal, what a waste.",
            "The first 2 workouts they were a little tide now the fit nice the perfect training shoes",
            "Great training shoe, but obviously not for all day wear.",
            "Excellent. Thought it was too tight but stretched to fit perfectly. Bought them to do beachbody videos...Beast, P90x3.",
            "Super narrow. I'm hoping they stretch a bit. Otherwise they feel pretty good.",
            "My husband was needing a good shoe for his wide feet and bottom of foot growths. Since starting wear these the growths have reduced in size.",
            "Overall good training sneaker. Durable and ergonomic design. They run a little narrow to fit like a glove.",
            "Overall a good shoe. They are a bit narrower my foot",
            "Great shoes. I got them for weight training and treadmill sprints. I needed a shoe with less heel cushion and no offset. These shoes did not disappoint. I was concerned that they would be too narrow for my slightly wider foot but they turned out to be perfect. I wasn't sure if I would like the grey and blue coloring, but after seeing them in person, I think they are stylish. As for my weight training, they are perfect. No cushiony bounce and more of a natural foot feel.",
            "Good shoe to workout in. Runs smaller than other ASICS shoes.",
            "Fast shipping! They are a little narrow but I haven't broke them in yet",

            "Liked them so much I purchased a 2nd pair so I can rotate them.",
            "These are a great show for the gym and and sprints. They are a little narrow in the toe, but once they have been broken in they are quite comfortable.",
            "Crazy narrow in size 15. Love the design really with they fit.",
            "Comfortable shoe for working out, but does run on the narrow side.",
            "Way too tight on my feet, says 11.5 but definitely doesn't feel like it's right at all",
            "Just needed a gym trainer shoe with a less-pronounced sole structure and light-weight from cross-training and such...this shoe fits the bill.",
            "Very narrow on the feet and slightly uncomfortable. Once broken in they are fine but not the most comfortable training shoe",
            "Really good if ur lifting weight cause of the flat bottoms but the glue is starting to wear and bottom is coming off at spots like vans other than that love them.",
            "I bought these mostly as casual shoes so I wear them for hours on end. At first, they feel comfortably skin tight. However, after a couple of hours my feet (across the toes) begin to ache reminding me how my brother used to roll my knuckles in a tight handshake when we were kids. I literally can't wait to get them off. I thought they would stretch out but it's been nearly a month and no such improvement yet. Otherwise, the soles have little padding while providing a good grip.",
            "I dont know how return the shoes so i will wait for a price drop en the next size. i order a 10.5 us shoe anf fits tight, reading all reviews I need to try the next size (11us). Un the past a tight shoe only hurt my toe and in jumping stuff surely that going to happened. I wish amazo\u0301n sell me the pair that i need at the same price that i bought this pair. This shoe is size smaller, i feel this one like 10us, no room for extra space is just like a sock.",
            "I buy Asics all the time and these run a little narrow compared to others I've had.",

            "disappointingly narrow, too narrow. Not comfortable on toe joint, which would eventually cause injury.",
            "Didn't take long to break in. I have been wearing Asics Onitsuka Tigers for EVERYTHING, so these were an excellent transition for workout shoes.",
            "i am sure the product is fine. My foot is just too wide and the fit was very snug. I have a triple E and even going up a 1/2 a size the fit was very tight.",
            "Great shoes, I will probably purchase a pair for my son!",
            "Very narrow in the front. Uncomfortable. I sent them back.",
            "Not meant for arch spport good for lifting and are really comfortable they run narrow.",
            "Very comfortable. Felt great on the first workout. Slightly odd looking but, but they're growing on me!",
            "Wonderful leg day shoes. The bottoms are completely flat. The material is very breathable and really lightweight.",
            "Toe box seems tighter then my other Asics running shoes.",
            "I love the shoe but should have ordered 10 M or D",
            "Use them for lifting. Pro: The foot bed/arch is very supportive. Cushioning is minimal, so when under weight you don't feel spongy. Con: The offset laces are an acquired look. The upper material is not designed to breath. At 40 degrees it's hot. Can't wait for the summer. Three months later: The shoe is too narrow. The synthetic material does not give. Too painful to wear everyday.",
            "These are great shoes, exactly what I expected. If you wear Asics as a norm you will be happy",
            "So far so good. Need to wear them in a little longer to know for sure.",
            "Bottom Line: - I like the idea of this design, but the overall fit is too narrow for most people. - Performs somewhat like a minimalist shoe. - Looks good, but could use a color option: Earth Tone which hides dirt better. - Performs well for weight lifting and short-mid distance running. Modification suggestions: - Smoothen the heel transition with the upper shoe. - Add material to connect the sole with the upper laces to provide a natural medial arch support during foot movement. - Thin out the tongue by 40-50% for more comfort.",
            "Way too narrow. Does not allow foot to splay out as needed for a cross training work out",
            "I like the shoes a lot, but just this morning I noticed the seam above my toe already beginning to separate. I work out six days a week and have had them for only about four weeks so this was a disappointment. I expect a 30 dollar pair of shoes to wear out this fast, but not a 90 dollar pair.",
            "Love them- my dead lift went up and my stance/form is perfect! Had been rolling up on the ball of my foot- not anymore!\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude0a",
            "This are great shoes for every day used and of course for weight lifting or cross training. They have great traction and good support when lifting, cant comment on longevity since i only had then for a week.",
            "They are ugly. The middle being gray looks strange. Wish i never bought them Going to give them away to charity",
            "Hoping these would be some light-weight gym shows, but they are too narrow.",
            "I have bought many Asics shoes. I always wear Asics to the gym. I always wear a size 12. I ordered a 12. Too small. Exchanged for a 12.5. Too small. Crazy. My dress shoes are 11.5. I have never bought anything bigger than a 12 before.",
            "Very poor fit. Not comfortable. Not a lot of foot support. Not the usual Asics qualitiy.",
            "Good shoe. Snug, well made. The only con is that the inside side of the shoe is grey and extremely hideous. This isnt pictured so it was dissapointing to receive them and see this ugly grey... whoever approved this design needs to approve their resignation.",
            "This watch is sleek and absolutely beautiful. It gets the job done. I'm definitely going to go back and get some more.",

They appreciated its sturdy weightlifting platform, flexibility, durability, arch support, and design. Despite all the praises heaped onto the shoe, there were also a few disgruntled purchasers who found the product short-lived and the fit too tight. That said, it was still considered as a great training shoe. Many fitness buffs lauded the versatility of the Asics Gel Fortius 2 TR the shoe performed well in a wide range of workouts, including CrossFit, weightlifting, dance cardio classes, and short-distance running Plenty of weightlifters liked that the trainer\u2019s firm support helped in improving their weightlifting stance A lot of buyers found the design and the colorways to be pleasing to the eyes The shoe also boasted of solid arch support, according to wearers with high arches A majority of the consumers lamented the narrow and tight fit of the trainer Two reviewers have reported that the footwear fell apart after only several weeks of gym use",
            "random_reference": "Great choice for challenging and shifting terrain. Many hikers praise the immediate comfort. Expensive but well-engineered. Unique three-level lacing system Relatively short break-in period Lightweight and exceptionally water-resistant Sole and seam separation is a common complaint Finding an ideal size is challenging Laces tend to loosen over time",
            "modular_llama3": "These athletic shoes have a durable design, great traction, and stiff soles suitable for heavy lifting, but concerns about longevity due to reported issues with the glue wearing off and seams separating. They are generally considered comfortable, breathable, and lightweight, ideal for cross-training, gym activities, and weightlifting. However, they have minimal cushioning, may not be suitable for running, and have a narrow fit that can cause discomfort for those with wider feet. The shoes require break-in time but provide a stable base, good grip, and great support once they mold to the foot. While they have little arch support, they offer excellent stability and traction for workouts and lifting. The appearance is a matter of personal preference, with some users disliking the grey interior. Overall, these shoes are ideal for those with narrow feet who prioritize support and stability for heavy lifting and gym activities.",

They are not ideal for running due to lack of flexibility and amortization. Recommended for those with narrow feet and for specific activities like weightlifting and short-distance running, but may not be suitable for all-day wear or cross-training.",

            "modular_gpt4": "These shoes have a mixed reception, excelling in certain aspects while lacking in others. They're praised for their breathable material (save for the upper), ergonomic design, and durability, although there are concerns about the glue and seams not holding up well. Notably, they provide excellent stability and support for weight training due to their stiff soles and minimalist design, but lack cushioning, making them hard on the knees and unsuitable for running. The narrow fit is a recurring issue, often causing discomfort such as cramped toes and blisters. While some find the fit improves over time or with orthotics, many advise ordering a half size larger. Overall, these shoes are ideal for heavy lifting, but their narrow design and lack of padding might hinder comfort for extended wear and broader feet."

Now he's the type of little guy takes off everything even his diapers , but he kept on these boots in dance all night. In slept in them. Now I have to figure out how can I bribe him with something else. Because he not getting in the freaking tib with these boots. In cookies , candies , juice won't help in these the things he loves. So u know these boots are great if your kids don't want them off lol \ud83d\udc62\ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\ude02",
            "Bought these for work; they are the only work shoes I've worn for years. They are also the only shoes I can wear all day (typically 15 hours) and not be crippled. All other shoes hurt my feet (and in turn my back- I have disc issues) after only a couple of hours. I even wear them on weekends if I know I'm going to be doing a lot of walking. All in all, they are extremely comfortable. I buy them a little big so I can wear multiple pairs of socks in winter (work outdoors), and even then they're not too tight. Love my Timberlands!",
            "I love this shoe.... So does my son. It's comfy and sleek easy to clean and paired with the no tie laces a breeze. Durable, my 9yr old uses it for school and it stands up to the kicking of rocks and running and jumping about he does. Will recommend anyday. Delivery was quick and what I ordered was what I got.",
            "I bought these for my Sunday 6 very well he loves them and they are strong durable perfect for outdoor hiking and where in snow",
            "Got this for my kid, he likes em, can't say its his favorite shoes, but he wears em when it snows. Fits well, quality is good. Shoe laces come loose almost every time, at first I thought it was kids fault, tied myself, still get loose... go figure. Have not been hiking or anywhere outdoors, all day walk around in snowy weather is the most use they have seen, held well.",
            "This hiker boot is amazing! but it runs small, its great for trecking through wooded areas not so great for deepsnow somewhat great for cold though. this item came on time and with no damage but had to return it because it was the right size but to small because it runs small .",

She said they were very comfortable and she never complained about discomfort, despite the fact that we walked a lot on a recent trip. It was also hot at times where we were on vacation and she never complained that the boots felt hot (and she would, if they were).",

I honestly think they're even cuter in person than in the picture. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because I wasn't thrilled about spending $60 on boots for a 5 year old but I have to admit the quality is great so they're worth it in my opinion. His old Tim's still look great, he's just outgrown them so if you're looking for boots that will last for quite a while you found them.",

            "These seem like a good quality shoe. I ordered a size 1 for my son, that is the size he wears. I read some other reviews that stated the shoes fit as expected, but the 1 was very tight on him. We kept the shoes for my younger son. I would recommend ordering at least a half size up. We went with the 2.5 and he has a half inch growing room. Both of my boys love the shoes.",

For a perfect fit I should have ordered a size 6, but instead i ordered a 6.5 afraid that they would be too small. With this boot I will have to use thick socks or two pairs-which isn't really bad if we get a very cold winter.

            "My 12 year old son is a pain when it comes to school shoes. There's a rule that they must be plain black. He will not wear \"sensible\" shoes (Clarks and the like) because all his mates wear \"trainer\" type shoes. Well trainers are difficult to keep clean and I was so glad to find these Converse shoes. They're leather and therefore polishable. They're American and so I expected good quality. They're smart and as I understand it from Junior, comfortable. Most of all, I didn't have to fall out with my son over the choice of shoe because we both agree that these are perfect.",
            "The shoes arrived ahead of time. My daughter is delighted with them .These are her second pair of the same style that she wears to school. She had her orevious pair for 1 year & she walks 30 minutes each way to school daily.So I consider that they have worn well. If anything I feel the fit of these is better, as they now have a arch support, which in the past has been my only negative point about them.So converse have improved the support.",

            "I bought these for wearing to work as we have a smart-casual dress code, so they are suitably neat, but not over-formal. They are just classic converse in full black leather. I've had them six months or so, and the leather has got beautifully supple. I suspect the soles are going to go in the same amount of time usual converse do which for me is around two years. However, for full leather shoes I thin this is still pretty good value; and they are really comfy. Oh, and I've had quite a lot of good comments from people which is always nice :-D",
            "Love it!! Nice looking, comfortable, stylish and best of all it's leather which I always wanted!! I'm a 'Big foot and the Henderson' size 8 and my 14 year old daughter is feeling envious, I caught her wearing it yesterday and she's a size 6......like really!!",
            "As well as being too large, seem to be very long shoes. One of the leather shoes was scratched and marked on two separate areas. I did not look at the small print as returns are not free and I had to pay to send them back. Waiting for my refund at the moment.",
            "Ok so I am a fan of Converse, and usually have 3 or 4 pairs on the go at any one time, and as usual these do the job magnificently. Classic, timeless and cool, they are never out of fashion and if only they found a way to make them last longer they would be perfect.",
            "The shoes were bought as a gift for my partner who (not to be unkind) has unusually sized feet and is at time difficult to buy for; fortunately this brand and shoe fits perfect. In addition my partner loves the style and quality of the leather version which I have pervious owned also. All in all great shoe from a great seller, competitively priced in the market, with swift and cheap delivery service = Very happy customer.",

            "These shoes run super small! I bought 2 sizes larger than what my son normally wears. They look enormous, but when worn with a thicker sock, they fit him fine. However, they are super clunky and somewhat heavy. The sole/tread is much wider than a regular shoe. Not sure how comfortable they are for running and playing, but for occasional winter wear, I think they are fine. In the picture, the Keen Kootenay boot in size 10 is on the left and the Keen Peek a Shoe in size 9 is on the right. They fit my son about the same.",
            "This is our second pair of these and we LOVE them. My son is 8 and I hate sending him to school in big clunky snowboots when it's cold but not particularly snowy. These are PERFECT for those days, and they're so comfortable he often keeps them on at school all day (doesn't even bother to change into his sneakers). A must-have for us every winter.",
            "I love these hiking boots for my preschool aged boys! They can get them on without assistance and wear them all day without complaining. They run a little on the small side and I bought a size bigger and that worked great for us. They are tighter in the ankles, because they're hiking boots, so one of my kids had to get used to that feeling, but it's been a couple months and they love them! They clean up miraculously- even after being completely covered in black mud. Ask me how I know.",
            "Easy Velcro and Warm These are perfect for slipping on when camping, or running to the mailbox. They are comfortable enough to wear all day. This is my 2nd pair. The first ones lasted 5+ years but they are worn out. I wear a size 7 ladies and I got a 6 youth which will work great with warm socks.",
            "This is our third pair, replaced only because of size changes. Really great boots for outdoor loving kids. My daughters wear them near daily. They have been through tons and tons of mud and have held up wonderfully. They keep them warm and dry. When they have been submerged in knee deep mud, they washed easily by hand and dried over the heater without change in shape or fit. Highly recommended!",
            "Great shoe! Recommend protecting them before use. Better looking and more comfortable option for a boys winter boot. Well made product as usual with Keen. Good sturdy sole, but has the typical clunk of the chunky sole. Warm and offers just the right amount of gift to wear a heavy sock, but also a thin sock without the shoe loosing its snugness. Colors are great!",
            "Bought these for my 7 year old to use on a ski trip. The boots look and feel nicely made. My son is picky about shoes but he liked how these fit, which was a relief because other snow shoes he tried on were too stiff for him. He also gets cold easily but these boots kept his feet warm and dry.",
            "my daughter wore these for 2 seasons - wore them daily October thru April - and the seams are just now starting to come undone. they are awesome. the soles are still in great condition - I may just take them to a cobbler to reinforce the seams and donate them since my daughter has out grown them.",
            "Great looking boot, love it. My grandson wears toddler 8, I purchased 9 and it is too small on a normal thin sock. If anyone cares, weight of 1 boot size toddler 9 is 7.7 oz (220 g), inside length is 6\u201d, widest part of sole is 3.5\u201d (looks a little bit too wide)",
            "I love these shoes. I have a pair that are three years old. In trying to buy a new pair, I have bought three different ones and none of them fit right! I measured them against my old pair and they look like they should fit, but they're slightly too small. My toes feel crunched inside. Another pair I bought in the same size as my old ones was a 1/2 inch too long! I don't think Keen is sticking to a sizing chart anymore.",
            "Ok I put \"fit as expected\" because the first time I ordered these, I ordered the same size as my son's Keen shoes--which are already a size bigger. But the boots were waaaaay too small. I ordered 2 sizes larger, and these seem to get on ok. A little loose, but he'll grow into them. So definitely, order 1-2 sizes larger than normal for your child.",
            "It's a bit heavy but so does all winter shoes so it's ok. My 3yr old boy chose this over other winter shoes. The material is very durable. Especially the toe kick is well protected for a toddler boy who runs around a lot.",
            "We purchased these for my toddler granddaughter who has very wide feet and a high arch. They are a size bigger than we would normally have purchased but they seem to do the trick. Reviews for these said that they run a bit small. She can get her foot in and out and with a thicker sock they'll be fine.",
            "These are nice looking and well made- however the sizing on the boots we got really confuses me. I ordered a whole size larger than my son currently wears and he says they are too small/tight. A friend also purchased these boots (same size) for her child with larger feet than my child and she has no problems.",
            "I got these for my almost 2 year old. He wears a size 7 right now and I got these in 8 so he would be able to wear them for the entire winter season. It's very difficult to get his foot in the shoe. You have to really jam it in there. We had these last year and they worked a bit better. Not sure why. Haven't used these in bad seasonal conditions yet. But I hope they'll perform as well as the ones last year.",
            "These are great boots that appear very well made, but sadly I have to return them. When you order items like this online, you rely on reviews to help you with choosing the right size based on how it fits on others. I went up a full size for my 8 yo son who wears a 5 (big kid). He is swimming in them! It appears that it might just be the toddler sizes that are running small. If your child is in the big kid sizes, I suggest ordering true to size.",
            "Got these for our granddaughter and she loves them. They seem to be well built and made to last, which is good as we picked a color that could be handed down to her younger brother as well. Perfect boot for our climate and weather for a little first grader.",
            "I love these shoes for my little guy but they are on the small, he wears a 9 and the 9s in these were almost an inch too small, I have reordered an 11, I am hoping it fits perfectly before it warms up!",
            "I love the boots, but they are off by an entire size at least. Ordered 8s for my daughter who wears a 6.5, after she outgrew the 7s I had bought at the beginning of the winter.",
            "I buy these shoes for my three boys every year. They are the perfect thing for rainy Pacific Northwest weather. They are heavy duty, but lightweight and keep my kids feet dry. Plus, they are easy on, easy off with the Velcro tab. LOVE THEM!",
            "My 6 yr old is so hard on shoes. I love these and so does he. They still look brand new after a few months of wearing them. (Did I mention he is hard on shoes) They also keep his feet warm and dry in the snow without having to wear is heavy snow boots. I love them!",
            "Based on other reviews, ordered a whole size up. The warm lining inside narrows it a bit, so sizing up allows sock allowance. These are great on my two year old and keep her toes warm and dry. They seem a little heavy but she never complained. The solid toe is a must with a toddler!",
            "Very cute. My kids like them. Each kid got a pair. They are a bit bulky, but I also bought a size larger than they are currently in, so that probably plays into that.",
            "VERY LIGHT i like them but the sizes are a little smaller than expected I took size 9 for my boy and he needs 10 with these so i will send them back and buy again. very happy seems very strong and warm",
            "Great shoe but the 10t was too small and the other pair too big. Grandson needs 10.5 t. The shoe looked well made.",
            "My son loves these boots. I bought him faux hiking boots from Carter's and he put a hole in them within a few weeks. He's tough on shoes. I decided to invest in real boots and always look to Keen for rugged and durable styles but with comfort in mind. The most annoying thing about these boots is trying to guess the size. My son wears about an 11.5 right now and I had to get a 13 for them to fit comfortably. Go up at least 1 size if not 2!",
            "Great shoes for winter and young kids! My son can wear these to and from the bus and school. He also can wear these all day at school. We have had these type of boots for the past three years and consider them a must have for winter. These run small but color, material are great.",
            "Got to try these in the snow for the first time today and they worked very well. Warm and waterproof.",
            "The look and colors are great, however the sizing is off. My son wears size 10 little kid, I bought size 11 of these and they were too small. Disappointed.",
            "Bought these shoes for my 10 year old and at first they looked great but definitely on a bulky/heavier side. Kid wore it for about a week and the bottom sole started to slowly un-glue from the top portion of the shoe so we've decided to return these shoes. Rather disappointed with overall durability of these shoes.",
            "My daughter has slightly wide feet, so Keens are a great fit for her. She is pretty picky about shoes but she loves these ankle boots!",
            "Did fit large, but I love the quality. My son loves these shoes and is easy for him to put on.",
            "I am taking away one star for being a bit bulky. My daughter got used to it and likes wearing them we are yet to test it in the snow!! Will update once we do! Shoes are very well made and seems to be warm and comfy just what we needed.",
            "Love the material. They are warm and comfortable. They look durable .gr8 buy",
            "I am buying these boots for 2 years in a row for my son. They seem to be comforyable and warm enough for NYC, but not too heavy or bulky. He must wear sneakers to school, and these boot were comfortable both indoors and outside.",
            "I like the boots, but they run somewhat wide and bulky. My 10 years old son was tripping while trying them on and walking a little bit around the room. Also, they are kind of girly looking. Had to return.",
            "These are the best shoes I ever bought for my son. And they're his favorite . I bought another pair since, for my other son. They're so sturdy and well made. Best quality !",
            "Love these boots! Stylish, warm, waterproof, and easy to slip on quickly!",
            "nice waterproof leather, good quality. Runs somewhat small, and boots are somewhat hard.",
            "This is our third Pair of Keen shoes in this style. They are a bit heavy but offer great protection in cold climates. My son is very picky with shoes/boots and he loves these. The rubber tip is rugged and protects the feet in both rain and snow, and is excellent on playgrounds. These shoes last forever! And they ARE comfortable as far as shorts boots go. I buy them a size bigger that his regular size and they always fit just right (over a slightly thicker winter sock).",
            "Good quality and great fit. I took a size bigger - my girl is size 7 and I bought 8 just to have a little extra room. She loves them! I was afraid it will be bulky and heavy and they are not. Great buy",
            "I have ordered my son a pair of these 4 yrs in a row. He loves them!",
            "Bought these for my 5 year old - he absolutely loves them. Heavier then his sneakers, but he can run and play comfortably. He says they are very warm and comfy. Easy to get on and off is a bonus.",
            "Too hard to get the feet in. Even if you get your feet in, you can't walk because they are too tight. Both kids refused to wear them after trying them on and asked me to return them to \"prime\".",
            "These boots are awesome. They are a staple in my sons winter wardrobe. He swears they are just as comfortable as his tennis shoes. They are our go to boot!!!",
            "Way too heavy and inflexible for toddler feet. Well made though. Had to return.",
            "This shoe is perfect especially for my child who does not know how to ties his shoe laces yet. Strong and durable shoes.",
            "wonderful colours... expected keen fit and finish... size 6 fits my women's 7 1/2 feet just fine... super fun in soggy weather",
            "GREAT BOOTS. Limited Ankle support which makes me very nervous. i try to strap the Velcro as tight as possible. these Boots should have ties with how heavy duty they are. Great boots overall!",
            "Durable warm kids boots. Perfect for preschool playing in the fall and winter on the playground",
            "Great, waterproof boots that don't produce the heat of tall boots, yet keep out moisture. These are our go-to winter shoe choice!",
            "Bought these for a two year old. They were not really too small, but it's really hard to get their foot in the shoe. I love Keens, and always buy for my granddaughters in the summer. These look really nice, but way too difficult to put on.",
            "i wanted to love these, but they were too wide for my girls, who have low volume feet. the quality is fantastic, though.",
            "what a great shoes for little explorers. i bought those for my 2yr old daughter. These shoes kept her warm and dry throughout the fall/winter season of New England weather. highly recommend.",
            "Had these for my now three year old last year and loved them. Perfect fall/winter all weather boots. Keene are the best!",
            "the shoe itself is great warm but the size is to small. my daugther is size 9 1/2 i ordered a 10 it fit her just right but i returned it because i needed room for thicker socks and room to grow",
            "Looks good so far. My so. Haven\u2019t try it yet.",
            "I love this little boots but the size runs way too small. I order 2 sizes bigger for my girl and they still don't fit. She normally wears a 1 to 1.5 and so I order a 3 and they did not fit. way to small.",
            "Awesome! Bought for a camping trip -- worked great and we are still using them for hiking and fishing and all that good stuff that kids go and do.",
            "I really like these shoes. They don't really work for snow play because they are not high enough but they do work for running errands, etc.",
            "Previous years have been great. This year is NOT water proof.",
            "I have bought a pair of these Keen Winter Boots for my grandson for the last 3 years. They are comfortable, light weight and yet hold up great- easy for them to get on and off! Would highly recommend them- worth the price",
            "Great shoes will enjoy them when snow come. I recommend buying them.",
            "Not the warmert but certainly the coolest snow boots. Easy to slip on.",
            "Have held up very well so far on my little guy.",
            "Great looking boot. Like others have said: sizing is way off. Size 9 kootenay insole is same length as size 8 stride rite insole (but the toe box is wider on the keen). Other than sizing being off, it's a great shoe!",
            "These shoes are really great! Warm, comfy, and totally waterproof. The only drawback is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but I guess you can't do better for a snow boot.",
            "Good quality but why so wide? They make my four year olds feet like unnaturally wide.",
            "My son had a similar pair when he was 3 - 4 yo and they still looked great after he had out-grown them. I was excited to see the same boot in his size as a 9 yo. They're stylish, durable and work well for that winter boot just below the level of big snow boots.",
            "Confotable. Not cute for girl. But I want her to have confortable and warm shoes to go to school.",
            "This is my grandson's second pair. He loves them. They are sturdy and comfortable in all kinds of weather.",
            "It's a good boot, I can say instead of shoes. Easy to wear and easy to taking off. My son love it very much. The out sole is durable and avoid slip. Believe KEEN's quality. Will go and see the performance in winter weathers.",

            "Mert my expectations, just because it has some like plush inside it will need to buy one size bigger than you need",
            "Great little shoe, we just didn't get any snow this year",

            "Very cute and stylish !! Grandson just loved them !!!",
            "My 2 y.o. wore them every day for several months. We leave in Seattle, so our winder is relatively mild but wet. These boots are perfect for our climate, warm enough without being too warm and waterproof for everyday rain. They are very easy to put on and off, so a 2 y.o. could do it by himself. Shame kids feet grow fast, these boots are very study and durable and will last a few seasons of everyday wear. If you have more than one kid, they are a fantastic investment even at full price.",
            "I love them they are just what I wanted great In the snow. so easy to get on",
            "Great solid shoe, pricey for a kids shoe but worth it.",

            "Second pair for my son, a size bigger than last winter. The only boots that fit his high instep. After the whole season of hard wear the first pair looked almost like new and was handed to a younger friend.",
            "Buy them because a was going for or trip on january 22 to Hollywood studios, we had a very cold and rainy day for January 23 2016 where the weather in Magic kingdom was 6 centigrade. My 3 years old boy had a good time I didn't worry a bit. We returned 11am with a very cold weather . I'm a 100% satisfied customer.",

            "We love these shoes for my kids! They are the best shoes for snow and cold weather. Great on icy areas. My son outgrows these before they even have any signs of wear. These are so well made!",
            "Really nice great quality only thing is the size was a little small. My daughter being 3 likes to be in anything messy. She got the new size went to the dog park played in puddles came home rinsed off and still dry inside and her feet were warm. We will be getting these again.",
            "My daughter doesn't like her feet to be overly warm. These would be perfect if they were not fur lined.",
            "Nice looking boots, tough and flexible, exactly what my boy needs.",

            "Keen is the only toe box wide enough for my boy. Loved them so much over the last several years both boys now wear them. These are pretty durable. The velcro is the only thing we ever had an issue with, but not enough to deter anouther purchase. Own their sandals, koven and several of these boots. Would recommend. They have fit true to size for 8 year old but I buy bigger for 10 year old that has a wider foot.",
            "im happy to have purchased these Keen boots for my 4 year old. They do run small. He's a size 11 but I ordered a 12 and they fit him nicely with just a little extra room. He loves them and can put them on himself and do the Velcro strap. Keen is a well known brand, reputable, waterproof and it's a very nice looking boot. I purchased the brown. My only concern is that his feet get hot in the boot and I don't see odor shield protectant as in some other kids shoes. Otherwise, I would look to purchase this brand again.",

Wider fit which is great for my son's wide feet. soft supporting bottom, flexible. Water proof and warm. My son loves wearing them. These are the 2nd pair. When he grows out of them, I will buy a size up.",
            "This is our second time ordering this style of boots for our son. I am always impressed by the quality and comfort of Keen's. Would definitely recommend these boots!",
            "The front rubber part came lose after wearing just 3 times.... :(",
            "If you have ever owned a pair of Keen's you know the quality of their products, outstanding. This is the third pair of children's Kootenay winter boots that I've purchased for my kiddo and he loves them and I definitely love them too. Before we had these boots, I had him wear those huge, half-way up the leg snow boots. It was so hard for my kiddo to get around in those clunkers!",
            "Great Shoes for my little guy. They are comfortable to play both outdoors or indoors, and keep his little feet warm in the snow. They ARE truly waterproofed, as he has played with them in the heavy snow, but his feet have never gotten wet. I have found that we have not been using snow boots now that he wears these shoes. He loves them, and wants to wear them all the time. The Velcro closure makes it easy for him to put on and take off. I highly recommend.",
            "I have been using the shoes of Keen for mu son. I am very content with them. They are terrific!",
            "My daughter loves these shoes. Warm, comfy, easy for her to put on and off herself.",
            "order 1 size up. it was too small for our kid.",
            "I love the quality of Keen in this cute winter boot.",
            "As I wanted them! But needed them obe size bigger than usual.",
            "Bought for my 7 year old. He likes them, they do run a bit large though. The toe box is very wide. Seems like they are well made.",
            "This is the third pair that we have purchased for our son who is now nearly 5 years old. He' s been wearing this particular shoe since he was 2! These are slightly wide shoes, which has been great for his feet. They are sturdy, weather and water proof, good looking and easy for him to put on himself. Our favorite kid's shoe by far!!",
            "Nice shoes. My 8 years old son like it very much.",
            "I love these shoes on my toddler. But the sizing is all off. My advise would be to go up 2 sizes. They are expensive enough and they work. They keep my little ones feet warm and dry. I like these over the water resistant ones, I'll spend the extra $ on these. But then I live in a rainy climate so waterproof is necessary. They are a little tricky to get on, but I think it's getting easier the more she wears them. They do look cute with a dress. I ordered the next size up as well for probably next month when she outgrows these ones.",
            "For my 3 year old toddler... I should have ordered the next size up. But other then that, they are nice shoes."

While they are generally comfortable and suitable for outdoor activities, some users find them hard to put on, and the boots can be too stiff for toddlers.

            "A little narrow but as you wear them They soon stretch out to be just Wright. I also have a wide foot. besides that they are perfect original manufacturer quality look great this is the fourth pair of Reebok Z shoes that I bought not disappointed at all first time buying shoes off of Amazon happy with the purchase",
            "I am exceptionally hard to satisfywhen it comes to shoes. I have been consistently pleased by Reebok. These shoes are great. Very comfortable, with plenty of room for heavier socks should the weather turn.",
            "I have long, narrow feet and I like a good arch. Reebok are the only shoes that fit right. They're nice-looking shoes, durable and of obvious good quality, and they feel great.",
            "Arrived on time. Fit perfectly, and true to fit. They don't run small like Nike or big like Adidas. Buy the correct size...no need to size up or down. My son says they are the most comfortable athletic shoes he has ever worn. Great price too.",
            "As the title explains I have been a wearer of reebok zig style running shoes for awhile. Generally these shoes are well constructed however the eyelets are not reinforced like in previous models (maybe to save weight) but it does make the shoe feel cheaper. The insides and toe are reinforced though but my problem has always been on the outside developing a hole by my little toe. My biggest complaint though is even though I ordered the same size they run slightly larger an issue I could deal with in everyday shoes but for running this is going to be an issue and I might end up donating this pair",
            "I've walked a few miles in these shoes, comfortable out of the box, felt a little tight in the midstep , very light, really nice, comfortable shoe for hiking. One issue I had, the gap in the sole collects various debris when trail walking, small issue, otherwise very happy with my purchase.",
            "I've been buying Reebok Zig Tech running shoes for years now for their quality, durability and ARCH SUPPORT. I have high arches and it's difficult to find shoes with good arch support. My last pair of Men's ZigWild Tr 2's lasted for 3 years. They are just now starting to wear out on the inside. I just purchased this 5.0 version as a replacement. No one is saying that they don't have arch support!! They also do not look like they were constructed with the same attention to quality. Lace eyelets are definitely lower quality. I returned them and am looking for an alternative.",
            "Shoeaholic here...this style is my all-time favorite. New puppy got ahold of my older pair and I just couldn\u2019t be without them. I have a narrow foot and need arch support...my feet just feel good when I\u2019m wearing these. I do think these are ever-so-slightly larger, but not enough to go down a half size.",
            "As a Reebok fan since 1987, I am happy to say this shoe does not disappoint! The big seller for me is the Zig Technology design. I wanted something I could run AND hike in separately. On this count, I gladly give it 5 stars. It could use a little more arch support but after walking in them over a mile, this was a not an issue. In general I prefer my Merrell shoes to hike in but these Reeboks are awesome shoes. I NEED to get another pair!",
            "This will be my 5th pair of this style of zig-tech shoes, just slightly varied colors. I absolutely LOVE these shoes and wish they were more readily available. They're extremely comfortable, especially out of the box. The sole lasts for a good long time before it wears down, and the shoes are very durable. I work a job that involves a lot of restraining of people when they get out of control so they get stomped on all of the time and yet still hold up great. Lastly, they're very fairly priced. 10/10. I'm going to be really upset when these aren't available anymore.",
            "I bought these to wear for work because I'm on my feet for long periods of time. These shoes have helped quite a bit with the fatigue my feet were feeling with my previous pair of shoes. There's a memory foam insole which is nice and soft on the feet. I replaced the laces with some of the rubber laces you can find on Amazon, and those apply the perfect amount of force on my foot to keep it comfortable and also keep the shoes from slipping.",
            "Past sneaker purchases I have to get used to the fit an whatever bells and whistles, but these have been the exception for me. Shoes are super comfortable an able to take what I dish out over the last few weeks with little wear. Very happy with this purchase!",
            "I just bought this shoe and it's comfortable, but buyer beware: Not all size 10 1/2's are created equal. I had been wearing ASICS shoes, of which I wear a size 10 1/2, which is a size 44.5 in Europe. The Reebok size 10 1/2 is size 44 in Europe. While this doesn't seem like a big deal, this Reebok shoe is narrower (must be what the .5 difference is) than my old ASICS running shoes and thus feels too small. Otherwise, the shoe looks cool and feels about as comfortable as a shoe that's 1/2 size too small can be expected to feel.",
            "The only shoes my husband wears for work. He walks a lot, comparable to running daily and the shoes last awhile and remain comfortable. These were cheaper than the in-store exact pair and we also ordered here because 2 stores said they had them in stock but were, in fact, out of stock.",
            "I bartend and if you're looking for a shoe that provides comfort for 8+ hours on cement floors then these are great! They're not slip resistant but if your know what your doing then you can move around on wet floors without falling.",
            "Still one of the most comfortable shoes ever. At 6ft 1in 260lbs, I tend to go through shoes pretty fast. Only drawback is they're starting to fall apart after a couple weeks! Just the soles though, shop im going to pick up some shoo goo cause im not sending them back!!",
            "I bought these back in April. Run one hour a day in them. And still am loving them. Good fit and traction on the trails. The are more comfortable than the day I bought them but otherwise show very little ware.",
            "This are great shoes if you are on your feet all day on concrete. My lower back use to hurt from stand all day but after getting these shoes and super feet insoles it has minimized my lower back pain. The shoes hold up ok. If you have the shoe to loose the inside of the shoe wears out and gets holes in the fabric. I keep buying them because they help me out",
            "I'm not a runner but I walk 4-5 miles a day as part of my employment. These are very comfortable aalking shoes. They're not so good if you're just standing though. I'll be replacing these with a identical pair when it's time.",
            "I use these shoes for work, I work 7-7 12 hours a day a lot of walking I\u2019m a service advisor at a dealership. I use them after seeing a nurse wearing them I asked if they were good she said yes highly recommended them. So now was this was my 12th pair. Reebok zig techs highly recommended for all day use. Absorbs a lot of heel impact especially if you\u2019re flat footed like me.",
            "LOVE these shoes. I got these for gym workouts for more support on my ankles and these shoes are great! Awesome traction and extremely comfortable. I ordered the conversion size for women\u2019s as I didn\u2019t like the colors offered in the woman\u2019s style of this shoe. The fit is perfect and will definitely buy these again!",
            "I love these shoes. If you are on your feet alot these are perfect. Also they last a while. I have a pair that is 2 years old and I just bought a new pair but the old ones are still in good shape. They fit a half size to big. I usually wear men's 11 but these 11s are a little big. Other than that amazing.",
            "These are the most comfortable shoes. Last long! Only bad thing is the recessed are in the heel will pick up stones/rocks. I wish they wouldn\u2019t have stopped making them.",
            "Not very durable as models in the past, mine are starting to peel away at the front and I only bought them in May, however they fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable",
            "The shoes have stood up to walking every day. They fit nicely and really support my body on impact when running. I recommend these shoes.",
            "I like the fact that I have finally found a sneaker that allows me to walk without being in pain due to having a cyst on the bottom of my foot. I bought a pair Nike Vapor Max\u2019s from the mall and they lasted all of 2-3 months before the loop that you put the shoe laces through snapped on me. So decided to go with Reebok as I have seen a few of my co-workers wear this style of sneaker.",
            "Great style, look, and price! A bit tight for my huge wide foot but I am happy over all and use them in the gym and for walking or standing in general use.",
            "Ordered these sneakers and I wanted women\u2019s size 7.5 which is what the items says it is. Mens size 7.5 was delivered. Returned the item and got a replacement. Wrote that 7.5 mens came and didn\u2019t order that. Today the replacement came and it was a mens 7.5 again!! Something must be wrong with the product description!",
            "Not as comfortable as previous versions of this shoe, soles are a harder plastic material and are not as cushiony as previous versions of this shoe.",
            "The only thing I dislike is that if you walk on gravel/small rocks they tend to get stuck in between the Z's. Otherwise, it's an extremely comfortable shoe.",
            "Love these shoes. Wish they would still make them because this design and the comfort is great. They fit to size so even better.",
            "I have been using this style of shoe for a couple of years and I can use them without arch supports with my very flat feet and they provide great support and comfort",
            "Great shoe. My husband liked them so much I ordered him a second pair to keep for later. My husband is very picky when it comes to shoes so these are definitely an A+. They are high quality and fit him perfect.",
            "Big guys need wider fits my husband told me it has good absorption but the insoles are narrow & can be annoying working & standing all day the insoles being narrow makes him kinda tired. But he willing to give the Zigzag brand another go but go for wider fits even though his feet don't look that wide he's well porportioned but is a big man 6'3 310 The absorption is really good worth another try",
            "Reebok's Zigwild is the most comfortable shoe I've owned in years. I'm on my feet for hours everyday and when I wear these I don't worry about my feet aching when I get home.",
            "This is a great shoe. I own several pair and wear them daily. I especially love them for travelling. Light weight but great support.",
            "This product description is incorrect. Per the inside tongue of the shoe, this is a MENS size 8 1/2 shoe, not a woman's size 8 1/2. A men's 8 1/2 is too large for me, so I had to return the product.",
            "I only run around 10 miles a week due to a bad back. These really help with the impact on my lower back. Definitely worth the money.",
            "I don't have to say much. I am on my second pair and I still wear my first pair when I don't want my new ones to get dirty.",
            "In the first two weeks the rubier in front start to pill off . The fabric is getting very quickly dirty with every sprinkle it leaves spots on it",
            "Really like the snug fit and lightweight feel of the shoes. Rocks do not get stuck on the bottom unlike my previous style. Looking forward to working out in these for hundreds of miles.",
            "This is my second pair. Use them for walking per added arch support. Wore the last pair out after 9 month, or about 850 miles (give or take)...",
            "Super comfortable. Not good for outdoor running since rocks and debris will def get stuck in the \u201czigs\u201d but for indoor these are great!",
            "Love these shoes. So comfortable I wish Reebok still made them. This is my 4th pair my favorite shoes ever",
            "These fit perfect and they are very light weight more than I could\u2019ve asked for And when I went to re-order a second pair the day that I got them the price doubled so I know I got a heckuva deal",
            "Best shoe ever sold.. I have owned over 10 pair and not has any back pain since the first set purchased",
            "Lightweight, comfortable and durable! I have used them to run everywhere on every surface and they hold up well! The construction and quality of materials used is superior to many shoes that I have paid more for. Excellent, quality pair of shoes!",
            "My husband loves these! I\u2019ve ordered 6 pair in the last 4 years. Please don\u2019t stop making them!!!",
            "These shoes are very comfortable and give my foot needed support. I am a basketball referee and do several games in a row, comfort and support are very important.",
            "Not bad but a bit stiff just needed to get broken in.",
            "Very comfortable shoe. I bought these shoes for work. I have a 10hr day and they are great!",
            "I do not recall EVER stepping into a more comfortable shoe! I've only had them for a week, so I can't really speak to the longevity of this shoe, but they definitely seem very well constructed and OH SO COMFORTABLE! Based on the way they look and feel, I would DEFINITELY buy them again!",
            "I will be buying a second pair soon....same color etc.",
            "I\u2019m a female runner, and didn\u2019t find my size 11 in these shoes for women, so I ordered a men\u2019s size 9, and they fit perfectly. I am very happy I got these! They give me the support I needed, the comfort, and boosted my daily walking/running goals! ZigWild Reebok shoes are fantastic!!",
            "Very happy with this purchase. Reebok's are the best shoes for my husband's back pain. Good price. Fast shipping",
            "These are amazing shoes, great to wear when I'm on my feet standing for 8+hrs or going for daily exercise (I go on long fast paced walks, not jogging. Highly recommend.",
            "Really like these shoes, I bought them to work out in and they were so comfortable I started using them for work, I'm on my feet all day and they feel great, now I need to get another pair to work out in. Only draw back is that if you walk on gravel they can get rocks stuck in the sole.",

            "The shoes feel amazing and the support is great. Its comfortable to work all day in and amazing for running and working out but within a couple of months it started tearing off from places. So the cloth material is very bad",

            "Love these shoes, the only shoes I like to run in",
            "Very comfortable shoes. These shoes fits a little tighter compared to other brands but I'm been using Reebok forever so if you're new then buy half size larger.",
            "They are not really comfortable, if you are standing or walking for 6 to 7 hours a day this shoes will start killing your feet after like 2weeks",
            "Had an old pair of Zigs that are worn out. Replace them with these.",
            "Good looking shoes but too small in toe box. Felt like half size to small",
            "Review is for Amazon fulfillment. Shipped men's size instead of women's. The line for returns at Kohl's has ten people deep, so apparently sucking is a pretty common occurrence.",
            "The soles of these shoes are not secured with quality materials. They fall apart with very minimal wear. It\u2019s very unfortunate because I find this design to be very comfortable.",
            "So far so good I'm into my third day , wearing at work today see how they handle. I like the fit it is a very nice fit nothing loose nothing too tight comfort I'm giving it 4.5 out of 5",

This is my second pair of the zig tech( which is what they were originally called when the came out) and I had my first pair for over 3 years. I only retired them because I had got them soaked and let them sit outside for over a year and decided I had enough shoes.
