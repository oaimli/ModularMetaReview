You are good at writing summaries for opinionated texts. You are given some opinionated text fragments, please write a concise summary for them.


Example input review fragments:

"1) **Evaluating different explanation techniques:**",
"We thus believe that our results do *not* violate the surmise made in the shared reference, but rather support it.",
"We believe this makes our findings generalizable.",
"Although, the paper brings out the importance of analogies as explanations (which further motivates our work)",
"The proposed technique is flexible as it can provide two forms of explanations: feature and analogy-based.",
"Moreover, explanations in the form of analogies are intuitive for human users.",
"We feel that analogous examples do not need to share common words, content, or sentence structure. What is important is that they *point to latent factors* that may be responsible for the model's output.",
"**Purpose of analogies:**",
"Overall, we agree that there could be other experimental designs which are worthy of investigation.",
"The main reason to accept this paper is empirical results, showing performance on the various methods.",
"The author has done plenty of case studies to verify the explanation and with many examples of the proposed explanation method. \n\n",
"I'm tending to accept this paper as it is well written and provides interesting and novel approaches to explain similarity-based methods.",
"The authors present two methods to generate explanations, called Feature-based similarity explanations and analogy-based similarity explanations, where the latter one is a novel type of explanations explicitly developed to explain similarity learners.",
"Since the proposed setting (analogies) is novel, previous approaches compared with needed adaptations to fit the setting.",
"In addition, the proposed method of analogy-based-explanation seems novel.",
"The explicit treatment of diversity sets it apart from other explanation methods that also use whole data point for explanation, such as counterfactuals.",
"The authors solved this problem by the use of a learned local distance matrix, in which interaction effects are clearly shown."

Example summary of the input fragments:

The proposed approach to explain similarity prediction is a relatively less explored area, which makes the problem addressed and the proposed method unique.


Example input review fragments:

"We will add some text discussing the limitations of our method for the camera-ready version.",
"We will add a discussion of this limitation (and others) in the final camera-ready version.",
"We agree that there was not enough attention devoted to this in the current version, and will include a discussion in the camera-ready version.",
"The paper could be further improved with some reflection on the limitations of the approach.",
"Thank you for reviewing our manuscript, and for your encouraging feedback! ",
"Experiments on a variety of regression problems demonstrate the superiority of their algorithm over current state-of-the-art coreset compression and variational-flow-based methods.",
"The paper is technically sound, and the claims are carefully developed and well supported.",
"The manuscript is well structured and very clearly written, with helpful introductions to the methodological ingredients that it builds upon.",
"The paper could be further improved with some reflection on the limitations of the approach.",
"I am not certain how large a contribution it will have to the field of Bayesian inference in general.",
"The paper constitutes a significant contribution within research on Bayesian coresets, both in terms of methodology and measured in terms of the performance improvements over other methods.",
"I want to help where I can. In case something is unclear, feel free to ask follow-up questions. ",
"All of this combined already warrants publication in my opinion. ",
"I think, the limitations of the method were discussed insufficiently and should be addressed as described in questions 1 and 2. ",
"In short, I think the paper is good and should be published with minor revisions. ",
"I\u2019ll use the rest of the section for high-level comments.",
"- In its current form, the paper convinces me that SHF decreases runtime and increases performance for datasets with low complexity."

Example summary of the input fragments:

Based on these, I recommend acceptance for this paper. All reviewers agree that the paper proposes an interesting approach to Bayesian inference incorporating coresets with Hamiltonian flows.
