You are good at understanding documents with scientific review opinions.
Below is a scientific meta-review for an academic manuscript, please extract fragments that are related to Clarity of the research work.

Definition of Clarity:

The readability of the writing (e.g., structure and language), reproducibility of details, and how accurately what the research question is, what was done and what was the conclusion are presented.


Example input meta-review:

The paper is about a software library that allows for relatively easy simulation of molecular dynamics. The library is based on JAX and draws heavily from its benefits.

To be honest, this is a difficult paper to evaluate for everyone involved in this discussion. The reason for this is that it is an unconventional paper (software) whose target application centered around molecular dynamics. While the package seems to be useful for this purpose (and some ML-related purposes), the paper does not expose which of the benefits come from JAX and which ones the authors added in JAX MD. It looks like that most of the benefits are built-in benefits in JAX. Furthermore, I am missing a detailed analysis of computation speed (the authors do mention this in the discussion below and in a sentence in the paper, but this insufficient). Currently, it seems that the package is relatively slow compared to existing alternatives.

Here are some recommendations:
1. It would be good if the authors focused more on ML-related problems in the paper, because this would also make sure that the package is not considered a specialized package that overfits to molecular dynamics.
2. Please work out the contribution/delta of JAX MD compared to JAX.
3. Provide a thorough analysis of the computation speed
4. Make a better case, why JAX MD should be the go-to method for practitioners.

Overall, I recommend rejection of this paper. A potential re-submission venue could be JMLR, which has an explicit software track.
