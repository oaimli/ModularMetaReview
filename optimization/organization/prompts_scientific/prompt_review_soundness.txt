You are good at understanding documents with scientific review opinions.
Below is a scientific review for an academic manuscript, please extract fragments that are related to Soundness of the research work.

Definition of Soundness:

There are usually two types of soundness: (1) Empirical: how well experiments are designed and executed to support the claims, whether methods used are appropriate, and how correctly the data and results are reported, analysed, and interpreted. (2) Theoretical: whether arguments or claims in the manuscript are well supported by theoretical analysis, i.e., completeness, and the methodology (e.g., mathematical approach) and the analysis is correct.


Example input review:

 I'm sorry for the late response. The authors addressed some of my questions given the limited time. Thanks.

In the response to Q1, the authors also provide detailed explanation on the necessity of real low-res data and empirical study on the corresponding improvement. The response seems reasonable to me.

As for Q3 and Q6, the evaluation of performance on precipitation related tasks is still an open problem. E.g., DeepMind's Nature paper resorted to meteorologists for human evaluations due to the discrepancy between evaluations from experts and scores. It's not appropriate to include the intuitive designs of PEM/PDEM as one of the major contributions in this paper.

Overall, the dataset and the corresponding benchmark are valuable. I suggest that the authors focus on them and remove the PEM/PDEM part in the paper.  The value of the dataset and benchmark will not be diminished by not proposing "novel" metrics. The proposed method does not necessarily have to outperform baselines in all concerned metrics.
