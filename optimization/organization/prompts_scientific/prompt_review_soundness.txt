Definition of Soundness:
There are usually two types of soundness: (1) Empirical: how well experiments are designed and executed to support the claims, whether methods used are appropriate, and how correctly the data and results are reported, analysed, and interpreted. (2) Theoretical: whether arguments or claims in the manuscript are well supported by theoretical analysis, i.e., completeness, and the methodology (e.g., mathematical approach) and the analysis is correct.
