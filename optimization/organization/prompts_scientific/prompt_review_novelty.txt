You are good at understanding documents with scientific review opinions.
Below is a scientific review for an academic manuscript, please extract fragments that make comments on Novelty of the research work.

Definition of Novelty:
How original the idea (e.g., tasks, datasets, or methods) is, and how clear where the problems and methods sit with respect to existing literature (i.e., meaningful comparison).


Example input review:

 Thank you very much for your interest in our work and for your valuable comments. This would be an important work bridging meteorology and computer science. In this paper, we propose the ***first*** large-scale dataset for precipitation downscaling that is based on real measured data while the previous models are usually evaluated on synthetic datasets (downsampling the radar maps to generate the synthetic low/high-resolution pairs) and no formal dataset released previously. Under the general trend of the times, it is always good to extend from AI to AI+X. Alphafold's success is such a good example, which tells that deep and well-communicated interaction between AI and other fields could stimulate large scientific breakthroughs. Downscaling is one of the most important tasks in current meteorological research, and the combination with deep learning is also the main research trend [1]. We believe this paper is also a meaningful and successful one and time proves it. To accomplish this work, great and difficult communications between computer science and meteorology side have been done to ensure this precipitation down-scaling is the most important and cutting-edge meteorological task that could be handle by computer science.

For the technical novelty concern.

Our work demonstrates its novelty in two aspects:

1.The first large-scale open-source dataset for precipitation downscaling that is based on real measured data as described above, which will greatly help bridge the DL/ML community with meteorological science, while promoting the development of AI-for-Science.

2.Novel benchmark model structure design and performance. Existing VSR methods generally include motion estimation modules, which are composed of modules (e.g., PCD in EDVR, Projection Module in RBPN, etc.) with strong video dynamics assumptions. As mentioned in our paper, the assumptions do not match precipitation downscaling. Unlike them, our implicit dynamic estimation module (IDEM) is a low inductive-bias module (e.g., transformers outperform CNNs), it only contains N-2 (N is the input adjacent frames, 5 frames in our model setting) weight-sharing small networks, so that IDEM can explore the inherent laws in the precipitation data without constraints/assumptions. In addition, self-attention, as a low inductive-bias operator, has achieved huge performance improvements in computer vision tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, etc.). The low inductive-bias setting allows self-attention to fully explore the inherent laws within the data without being constrained by data assumptions [2]. At the same time, the self-attention operator also exhibits stronger generalization ability. Analogously, this is also the potential reason why our IDEM works better on the precipitation dataset. The results in Table 1 (in our paper) show the superiority of our model. Furthermore, our IDEM module also shows very competitive performance on the VSR data set: Vid4(4Ã—) Average RGB PSNR 25.85 (EDVR Average RGB PSNR 25.83, DUF Average RGB PSNR 25.79). We will add more details (novelty analysis and performance analysis in VSR task) about the proposed model in Sec.5 and Sec.6.

Q1: Eastern coast of US has been selected for data collections. What about other regions ?

A1: Thank you for your constructive comments. There several reasons for selecting the eastern coast of US.
1. Compared with other regions in the world, the US has systematic and complete observational data (NLDAS (lower-resolution) covers 1980-now, and StageIV (higher-resolution) covers 2002-now) of various resolutions from different observational systems (e.g., satellite, weather radar, etc.).
2. Compared to the eastern US, the West Coast has very little precipitation, which is not helpful for our task, so we discarded the West Coast to reduce the redundancy of the dataset.
3. In our future work, we will expand to more regions of the world.
