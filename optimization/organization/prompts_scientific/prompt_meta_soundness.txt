You are good at understanding documents with scientific review opinions.
Below is a scientific meta-review for an academic manuscript, please extract fragments that make comments on Soundness of the research work.

Definition of Soundness:
There are usually two types of soundness: (1) Empirical: how well experiments are designed and executed to support the claims, whether methods used are appropriate, and how correctly the data and results are reported, analysed, and interpreted. (2) Theoretical: whether arguments or claims in the manuscript are well supported by theoretical analysis, i.e., completeness, and the methodology (e.g., mathematical approach) and the analysis is correct.


Example input meta-review:

The paper proposes to use the mirror descent algorithm for the binary network. It is easy to read. However, novelty over ProxQuant is somehow limited. The theoretical analysis is weak, in that there is no analysis on the convergence and neither how to choose the projection for mirror mapping construction. Experimental results can also be made more convincing, by adding comparisons with bigger datasets, STOA networks, and ablation study to demonstrate why mirror descent is better than proximal gradient descent in this application.
